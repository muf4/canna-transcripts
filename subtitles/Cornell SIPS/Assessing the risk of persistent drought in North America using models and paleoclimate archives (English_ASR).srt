1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,839
University usually when you give a talk

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,080
you know you you try to connect yourself

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,439
to the place you know like oh the last

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,719
time I was here was 15 years ago when I

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,320
was skiing and whatever it's like the

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,239
last time I was here was when I came in

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,439
this morning and went up the elevator um

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,439
but anyway it's really nice to be

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,079
talking to a familiar group of faces and

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,000
this is some work that's been ongoing

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,479
for several years a little bit of it uh

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
will be familiar to those of you who saw

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,119
my talk when I interviewed here um in

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,799
2012 and that was

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,558
a was an eventful time in the Boulder

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:50,558
Colorado I was there for the summer of

18
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:52,439
2012 and this is the picture I took when

19
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,558
we were evacuated from the Mesa lab

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,718
which doesn't show up well but it's

21
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:59,439
right here in June during the big

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,480
wildfires this is the same month when a

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,799
lot of color Springs was devastated by

24
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,200
wildfires we actually saw the lightning

25
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,239
strike that started this one I was on

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,640
the top floor of the Mesa Lab at office

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,399
mates who had Westward facing windows

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
and doors they opened up the doors to go

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,439
out and look at the Big Smoke as it was

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
starting to accumulate and then the wind

31
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,158
started to change and then it started to

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,519
blow smoke into the offices and then the

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,600
loudspeaker came on you know the

34
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,640
announcement that we needed to evacuate

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,919
the building I took this picture on the

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,920
way down from my bike on my iPhone uh

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,239
later that

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,118
summer many of you will know be familiar

39
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:36,560
with the drought um it's at a wedding in

40
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,200
Iowa they were calling it The Great corn

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,920
Apocalypse of

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,478
2012 and this is a picture of what some

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,359
of the effects look like after all this

44
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,239
end of the end of the summer getting

45
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,239
back after being evacuated into the lab

46
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,798
my adviser at the time Clara deser was a

47
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,039
climate scientist works at Mesa lab

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,880
asked me she knew I was working on Mega

49
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,320
drought forong Dr she asked if this if

50
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,640
what we were experiencing in 2012 was a

51
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,639
mega drought and of course I wanted to

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,159
give a really good answer so I was like

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,038
yes well no

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,560
maybe and I should have said what I

55
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,399
should have said what I realized now

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,199
what I should have said then was ask me

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,280
in 35 years because megga drought the

58
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,639
definition is really uh dependent on

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,598
this time scale of a prolonged period of

60
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,039
idity and the question remains people

61
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,959
still people still want to know are we

62
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,519
in a mega drought um in particular when

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,560
your position is extreme weather during

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,319
climate change at Cornell University

65
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,840
people ask you uh is it a mega drought

66
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:47,359
now I have a good answer wait 32

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,878
years get back to you so this is current

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,319
conditions uh this is probably going to

69
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,120
weaken a little bit this will Abate a

70
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,878
little bit with the big giant rainfall

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,759
events that are happening right now in

72
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,560
the Southeast um the West is very dry

73
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,199
anomalously dry as you can can

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,039
see and the definition I'm using the

75
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,199
Wikipedia definition because I think I

76
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,639
know who wrote it and it captures a lot

77
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,919
of what the scientific literature up

78
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,359
till recently has been saying about this

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,798
term megga drought I'll let you read it

80
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,080
yourself I learned something interesting

81
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,480
about the world of the internet when I

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,000
gave a talk at agu a number of years ago

83
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,919
about megad drout and I read my

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,318
definition out

85
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,079
loud so therefore you can quote

86
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:37,679
Professor saying that they

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,319
constitute a threat to

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,200
civilization if you are USA Today so

89
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,560
graduate students in particular be

90
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,359
careful what you say um historically

91
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,840
that's an accurate statement prolonged

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,760
periods of aridity in the past in past

93
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,519
Mill over the past Millennia or two have

94
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,759
been linked to the demise of some very

95
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,039
famous uh pre-industrial Empires now

96
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,158
does that mean there are a threat to

97
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,519
civilization today very different

98
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:08,479
question let me just go

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,158
over some other events that are

100
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,679
noteworthy because they have been either

101
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,279
correctly or not they've been labeled or

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,400
attributed to being U Mega DRS there's a

103
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,918
dust bow which is about a decade six

104
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,799
years a really bad drought a decade

105
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,120
total if you look at the

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,680
average on this we've got the Palmer

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,560
drought severity access uh index on the

108
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,560
y- axis plotted downward

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
and the

110
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,679
duration up here and then the size of

111
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,839
the dots that I'm going to show is the

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,519
spatial extent so these are all these

113
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,478
have all been events that have in some

114
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,120
published literature been termed Mega

115
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,038
drought or at least prolong

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,478
drought Australia is Big Dry it's a

117
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,000
little bit smaller a little less severe

118
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,000
but still very

119
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,439
consequential Amazon drought of 2005 and

120
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,120
also you could add 2011 to this it was

121
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:08,439
similar in scale I think

122
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,360
and was not very long lived sub annual

123
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:14,319
but it had a strong impact on fire and

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,319
carbon in the area as I understand dry

125
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,399
down a lot of the forest and it was

126
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,800
related to a I think a prolonged dry

127
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,279
season just a very badly timed wave in

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,038
the atmosphere that pushed out the

129
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,638
moisture for an extra few weeks leading

130
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,519
to the drop but a shortlived very

131
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,800
shortlived and big and then the uh the

132
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,959
big big granddaddy of them all is of

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,759
course the SEL drought which was very

134
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,799
consequential for parts of Africa and

135
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,199
the effects are probably still being

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,680
felt in the region

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,560
today so there's this distinction maybe

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,439
that had been made still gets made in a

139
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,680
lot of high-profile papers on this

140
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,519
between what we would kind of probably

141
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
call drought versus mega drought uh on

142
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,879
the drought side you might have things

143
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,080
like you know the 2012 event

144
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,600
shortlived and but then when it starts

145
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,318
to get out to being really impactful

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,680
headline grabbing uh it's very it's very

147
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,720
attractive to start calling it a megga

148
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,199
it's a very compelling term to use a

149
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,120
drought that is having a very strong

150
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,720
visible impact and so there wasn't I

151
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,319
mean the line is very blurry and the

152
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,080
line is blurry because primarily the the

153
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,439
term is a compelling word to use when

154
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,038
you're trying to get grants funded and

155
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,560
papers published we tried to be a little

156
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,759
more quantitative we looked you know we

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,120
actually started looking at this even

158
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,280
multi-millennial

159
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,439
scale periods of dryness in the

160
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,038
southwest other parts of the

161
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,079
world happening on you know during the

162
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:44,918
ice ages right you've got thousands of

163
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,519
years where climate just dries up those

164
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,959
multi- Thousand Year events were being

165
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,719
called Mega drought in some of the

166
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:53,159
papers um so you've got what six orders

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,319
of magnitude uh in time being covered by

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,879
this this blanket term megga drought

169
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
when I talk about Mega drought in this

170
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,520
talk and in the stuff that we've been

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,639
doing

172
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,399
when I'm talking about Mega drought I'm

173
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,240
really thinking about multi- decadal

174
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,758
drought multiple decades anything

175
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,160
shorter like one decade tried to call

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,720
decadal drought and a lot longer than a

177
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,680
few decades and we have to start

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,039
thinking about whether or not it's

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,879
driven by climate change either natural

180
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,878
or unforced but climate change not

181
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,879
necessarily a interval that is dry for a

182
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,439
period of decades and then returns to

183
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,520
being normal and because we're talking

184
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,719
about events that unfold that evolve

185
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:34,079
over multiple decades they're really at

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,800
the edge of all the different types of

187
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,918
observational apparatuses or methods of

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,520
inference that we have so we don't have

189
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,758
historical records going back thousands

190
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,120
of years and we certainly don't have

191
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,879
satellites going back for more than just

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,360
a few decades so what I this is a

193
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,479
schematic diagram that I put together

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,639
and you can see the time scale here and

195
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:56,560
think of this as like the quality of the

196
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,840
data the resolution of the

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,240
data the Precision that's what I'm

198
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:04,279
calling it here so for satellites you've

199
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,240
got a lot of detailed information but

200
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,119
only for a few decades instrumental data

201
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,879
the detail is not as SP the data is not

202
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,800
as spatially complete but it's still

203
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,759
pretty good but you can't quite go down

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,439
maybe in all cases everywhere globally

205
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,759
to the same high frequency end of the

206
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,158
end of the time scales can't go down to

207
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,080
days in most cases with observational

208
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,120
data

209
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,918
globally um and then there you've got

210
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,918
drought and you've got weather as events

211
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:32,038
that happen we move out to study rout

212
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,000
some of the best evidence and I'm going

213
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:34,879
to talk about this today comes from

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,080
paleo climate archives for the fact

215
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,360
they've happened in the

216
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,639
past and then in the very top here the

217
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,680
the global climate models you could say

218
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,159
are legitimate on these time scills

219
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,679
they're being run with boundary

220
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,439
conditions designed to simulate the

221
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,319
natural variability in the climate

222
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,880
system over the last Millennium and

223
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,519
they're certainly able to generate data

224
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,480
on time scales of days all the way out

225
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,480
to Millennia and there's no problem

226
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,600
problem with measuring the variables

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,360
that are simulated by a climate model

228
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,040
they're directly simulated but they are

229
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,000
at best approximations of reality the

230
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,039
colleague who likes to call them

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,879
earthlike planets these Global Climate

232
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:20,120
models are earthlike planets they have

233
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,200
many I'm glad I made thank you three

234
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,799
people um and then we've got climate

235
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
change all the way out here on the top

236
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,559
which is unfolding over centuries and

237
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,759
mega drought is really right here where

238
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,119
you can try and use the different types

239
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,399
of methods of inference the different

240
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,278
data products available that are

241
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,440
legitimate on these time Horizons to say

242
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,439
something about the

243
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,040
characteristics of these events in the

244
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,560
past so you got proxies P climate

245
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,679
archives like tree rings instrumental

246
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,679
data and

247
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,920
gcms

248
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,600
and wanted to show some pictures of

249
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,240
decadal drought

250
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,079
most saling example of course the Dust

251
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,278
Bowl in the US this is April 14th black

252
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,159
Sunday I believe right black Sunday

253
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,159
April 14th you can see this wall of dust

254
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,319
moving

255
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,559
in it's catastrophic people who have

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,360
read the book uh the worst Hard Times

257
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,319
see the PBS documentary uh Ken Burns be

258
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,680
familiar with the idea that the dust was

259
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,320
killing people um infants and and

260
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,838
elderly people in particular were very

261
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,079
seriously affected by the dust it caused

262
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,000
the type of pneumonia called dust

263
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,120
pneumonia just from the inhalation uh

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,360
it's really really damaging I don't need

265
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,679
to tell you guys this this is when I'm

266
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,480
talking to climate scientists I sell

267
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,399
this all

268
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,920
right 1950s this is a picture from 1950s

269
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,759
drought lesser known maybe not as

270
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,799
visible saling example but certainly

271
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,319
very painful for agriculture for farmers

272
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,039
and Growers who lived in Southwest

273
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,278
during that time in fact after some of

274
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,319
these studies came out I got an email

275
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,159
from a Cornell

276
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,360
Alum um saying that you know his family

277
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,958
has been growing crops in Texas remember

278
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,200
the 1950s being really really

279
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:10,559
bad multi-year intervals of aridity that

280
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,519
were really really bad and that's all in

281
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,799
my bin in my notion of drought the bin

282
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,480
of decadal

283
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,519
drought you go up 10 years in either

284
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,639
direction from these events you're not

285
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,278
really seeing the same effects as during

286
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,278
that decade of

287
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,360
Dr it also lends itself to a pretty

288
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,839
convenient um method for detecting decal

289
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,680
and multi- deal droughts because if you

290
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,560
just look at the precipitation anomalies

291
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,919
alone pick your favorite index favorite

292
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,518
drought index and there's lots of them

293
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:49,399
and they lead you to a similar story but

294
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,360
just take precipitation alone right here

295
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,679
we've got in Gray precipitation totals

296
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,680
the Great

297
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,839
Plains annual averages in black is a

298
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,399
smoothing curve like a 10year moving

299
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,320
average and then here we've got one half

300
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,320
of one standard deviation and you can

301
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,760
see that the black curve stays below one

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,199
half of one standard deviation for the

303
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:17,000
entire period of the

304
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:18,838
Dr it's a objective metric that lets us

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,559
pull out these things from data apply

306
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,480
the same thing and you can see the same

307
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,838
type of uh threshold applies to the

308
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,920
Southwest drought during the 1950s so

309
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,720
just as as as a starting point for a

310
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,000
definition of a drought that we know

311
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,639
would be bad be as much of a

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,879
precipitation deficit that we saw during

313
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,159
the 1950s and 1930s this works half a

314
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,198
standard deviation in the long-term

315
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,198
average the 10e average seems to seems

316
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,759
to identify these intervals and not sply

317
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,919
identify other intervals which is

318
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,120
good we got precipitation we've got

319
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,319
moisture we've got tree ring

320
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,240
measurements we can try to apply this to

321
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,480
picture of Connie Woodhouse right there

322
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,799
up on a mountain side in the I think

323
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,800
it's the San wien mountains and Southern

324
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:05,599
Colorado cing a tree I got to go out

325
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,799
with the tree ring folks once only once

326
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,879
when I was at the University of Arizona

327
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,439
during my graduate work and I think I

328
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,198
was able to core about three trees in

329
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,480
the time that one of these Superstar

330
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:17,240
dendro climatologists CED like 24 and I

331
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,639
was super sore the next day you go on

332
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,560
these Swedish coring devices and

333
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,759
cranking and it's exhausting work I mean

334
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,958
maybe some of you do it I uh I I always

335
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,399
thought I was really like in good shape

336
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,559
too like I go to the gym I can go out

337
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,519
there and cor trees with these dendri

338
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,599
climatologist no they're zipping up and

339
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,600
down these like 45 degre slope mountains

340
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,120
onree and drilling out cores of trees at

341
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,199
a rate that is uh it's impressive it's

342
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,240
very

343
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,479
impressive at the time when I was at

344
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,839
graduate school at the University

345
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,879
Arizona the world famous tree ring lab

346
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,120
dendra

347
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:54,120
climatology was right underneath

348
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,799
here then the stadium of Arizona of the

349
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,600
Arizona football stadium and I was uh I

350
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,879
was persuaded upon by a good friend

351
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,240
colleague

352
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,559
Scott St George and Kevin antis both of

353
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,159
who had finished a few years before me

354
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,159
to go and see if I could convince Dave

355
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,159
moo who's world famous dendro

356
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,838
climatologist um who's someone in the

357
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,838
room I know has worked on with various

358
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,120
papers and proposals um convince him if

359
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,639
I could do a study abroad in his office

360
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,879
across campus in the uh in the dendra

361
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,839
climatology lab this very convenient on

362
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,439
a Saturday if you're working on a

363
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,040
Saturday you know and you want some

364
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,839
nachos you just go just go right across

365
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,159
the hall and get your nachos from the

366
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,920
concession stand and then go back to

367
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,958
work and of course this is like Rich

368
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:40,319
Woody smell in all the labs in all the

369
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,039
offices and the guys that work there

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,040
have these big beards they've been doing

371
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,198
it forever and you feel like you're in

372
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,599
Lord of the Rings I mean you feel like

373
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,120
you're just surrounded by ants

374
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,440
or or some mythical creatures they go

375
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,000
out into the forest with superpowers and

376
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,079
bring back climate archives and so one

377
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,078
of the things that I learned about when

378
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:59,879
I was there I was very interested in

379
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,278
this idea of how well can we make

380
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,078
inferences from puring data about low

381
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,838
frequency variability in hydroclimate

382
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:06,439
and how might that inform our

383
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,880
understanding of drought statistics

384
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,320
particularly Mega drought statistics on

385
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,320
these multi- decadal even

386
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,440
multi-millennial time Horizons so you go

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,839
the tree you go into the field in the

388
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,160
summer and make a bunch of drill a bunch

389
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,720
of cores which look about like this

390
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,240
bring them back to the lab measure the

391
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,680
ring widths and then they usually just

392
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,000
get plotted up to begin with as ring

393
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,439
width measurement indices not even

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,600
indices they just ring width

395
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,880
measurements so this is just raw ring

396
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,000
width from what one two three four five

397
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,480
six different trees nothing has been

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,159
done to massage the data it's just what

399
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
you get when you get back to the lab and

400
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,879
you spend your time measuring up there's

401
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,199
also a very important step that gets

402
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,838
overlooked and has been overlooked in

403
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,719
some very high-profile high impact

404
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,800
papers it's important to understand and

405
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,278
it's how these things are aligned in

406
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,439
time it's a very quantitative very

407
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,838
precise science and sequences of

408
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,720
relatively wide and narrow rings are

409
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,759
very good indicators of of a time period

410
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,079
they're like a barcode they're unique

411
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,399
and they can be used to match where

412
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,359
things must align in time and they have

413
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,318
been and they're also very effective for

414
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,639
identifying places where growth is

415
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:20,240
missing during a year be happy to talk

416
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,480
about that after the talk but the main

417
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,600
point here is that in this case most of

418
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
these actually ended when the tree was

419
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,560
sampled and then you can just count time

420
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,440
going backwards on the x-axis here

421
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:39,559
raw ring width

422
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:43,240
measurements typically one then tries to

423
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,278
model the non-climate influences on tree

424
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,480
ring

425
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,480
growth this is important going through

426
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,759
it in a lot of detail because it's

427
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,278
really important to our understanding of

428
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,278
Mega drought fundamentally

429
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,880
overall in this case I I fit a spline

430
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,198
just a smoothing curve to the ring width

431
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,279
indices to try to estimate the

432
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,959
non-climate sources of growth typically

433
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,240
splines are set to be um you know

434
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,959
removing 100% of the variance at 2third

435
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,439
the length of the segment other more

436
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,558
stiff splines might be something like a

437
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,000
negative exponential that models growth

438
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,918
as being very sharp in the beginning and

439
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,279
then decaying rapidly other ones still

440
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,559
are more flexible the latest and

441
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,599
greatest best methods best practices for

442
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:27,558
D trending try to estimate the growth

443
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,359
from each individual site as a residual

444
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,119
um once you factor in the total

445
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,798
cumulative growth across sites that

446
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,319
makes sense there's lots of different

447
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,119
methods and it's really important on the

448
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,439
long time scales to get it right or at

449
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,678
least to be able to quantify and

450
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,679
understand what you're missing or what

451
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,960
you might be missing and what you're

452
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,919
removing because typically you're

453
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,319
chopping out the low frequency end of

454
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,200
the spectrum you're chopping out the low

455
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,839
frequency variability if for no other

456
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,480
reason then the simplest possible case a

457
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,359
tree is putting on the same amount of

458
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,400
carbon each year but because its radius

459
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,319
is getting bigger the width of the Ring

460
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,120
has to get smaller there's more going on

461
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,839
in real trees right there's biological

462
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,798
processes they shift away from using

463
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,720
resources to grow towards using

464
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,879
resources for reproduction so there's

465
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,038
all kinds of non-climate sources of

466
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,159
variability on these multi- deal to

467
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,839
Century time scales that need to be

468
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,880
accounted for or factored in or

469
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,839
investigated if we want to get it at

470
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
this problem of

471
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,439
megadrop once those once that's been

472
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,079
done you usually do a det trending using

473
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,159
those spines imagine subtracting that

474
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,480
there's a second step that's often

475
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,520
applied to standardize them to unit VAR

476
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,798
and that's what we've got here so these

477
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,119
are ring width indices now not

478
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,480
measurements anymore they've been

479
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,119
trended and standardized to be ring

480
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,120
width indices and this is just a subset

481
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,359
from one site I think in the sane

482
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,519
mountains as

483
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,000
well usually there'll be a few dozen

484
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,440
trees going into a

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,679
compilation of ring width indices you

486
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
make a compilation of ring withth

487
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,320
indices you've got tree ring

488
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:59,359
chronology and that's what I've done

489
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:01,639
here just for illustrative purposes

490
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,038
the chronology it's like a weighted

491
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,400
average or an average of the individual

492
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,720
constituent ringing withd indices via

493
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,038
the central limit

494
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,360
theorem and it's important to factor in

495
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:17,919
in our understanding of hydro climate

496
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,519
and trees that these sites have been

497
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,320
pre-selected to be moisture sensitive

498
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,759
you're in the southwest they go out to

499
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,519
parts of the mountains where it's very

500
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,879
likely that moisture is the limiting

501
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,158
factor on growth you go to high up up

502
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,880
it's probably temperature you go too low

503
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,600
well you're in Cactus in the southwest

504
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,840
in this middle Zone you got Long Live

505
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,279
trees and moisture is the primary

506
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,839
limiting factor on growth which gives

507
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,918
you a good chance of being able to

508
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,678
reconstruct moisture variables like the

509
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,320
Palmer drought severity index like

510
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,280
precipitation like Colorado Stream flow

511
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,399
and those reconstructions now are

512
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,079
derived from sets of chronologies so

513
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,798
dozens of ring width measurements go

514
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,319
into making ring width indices ring

515
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,119
width indices are then average together

516
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,879
to make chronologies chronologies then

517
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,879
are used to do a single

518
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
reconstruction again via the central

519
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,840
limit theorem we hope this all works out

520
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,879
but it might not work out the same way

521
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,399
on different time scales and that's

522
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,600
something that's active area of

523
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,840
research in the case of the Colorado

524
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,719
River this is from Mo at all 2007 the

525
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,519
same Dave

526
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:27,038
Mo I shared an office with for a little

527
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,879
while a reconstructed flow as a

528
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:32,798
percentage of the 20 Century mean so

529
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,559
100% the 20th century mean very famous

530
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,720
figure this is probably one of the most

531
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:40,599
widely used paleoclimate results out

532
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,200
there observe flow in Black this is the

533
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,798
25e running

534
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,720
mean that's the thick black line the

535
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,279
thin black line is the smoothing same

536
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,600
smoothing 25e running mean of the

537
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,918
Reconstruction the gray shading is are

538
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,279
the uh the confidence limits and what

539
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,679
you can see is this event back in the

540
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:04,079
1150s among others drops below

541
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:07,240
87% of the 20th century mean for at

542
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:10,519
least one year and actually in the case

543
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,640
of 1150s it's about 11 years this is not

544
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,319
a great definition of megadrought it's

545
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,038
very hard to communicate that we're

546
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:21,038
talking about the um an interval that's

547
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:24,759
characterized by an 11-year drop in the

548
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:27,679
25-year running mean at 87% below of

549
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,960
20th century averages so we tried that

550
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
definition for a while we had a bunch of

551
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
papers rejected with that definition we

552
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,720
tried to simplify which is why I

553
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,079
introduced the other one that we're

554
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,440
going to actually use for this analysis

555
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:43,399
there's one event that satisfies those

556
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:45,278
criteria uh 11 year 11 years below 87%

557
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,960
of the 20th century mean in the 25 year

558
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,400
ring average there's one event and it's

559
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
the 1150s megadrought that's been um

560
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,960
incorporated into a lot of decision-

561
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
making about how to use water resources

562
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,679
in the

563
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,440
Colorado and if you just look at the

564
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,919
point when Flo gets that same 87%

565
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,360
threshold there are a few other

566
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,880
intervals and these have all been called

567
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,879
Mead drought I would call them deal

568
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:15,038
drought maybe that 1150s drought

569
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,960
qualifies as a mega drought multiple

570
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:23,200
years 25 year running

571
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,640
me can and we can then look at other

572
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,679
hydroclimate reconstructions from the

573
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,120
same

574
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,840
region up here just pull out all those

575
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,798
places that I circled before to show you

576
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,918
these decal

577
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,278
droughts and they're happening at about

578
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,200
a rate of one to two times per Century

579
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:40,359
it's a good Benchmark and if you look at

580
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,720
some of these other reconstructions this

581
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,399
is the Palmer drought severity index

582
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,120
also reconstructed from trees also for

583
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,480
the Southwest they're

584
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,839
not completely in sync even though it's

585
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,839
a similar

586
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,000
region which is interesting in and of

587
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,439
itself but you do get a similar rate one

588
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,679
to two of these decal droughts per

589
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,640
century this is from Stadol 2011 also a

590
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,600
pdsi Reconstruction from northern Mexico

591
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,919
now and it's important again to notice

592
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,119
that it's not like these events are

593
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,000
lining up in time so there is maybe a an

594
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,278
inherent spatial scale there's

595
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,200
information there that we can use to try

596
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:19,319
and understand the nature of these

597
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,080
prolonged

598
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:24,200
droughts all right and then if we go

599
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,000
back even

600
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,159
further apply a more rigorous smoothing

601
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,159
look for intervals that are below this

602
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,480
Nega 5 standard deviation negative nea5

603
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,880
standard deviation the running mean the

604
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,200
35e running mean there's really only

605
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,559
three not as the North American drought

606
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,640
Atlas and this gives us an answer to a

607
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,798
question that a lot of people been

608
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,880
asking for a long time and I think the

609
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:52,679
first paper to address this was in 1998

610
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,679
by Jonathan overp was one of the my

611
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,400
advisers in

612
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,038
Arizona and their answer back in 1998 to

613
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,000
this question of How likely our Mega

614
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,798
droughts from a paleoclimate

615
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,599
perspective was that decal droughts look

616
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:08,599
like they

617
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:10,759
were occurring once or twice per Century

618
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,599
perfectly consistent with our idea of

619
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,278
the 1930s Dust Bowl as well as the 1950s

620
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,158
drought in the southwest decal droughts

621
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,119
occurring once or twice per century and

622
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,600
these multi- deal Mega droughts now

623
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:25,158
multi- deal Mega drought 35e interval

624
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,918
35e period of idity maybe one or two per

625
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:31,240
Millennium very rare events and these

626
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,919
statistics seem pretty much to hold up

627
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,319
um there initial estimates from 1998

628
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,600
held up pretty well with our more

629
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:41,519
quantitative analysis of more data ended

630
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:44,359
up in the same

631
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:47,038
ballpark

632
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,240
now to get at the likelihood of

633
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,879
megadroughts we want to know something

634
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,278
about the past from the pale climate

635
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
perspective from three width

636
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:56,759
measurements with indices we also want

637
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,398
to know something about the underlying

638
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,119
statistical characteristics of

639
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:02,398
hydroclimate in the region and a really

640
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,798
convenient tool especially if you're

641
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:08,158
comparing with models is the power

642
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:11,480
spectrum and specifically the the color

643
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,440
quote unquote of the power Spectrum so

644
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,720
if we've got time scale here on the

645
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,080
x-axis and amplitude some hydroclimate

646
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,679
variable pdsi Stream flow a red spectrum

647
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,798
is going to have generally more variance

648
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,240
on the time scales white would be like a

649
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,960
uniform distribution of variance across

650
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,640
time scales and blue you don't see in

651
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,120
very many natural systems but you do do

652
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,840
in some of these earthlike

653
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,918
gcms a great example of this is the

654
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,918
community climate System model 3 so a

655
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,480
couple Generations ago it would give you

656
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,480
an elino linia cycle every other year so

657
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,599
be elino Lino it's like a ping pong ball

658
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,278
being batted back and forth from one

659
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,158
side of the table to the other well if

660
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,480
you're sampling that at an annual

661
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,480
resolution you're going to get this big

662
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,120
peak right at the Nyquist frequency and

663
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,278
that would be like a blue Power Spectrum

664
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,719
where the variance is pushed away from

665
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,880
the long time scales and concentrated at

666
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,759
the shortest one

667
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,559
so in nature they're I guess relatively

668
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,200
rare I think um I think the people who

669
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,918
do uh seismic Imaging have to worry

670
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,880
about that kind of a spectrum but

671
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,799
they're relatively rare in

672
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,159
nature this was a paper result from a

673
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:18,759
paper from hoers and Curry in 2006 very

674
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,440
important very significant

675
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,038
paleoclimate uh result where they looked

676
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,399
at the power Spectre of

677
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:29,200
temperature so not hydroclimate per se

678
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,398
but temperature across

679
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,600
you know several orders of magnitude so

680
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,158
from seasonal all the way out to

681
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,000
Millennial multimillennial so we're

682
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,278
talking from milankovich down to

683
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,640
seasonal time scales and they argue that

684
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,038
there's this just general redness

685
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,480
steepness to the spectral slope that's

686
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:49,599
positive for temperature uh up to

687
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,880
Century long time scales here there's

688
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,879
some inflection point and then you go

689
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,159
down to more of the um sort of the the

690
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,919
nonlinear Brownian motion regime which

691
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,919
is really potentially very interesting

692
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,000
from a long time scale climate Dynamics

693
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,320
perspective and may have some

694
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,960
implications for climate change and I

695
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,319
was really just interested in adapting

696
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,679
this whole framework to hydroclimate to

697
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,879
ask if we could come up with a similar

698
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,759
type of diagram from hydroclimate

699
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
proxies and compare them with

700
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,038
temperature to compare the power

701
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,678
spectrum of hydroclimate because

702
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,359
presumably if you have very red power

703
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,080
spectr and power Spectra that are red on

704
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,439
long time scales that would mean

705
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,639
something different about the risks of

706
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,240
Mega drought because you'd be able to

707
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,759
stay in a in a dry regime for a long

708
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,079
time because there's a high amplitude at

709
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,558
the low frequency time scales versus if

710
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,639
you have a a white dur a blue Power

711
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,119
spectrum and one thing though that makes

712
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,600
this a little more

713
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:48,079
complicated for moisture soil moisture

714
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,639
and other archives of hydroclimate as

715
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,278
opposed to temperature is

716
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,880
storage so the hyers and Curry paper is

717
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,960
able to get away with using very coarse

718
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,159
resolution proxies proxies that are

719
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,440
geochemical that have you know

720
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,120
relatively small basins to worry about

721
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,798
with with mixing time scales of maybe a

722
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,839
few decades or even a few hundred years

723
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,079
or even if you're you know if you're

724
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,639
looking at the kako base and you're

725
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,599
worried about the whole ocean you still

726
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,600
are only worrying about a few Millennia

727
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,158
and they're going out to hundreds of

728
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,278
Millennia whereas for Mega drought for

729
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,559
decadal Drought we do have to think

730
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:23,720
about what effects are we going to have

731
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,599
of the sensor the tree ring measurement

732
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,240
itself on the distribution of variants

733
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,558
the power Spectrum um and this is a

734
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,960
simple idealized drawing where you can

735
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,519
imagine some white noise input being

736
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,519
filtered through the proxy the tree ring

737
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,880
width being a function both of annual

738
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,519
moisture availability but

739
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,799
also previous years's growth inc2 soil

740
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,278
moisture a host of other factors that

741
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:51,200
are going to smooth out those high

742
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,679
frequency fluctuations and emphasize the

743
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,679
longer time

744
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,200
scales and the simplest model that

745
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,759
probably can come up with one can come

746
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,399
up with to try and quantify this effect

747
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,359
is this first order Auto regressive

748
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,959
process so you've just got your proxy at

749
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:15,240
time T some autocorrelation coefficient

750
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,278
and noise and we can investigate this

751
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,200
using the polymer drought severity index

752
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,759
which has a prescribed autocorrelation

753
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,038
coefficient of

754
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,200
0.897 uh from one month to the next so

755
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:29,359
it's not 0. n it is

756
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,759
0.897 from one month to the next month

757
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,798
and we can use that to calculate an

758
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:36,599
analytical power spectrum and do Monte

759
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:40,359
Carlo simulations of pdsi to get at you

760
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,398
know the range of of amplitudes that one

761
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,119
could predict on these longer time

762
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,599
scales solely from

763
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,158
autocorrelation and a white noise

764
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,240
background so if there's no other show

765
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,278
in town in the southwest besides weather

766
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,079
and auto correlation this is the power

767
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:57,480
Spectrum we predict analytically in this

768
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,759
black line and with Monte Carlo

769
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,240
realizations in the gray

770
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,599
shading it's a very nice Benchmark then

771
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,759
against which we can compare our

772
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,879
collection of hydroclimate proxies the

773
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,359
style of hyers and Curry and

774
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,000
hydroclimate proxies now in the

775
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,199
southwest so up here we've got in the

776
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,440
colored

777
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,600
lines different tree ring

778
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,519
reconstructions reconstructions all of

779
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,119
them uh all available reconstructions of

780
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,960
all streamflow variables in red all

781
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,839
precipitation reconstructions in purple

782
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,558
and then this is a really

783
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,959
pristine

784
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,839
or really high quality very carefully

785
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,519
constructed data set that Connie

786
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,918
Woodhouse and her con colleagues put

787
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:46,120
together from the five needle Pines in

788
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:49,038
the southwest and it was designed to

789
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:52,439
have the best chance of preserving those

790
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:54,679
low frequency time skills by only using

791
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,759
long segments so at the stage where

792
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,480
you're building a chronology they threw

793
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,158
out anything that was shorter like 200

794
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,679
years or 250 years so so right off the

795
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,240
bat you've got a good chance of having

796
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,600
long segments which are required because

797
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,200
of how the TR the D trending is applied

798
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,398
you need long segments you already got

799
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,000
long segments and then they also

800
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,678
additionally apply very conservative D

801
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,200
trending so trying to leave in as much

802
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,720
of that low frequency variability as

803
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,519
possible while still removing the

804
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,600
non-climate

805
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,558
factors the other archives on here are

806
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,918
non-re ring so the symbols are non- tree

807
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:31,480
ring proxies from lakes and caves and

808
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,799
then the gry line is their

809
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,159
average and there's some things that are

810
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:36,839
a little surprising and some things that

811
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,399
aren't very surprising this diagram to

812
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:42,398
me one is that for the most part the

813
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,959
tree ring records on these is about a

814
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,439
decade a century Millennium most of the

815
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,798
treeing reconstructions other than this

816
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,000
five needle Pine very pristine data set

817
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:56,278
are well within the confidence

818
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,599
limits it's a really significant result

819
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:58,880
and a really problematic one for lots of

820
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,558
reasons

821
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,600
it means that for most of the streamflow

822
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,678
reconstructions that we have the

823
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,918
emergence of Mega droughts of decadal

824
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,960
droughts at least is not outside of what

825
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:12,440
you would expect from stochastic forcing

826
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,200
plus a little autocorrelation in a bunch

827
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,679
of time right you're right in the middle

828
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,600
there but you have these other proxies

829
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,960
pointing at a different story and we

830
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,119
know that there's some DET trending

831
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,120
applied to these when the variant

832
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,638
dropping down here is maybe indicative

833
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,079
of that that the the trending itself is

834
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:30,479
removing variant in these long time

835
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,079
scales from these other reconstructions

836
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,639
whereas in the

837
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,000
noning

838
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:38,839
reconstructions non triing proxies

839
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,038
there's no DET trending and they're all

840
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:44,079
giving you this kind of red shape that's

841
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,359
aligned fairly well with the five nle

842
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,240
Pline database so I think the weight of

843
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:49,759
evidence from this diagram is towards

844
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,038
rejecting the null hypothesis in other

845
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,079
words it's not that the only show in

846
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,319
town is autocorrelation stochastic

847
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,278
forcing in a bunch of time there's

848
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,678
something more interesting happening on

849
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,038
these longer time scales driving the low

850
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,038
frequency

851
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:07,879
variability we reject the null

852
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,918
hypothesis with more data we probably

853
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,720
will have to revisit this whole Paradigm

854
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,120
but for now it doesn't seem like we have

855
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,200
um any reason to

856
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,079
think that the variance out here in

857
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,360
these proxies is driven by something

858
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,359
other than climate

859
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:31,079
processes so the one do this purely from

860
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:33,319
statistics now we've got different noise

861
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,038
models that we could apply based on the

862
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:38,038
autocorrelation or low frequency

863
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,240
behavior of of of the Paleo climate

864
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:42,200
archives we have try to reproduce their

865
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,159
variations Through Time statistically

866
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,919
and come up with an assessment of

867
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,919
prolong drought Mega drought

868
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,439
likelihood and that's what we did in one

869
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,879
of these papers where we just looked at

870
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,880
White Noise Air1 and then a power law

871
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,120
distribution in frequency power law

872
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,440
bution to try and get at this long long

873
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,638
time scale High amplitude tail in the

874
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,360
power

875
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:08,838
Spectrum what's really cool I think

876
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,480
about this figure is that so we the way

877
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,838
that we we constructed our methods you

878
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,480
can compare in time the different types

879
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,639
of noise models and on short time

880
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,398
Horizons of 50 years it almost makes no

881
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,760
difference you're getting the same kinds

882
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:24,279
of St and they all the same exact

883
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,240
variance zero mean on longer time scales

884
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,200
when you were only looking at the

885
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,398
interannual fluctuations you'd still I

886
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,039
mean even if I had wasn't using gray

887
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,719
shading here to save money and journal

888
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,878
of climate publication

889
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,158
charges um which are sizable even if I

890
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:38,960
wasn't you'd still be hard pressed to

891
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,960
tell the differences but then when you

892
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,720
smooth you look only for the low

893
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,878
frequency components the power law

894
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,918
distribution has this persistence that

895
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:49,639
really pops out and so you stay away

896
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,039
from the mean both above and below the

897
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,159
mean for longer when you're looking at

898
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,918
the power law distribution which is what

899
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,919
you'd expect but that could be important

900
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:00,400
for trying to characterize the risk of

901
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,799
megad and indeed it matters quite a bit

902
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,039
so these are just different PDFs

903
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,200
different ways of looking at these Monte

904
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,559
Carlo simulations to characterize the

905
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:11,319
risk number of years spent in a decal

906
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,920
drought decal drought risk as a fraction

907
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,720
of all 50-year periods experiencing one

908
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,559
of these events and multi decadal Mega

909
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,078
drought risk it really matters out here

910
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,639
when you get out to the multi- decadal

911
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,400
mega drought

912
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,239
risk if the system were fundamentally

913
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,920
white in nature if it was a white noise

914
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,239
process generating droughts you would

915
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,680
have

916
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:34,719
only like a less than one I think it's

917
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,759
like0 four or. 3% of all 50-year periods

918
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,879
actually had one of these 50y year or

919
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:43,280
35y year multi-d Mega very very rare ar1

920
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,039
they become a little more common and

921
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,160
power law you can't quite ignore them

922
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,719
15% of all 50-year chunks had one of

923
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,719
these 35y year megga DRS in them so this

924
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,118
is a purely statistical you know

925
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,239
probabilistic approach to the problem

926
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,318
and it gives you an answer actually

927
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:02,000
these two are more or less both of them

928
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:04,239
consistent with the Paleo climate

929
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,838
estimates of one to two decal droughts

930
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,118
per century and one to two multi- deal

931
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:10,599
Mega droughts per Millennium there's a

932
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,920
consistency there so then the final

933
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,318
thing that we looked at that we

934
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,358
interested in using to come back to this

935
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:21,318
question of How likely are Mega droughts

936
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,318
in the future are Global Climate models

937
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:26,559
not only are they able to be run for

938
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,039
hundreds of years in Standalone mode

939
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,358
with boundary conditions set to

940
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,519
pre-industrial levels which could give

941
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,880
you a nice Benchmark in and of itself

942
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,039
they also are of course being used to

943
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,838
assess and plan for climate change

944
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,039
occurring from human activities this

945
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:43,679
Century they're the crystal ball into

946
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,079
the future and we don't think we have no

947
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,919
reason to think that the statistics of

948
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,920
the past whether these are inferred from

949
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,800
payload climate archives or statistical

950
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
models Monte Carlo methods alone we have

951
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,000
no reason to think that those should be

952
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,319
stationary into the future when we're

953
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,760
changing climate and if we're changing

954
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:03,920
clate very significantly there's there's

955
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,800
very very little reason to expect those

956
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,200
ratios of 1 to two percent for the decal

957
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,839
drought and one to two per Millennium

958
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:11,318
for the multi- decal Mega drought to

959
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,799
hold up into the future so that's why we

960
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:15,279
need to look at the gcms it's a

961
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,599
requirement for trying to get it right

962
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,599
for this

963
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,400
Century I think everyone's pretty

964
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,680
familiar with the idea of a GCM a global

965
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,800
climate model what I will what I will

966
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:31,358
say about them is that uh when I was at

967
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,200
enar I think in my second year there the

968
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,440
chief software engineer for one of the

969
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,598
groups I was working with was suddenly

970
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,599
suddenly put in his uh two weeks notice

971
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:45,079
and was

972
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,079
gone it's gone he was recruited by

973
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:49,759
Dreamworks became an

974
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,960
imagineer so why did DreamWorks want a

975
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,039
software engineer from enar well

976
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,760
DreamWorks is very interested in

977
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,719
computation fluid dynamics because when

978
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,200
Shrek sails off into the ocean they want

979
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,559
thean to look realistic and doing it in

980
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,239
a way that looks realistic means solving

981
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,559
the equations of fluid flow numerically

982
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,159
in a plausible way that our own

983
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,239
intuition will tell us looks good so

984
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,399
that's why people like the chief

985
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,759
software engineer the group I was

986
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,079
working gets recruited by places like

987
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,760
DreamWorks also I think they pulled up a

988
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,839
dump truck of money and told them to get

989
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,720
in I think that was part of why he

990
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:29,400
disappeared so quickly um so it's the

991
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:32,679
same basic set of equations that one

992
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,800
uses for video games for Pixar for

993
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:36,199
DreamWorks solved differently of course

994
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,280
in three dimensions on a grid across

995
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:39,439
multiple layers in the ocean the

996
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,880
atmosphere and it does all the exchanges

997
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,079
of heat and energy and mass that are

998
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,240
important for the whole climate

999
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,200
system these are results from just one

1000
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,719
model running out into the future sure

1001
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,598
you've seen these kinds of diagrams

1002
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:53,919
before where you've got the different

1003
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,440
rcps representative concentration

1004
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,519
Pathways down here on the low end you

1005
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,559
know optimistically if we avoid the

1006
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:02,679
worst you know effects of of climate

1007
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,318
change we're down here on the low end if

1008
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:07,480
we just burn baby burn we're going to

1009
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:10,719
end up on the RCP 8.5 actually if you

1010
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,240
look recently at the most the most

1011
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,719
upto-date estimates that I could find on

1012
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,598
what we're actually doing compared to

1013
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:20,000
the rcps people seen this we're we're

1014
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,559
slightly just a little bit above the

1015
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,838
worst case scenario envisioned in 200

1016
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,279
what7 um

1017
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:30,400
so so we're we're up here

1018
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,200
somewhere bottom line is higher the

1019
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,119
number of the RCP the more warming we

1020
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:38,480
expect because there's more radiative

1021
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,000
forcing and this is a

1022
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,119
very I I don't want to go into a lot of

1023
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,920
model bashing I me I love climate models

1024
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,680
but there are some serious limitations

1025
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,400
that do need to be acknowledged um

1026
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,199
particularly as they pertain to the

1027
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,000
problem of of Mega systematic biases

1028
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,519
very small Ensemble sizes uh you know we

1029
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,920
assume that because they're based in

1030
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:05,440
physics we can get away with smaller

1031
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,079
Ensemble sizes um you don't need a

1032
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,119
thousand or 10,000 or 100,00

1033
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,440
realizations of a GCM if it's doing

1034
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,240
something dynamically realistic in the

1035
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,679
in the flow of the fluid itself but the

1036
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,118
emble sizes are still very small and the

1037
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,559
natural variability is substantial one

1038
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,800
of the systematic biases that could be

1039
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,519
particularly relevant for megad drout is

1040
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,880
this one they are often times too wet in

1041
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,039
a lot of places um in the Northern

1042
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,358
Hemisphere and especially in North

1043
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,279
America and even globally this is the

1044
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,159
total amount of precipitation in the

1045
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,960
models

1046
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,440
occurring just as a as an average in

1047
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,760
millimeters per day and this is gpcp so

1048
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,079
this is the observations down here at

1049
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,480
the bottom most of the models are a

1050
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,800
little too

1051
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,800
wet it's a

1052
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,680
consideration another one that we

1053
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:52,039
published on a couple years ago a few

1054
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:54,960
years ago

1055
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,880
now they have a distribution of Varian

1056
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,559
is related to what I was telling you

1057
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:02,559
about ccsm3 the old version of the encar

1058
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:04,480
model they are systematically too high

1059
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,838
frequency they're pushing inter anual

1060
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,760
variance

1061
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:11,440
around very high

1062
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,880
amplitudes and that relates largely to

1063
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,318
the tropical Pacific they fluctuate

1064
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,280
between an Alin and linia state not only

1065
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,480
too quickly but also very energetically

1066
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,960
when you compare the precipitation

1067
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,318
Spectra with power Spectrum

1068
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,720
precipitation from the models to the

1069
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,838
observations it really looks like it's a

1070
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:31,919
big difference you know factor of 5 to

1071
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,920
10 in some cases on the long

1072
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,879
scales but even with those

1073
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,318
considerations and a couple more that

1074
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,039
I'll list in a second here we win in we

1075
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,000
dove in head first and looked at these

1076
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,880
uh very Cutting Edge this is very this

1077
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,239
is still very Cutting Edge new area of

1078
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,480
paleoclimate simulation historically

1079
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,000
paleo climate simulations were done for

1080
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,639
say the mid Hall scene 6,000 years ago

1081
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,960
or the last glacial maximum where you're

1082
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:02,838
really just interested in the mean

1083
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,639
climate you get from a fixed set of

1084
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:06,400
boundary conditions the last Millennium

1085
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:07,799
trying to simulate decal and multi- deal

1086
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,480
and multicentury variability over the

1087
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,880
last Millennium requires a whole

1088
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,880
different approach because you actually

1089
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,119
care about the time

1090
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,318
Evolution right it's not a fixed you

1091
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,240
know ice sheets here

1092
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,639
and Earth's orbit looks like this it's a

1093
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,439
it's a Time evolving forcing so you've

1094
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:27,679
got volcanic aerosols to worry about big

1095
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,400
eruptions from the past solar

1096
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,078
variability Sunspot Cycles related to

1097
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,400
solar output total solar output and of

1098
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,200
course the gradual changes in the mean

1099
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,200
ofage forcing the shape of the Earth's

1100
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,199
orbit it's tilt in

1101
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,280
particular when you put them all

1102
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,719
together these are our primary tool so

1103
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,200
it's all it's the best we've got put

1104
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,358
them all together force the model and

1105
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,439
just to give you a sense here's an

1106
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:54,799
animation for what it looks like this is

1107
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,559
going to be

1108
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,839
smoothed sea surface temperature so low

1109
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,680
pass filter cadal C surface temperature

1110
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:03,960
up here at the top is the total forcing

1111
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:06,039
at the top of the

1112
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,519
atmosphere

1113
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:12,639
and the map is C surface temperature

1114
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,358
after removing all the high frequency

1115
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,078
variability you can start to see some of

1116
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:19,000
these volcanic events showing

1117
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,599
up I'm GNA I'm going to fast forward

1118
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,880
this a little bit we can get to the good

1119
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,519
stuff this big

1120
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,519
1248 12 excuse me 1250 58

1121
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,079
eruption all right wait for it it's

1122
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:41,358
coming there's

1123
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,359
one there's

1124
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,679
another and you can already I me this is

1125
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,838
decayed ripped out the interannual

1126
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,799
variability the frequency is of the

1127
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,679
forcing is very abrupt it's like a Delta

1128
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,079
function it's very abrupt forcing but

1129
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,318
you're seeing it propagate out in these

1130
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,839
longer time scales you just happen to

1131
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,279
have this centry here where there's

1132
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,639
volcanic activity and one very

1133
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,640
significant this is like 20 this scales

1134
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:10,118
to like 25 times the pin tubo 1993 event

1135
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,358
it's a very significant volcanic

1136
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,559
eruption just to remind you the power

1137
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,558
spectrum of

1138
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,760
the proxies looked more or less like

1139
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:20,960
looked like this in the slide that I

1140
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,880
showed we're going to make the same

1141
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,079
calculations

1142
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,079
from the models

1143
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,240
this is all of them all the last

1144
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,679
Millennium simulations pre-industrial

1145
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,279
these are unforced but about a thousand

1146
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:36,838
years long last Millennium simulations

1147
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,640
there's that reference line from the

1148
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:40,480
from the

1149
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:42,879
proxies um L mum simulations only

1150
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,679
through 1850 so pre-industrial portion

1151
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,599
of the last Millennium simulations and

1152
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,598
then just the 20th century there's

1153
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,400
there's no if that's interesting

1154
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,640
variability right it's above what you

1155
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,880
expect from the null hypothesis there's

1156
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,118
not a model out there today that's

1157
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,000
generating that level of low frequency

1158
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,039
variability so if it's dynamically

1159
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,960
driven it's being inter it's being

1160
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:05,639
generated by processes that are maybe

1161
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,838
not very well resolved by the models on

1162
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,118
the other hand if it's a forced response

1163
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:09,318
to the models which is very plausible

1164
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,240
considering how much of an impact

1165
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:13,558
explosive volcanism seems to have it's

1166
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:17,439
still not showing up in there and that

1167
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,440
could be important for understanding of

1168
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,159
megad and then you got the small

1169
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,079
Ensemble size I want to come back to

1170
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:26,480
this say this is your you run four

1171
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,960
simulations with a model ccm3 you run

1172
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,960
four simul

1173
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:34,039
you get this distribution of some

1174
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,679
variable but truth looks more like this

1175
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:39,119
well that's a problem need to be able to

1176
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,239
factor that in you can see this in the

1177
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,680
terms of Mega say you got some shift in

1178
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,399
the mean and then you've got two

1179
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,719
realizations of a model in the first one

1180
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,480
there's a mega Dr in the second one

1181
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,719
there isn't the mean is the same the

1182
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,280
Varian is being drawn from the same

1183
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:54,318
shifted mean but you only have two

1184
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,400
realizations so does that mean the

1185
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,519
probability is 50% no it means you've

1186
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,280
under sampled

1187
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:03,639
the full PDF of plausible future

1188
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,000
clim it's a big problem we need to think

1189
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:08,159
seriously

1190
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,358
about and this last one I'm not going to

1191
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,318
dwell on very much but it's potentially

1192
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:14,358
a factor that we haven't accounted for

1193
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:18,159
which is that code has been shared

1194
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:21,400
between Cent between centers and that

1195
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:23,920
can have an impact on the macro scale

1196
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,680
behavior of the model so not necessarily

1197
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,200
truly independent because they have

1198
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,759
software components that can generate

1199
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,199
emergent processes that are similar

1200
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,200
structural

1201
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,599
similarities our workaround for all

1202
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,519
these

1203
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,440
considerations we focus on changes

1204
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,280
relative to the 20th century that are in

1205
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,159
model relative changes try to use Monte

1206
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,680
Carlo methods to fill out the

1207
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,239
PDF and ongoing work haven't really

1208
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,598
finished is trying to identify clusters

1209
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,879
of similar models and look at the risks

1210
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,838
within

1211
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,039
clusters so we can come back to this

1212
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:59,119
question How likely look at the GCM

1213
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:02,838
world How likely are these megad

1214
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,838
DRS and put it all

1215
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,559
together three different forcings RCP

1216
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:10,880
2.6 4.5

1217
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,160
8.5 making white noise assumptions about

1218
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,119
the underlying statistics of

1219
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:18,039
precipitation you get this increase in

1220
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,960
Risk that's primarily reflective of the

1221
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:22,558
Southwest getting

1222
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,159
drier coming down here we're using

1223
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,440
different noise models to emulate the

1224
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:30,159
statistics of the model of the gcms

1225
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,280
themselves and again there's this

1226
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,639
increase because when you saw before use

1227
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,400
power law as your your generating

1228
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:41,159
process your tendency to persist away

1229
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:44,039
from the mean is greater and then the

1230
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,799
combined High forcing with a assumption

1231
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:47,400
about power law distribution in the

1232
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,039
power in the frequency spectrum gives

1233
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,880
you the highest estimates of risk this

1234
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,558
is only applied to

1235
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,960
precipitation that's decadal so 10 year

1236
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,480
so making events like the uh the 19

1237
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,800
1950s drought in the southwest 1930s

1238
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,159
Dust Bowl looked like there's you know

1239
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,800
80%

1240
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,480
90% of the realizations seeing events

1241
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,359
like that and then multi- deal Mega

1242
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,240
drought so this is really the take-home

1243
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,159
from precipitation only doesn't even

1244
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:16,159
factor in the temperature

1245
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,679
effects you've

1246
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,519
got 35y year

1247
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:30,440
average giving you conditions on in the

1248
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:32,440
models that are as dry or D than the

1249
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,318
1930s we're emulating this with

1250
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,720
different noise models but in all cases

1251
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:42,639
I would call this a very non-negligible

1252
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:44,719
level of risk 30 40 50% chance that

1253
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:47,078
we're going to be seeing a background

1254
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,799
shift waiting the dice towards making

1255
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:51,359
these events which historically in the

1256
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,960
payo climate view of the world have only

1257
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:57,400
occurred one or two times per Millennium

1258
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,599
but this Century because of this shifted

1259
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,480
Baseline they're much more

1260
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,640
probable I'm going to finish here

1261
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,880
because I need to go teach a class and

1262
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:10,440
this isn't just a us we're not

1263
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,440
alone you look globally and do the same

1264
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,318
types of calculations the US is just one

1265
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,159
pocket of the world that looks likely to

1266
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,000
be exposed to this very high level of

1267
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,598
risk we turn the crank again factoring

1268
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,599
in temperature and it looked way worse

1269
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,119
for most of these areas because in dry

1270
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,640
areas when it's hot the the demand for

1271
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,200
moisture goes up and it goes up with

1272
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,199
temperature very very

1273
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,200
dramatically you can see that for the

1274
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,078
Southwest thousand years in the central

1275
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,598
PL to reconstructed pdsi in the future

1276
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,920
thousand years of reconstructed pdsi in

1277
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,920
the southwest and then the

1278
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:51,439
future and we're really getting away

1279
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,760
from Mega drought because we're talking

1280
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,358
about climate change now we're talking

1281
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,400
about climate change at the end of the

1282
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,598
century and the you know I would say the

1283
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,440
the number

1284
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,920
one feedback that we got from

1285
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,519
stakeholders Water Resource managers

1286
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,200
after these papers were published was

1287
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,798
that's great you know I don't but I I

1288
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:14,318
can't use information about

1289
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:16,679
2075 I can't deal with 2050 to 2100

1290
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,159
being your reference point what can we

1291
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:21,039
do what's actionable now and so I've

1292
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:23,000
really shifted my my research Focus away

1293
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:25,759
from these climate change time Horizons

1294
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,119
down towards decal and seasonal time

1295
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,839
Horizons because even as Bleak as this

1296
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,358
picture you'll see this in the next this

1297
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:32,358
animation

1298
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:44,159
looks this is Brown is going to be

1299
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,160
dry this is the future Brown is

1300
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:52,279
dry this is if we just keep on burning

1301
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,400
the rate we're burning or higher that's

1302
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,359
the future we have and even as Bleak as

1303
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,400
it looks it's not it's not actionable

1304
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:01,960
we want to be able to see things

1305
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,760
unfolding closer to real time as they

1306
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,920
happen so that's what we're focus on now

1307
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,319
we're focusing on seasonal prediction

1308
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,358
and decal prediction and trying to get

1309
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:11,440
not at this long time scale not at the

1310
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,519
low frequency end but really switching

1311
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,159
several orders of magnitude down towards

1312
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,759
the higher frequency into the power

1313
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:20,679
Spectrum so I'll end there because I got

1314
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,680
to go pretty soon here thank

1315
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:33,318
you the the drought that occurred in New

1316
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:35,640
York City yes so that that's DEC

1317
00:51:33,318 --> 00:51:38,079
and

1318
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,358
we yeah it's probably I mean without

1319
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,559
climate change it would have a chance of

1320
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,199
probably one or two times per Century

1321
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:44,839
now it looks like it's been getting W

1322
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:48,399
right so we don't know we haven't

1323
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:50,039
assessed the Northeast yet okay um I use

1324
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,480
the story of that drought because my my

1325
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,119
mother-in-law lived in the 60 lived in

1326
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,880
in New York City during the 60s and she

1327
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,480
she remembers the signs and the sub way

1328
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,640
that said save water shower with a

1329
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,440
friend so that's there you go lucky

1330
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,639
people of the internet I said it I'm on

1331
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,400
camera saying

1332
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:11,039
it yes just a quick question are you

1333
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,960
focusing mainly in the United States or

1334
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:17,000
are you looking at droughts in Africa uh

1335
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,199
yeah we want to Branch out globally I

1336
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,440
mean I think this is one of these cool

1337
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:23,639
things about being a langr university is

1338
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,159
that the the methods apply wherever we

1339
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:26,598
want them to essentially you know and if

1340
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,719
you have great paleo climate records you

1341
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,000
can do a better job but even if you

1342
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,919
don't these preliminary estimates are

1343
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,318
probably actionable in some cases for

1344
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,720
long time scales of Water Resource

1345
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,759
Management so for building dams or

1346
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:39,959
looking at strategic aquafer reserves

1347
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,960
that kind of thing the

1348
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,358
same uh I think that's the idea yeah I

1349
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:50,078
mean ultimately to to scale it out more

1350
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,759
shortterm more actionable and scaled out

1351
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,039
to other places that use water which is

1352
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,040
you know everywhere

1353
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:06,079
this has been a production of Cornell

1354
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,079
University on the web at cornell.edu
