1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,759
University so once again thank you for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,030
the invitation and I'll talk to you

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,759
about secretory structures not everyone

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,710
may have heard about those but I hope to

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,219
convince them you that they are actually

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,250
important and diversity is really a

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:26,129
themed it's an opportunity bits but it's

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,740
also a curse so sometimes we're spread

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,358
too thinly and you will probably

11
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:37,619
recognize that as well

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:40,679
so you see how do we go these these okay

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:44,429
so I want to put out a hypothesis this

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,640
is not entirely proven and tested but I

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,058
think it's an interesting one to start

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,410
for a talk

17
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,209
chemical diversity of metabolites

18
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,238
correlates with the availability of

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,070
suitable storage so in a way when you

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,009
look at plants they make hundreds of

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,198
thousands of different metabolites

22
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:04,890
across the the different species in

23
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,259
general humans can't do that and one of

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,319
the reasons is because plants I think

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,570
have evolved these secretory structures

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,609
where they can use them as a playground

27
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,149
for testing out new biochemistry you

28
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,560
make something new it's not immediately

29
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,040
detrimental to growth because you can

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,439
sequester it and that's so that's a key

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,030
aspect of this so that's the hypothesis

32
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,478
that I'll go by now the other

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,618
possibility obviously is to volatilize

34
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,469
metabolites if you can get rid of them

35
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,900
by moving them into the atmosphere but

36
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:41,009
that's not something we'll focus on

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,380
today so you can look at the evolution

38
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,569
of land plants in various different ways

39
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,429
you can look at the fossil record you

40
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,368
can look at extant plants and try to

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,640
make inferences as to what things may

42
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:56,239
have looked like a long time ago you can

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,769
look at biomarker metabolites that are

44
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,390
indicative of certain metabolic

45
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:05,750
capabilities you can look at structure

46
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,788
structures that exist on plants today

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:12,620
and when you do that you notice that

48
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,739
there are various different structures

49
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,129
there

50
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,330
have evolved over time one important one

51
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:22,710
was the the evolution of oil bodies so

52
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,590
if you look at the nonvascular plants

53
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,870
you have foreign words you have mosses

54
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,000
they're not very rich in chemistry but

55
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,650
the liver words an incredibly rich and

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,379
they have oil bodies they are

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,490
intracellular organelles that holds

58
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,069
lipophilic metabolites and you know at

59
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,020
least from the correlative evidence that

60
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,539
that might be one of the reasons why

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,580
they can generate this diversity of

62
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:52,620
structures because they can sequester

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:56,880
them then what people have also boy this

64
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,009
is difficult but people have also shown

65
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,349
is that there are Amber's that people

66
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,969
have recovered from more than 300

67
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,000
million that have been dated back to

68
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:09,419
more than 300 million years ago so those

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,400
are fossilized remains of what very

70
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,500
likely were resin ducts or resin

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,069
blisters you still find them in the

72
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,159
extant

73
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:20,219
conifers today and again it's an

74
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,789
important storage structure then you

75
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:27,479
will find glandular trichomes now these

76
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:30,979
were the earliest ones were found at a

77
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,359
similar time dated back to to the

78
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:36,299
transition of the Carboniferous to the

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,940
Permian period and it was seed ferns

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,340
that had these glandular trichomes with

81
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,310
hooks on top so if an insect would walk

82
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,560
over this the surface it would catch

83
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,810
this hook and that would then release

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,300
volatiles very likely that were stored

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,550
in those granular trichomes now they're

86
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,520
they're very common in the angiosperms

87
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,790
which evolved much later but they were

88
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,730
also it looks like present in in some of

89
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:05,939
the plants that were present on earth

90
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:09,119
much earlier than that so you will find

91
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,819
these various different themes when it

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,360
comes to these secretory structures I

93
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:18,209
want to make a pitch very briefly about

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,220
studying these these metabolites that

95
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,910
accumulate in these specialized

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,040
structures and that is that this is not

97
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,600
what people would generally consider as

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,400
metabolomics it's one of

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,310
buzzwords that people like to use these

100
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,199
days because there are lots of

101
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,300
considerations that have to go into your

102
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,180
experimental design I just wanted to go

103
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,829
over this very very briefly so if you if

104
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,889
you're looking at votes go back if

105
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:48,359
you're looking at for volatiles in some

106
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,519
cases you can collect them from the

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,780
headspace but you have to be equipped to

108
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:57,149
do so you can do a solvent extraction

109
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:59,579
and what's become very populous tissue

110
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:01,560
imaging and I'll show you a few pictures

111
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,479
of what that looks like and what you can

112
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,629
learn from those kinds of technologies

113
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,819
you can before you analyze you can

114
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,129
pre-process your samples if you're only

115
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,899
interested in a subset of metabolites

116
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,540
you can absorb them to certain types of

117
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,269
materials as volatize you can do solid

118
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,170
phase extraction that's a fairly common

119
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:25,079
method for pretreatment then in most

120
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,629
cases you want to separate them you have

121
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,479
thousands of different metabolites in a

122
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,670
in an extract and if you they all go

123
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,710
into your detector at the same time you

124
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,830
might overwhelm that detector so a

125
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:40,589
chromatographic separation is desirable

126
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,939
you can use stationary phases as they

127
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:45,179
call the different columns and have

128
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:48,329
different Lera T's so in that case you

129
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,180
retain the analytes differentially that

130
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:53,250
separates them something that we do a

131
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,870
lot because we work with volatiles that

132
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,879
are used in the fragrance and flavor

133
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,800
industries we do a lot of Carlow

134
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,639
separations

135
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,090
- limonene smells like turpentine almost

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,389
plus limonene smells like citrus so we

137
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:13,199
are able to differentiate enantiomers

138
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:16,919
and so are animals so it's very

139
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,219
important to focus on on those chiral

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,449
separations to ensure that you you know

141
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,900
which of the eyes of ours you're looking

142
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:27,209
at and then for larger scale separations

143
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,699
we do have typical large columns that

144
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:32,149
you've seen in chemistry labs then you

145
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,879
have different ways in which you can

146
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:37,739
detect metabolites mass spectrometry is

147
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,500
certainly one important one these days

148
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,430
style rate also gives you information

149
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,060
about

150
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,280
that allows you to infer to structure

151
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,800
flame ionization detector is something

152
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,659
that you do with GC but it's it's very

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,460
nice for routine screening it

154
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,000
essentially just burns carbon gives you

155
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:59,489
a signal but it's non selective which is

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,629
an advantage then you can characterize

157
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,579
your analytes by fragmenting them and

158
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,589
there are certain rules in chemistry

159
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,959
that allow you to infrastructure from

160
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:11,639
these fragments you can do the same with

161
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,019
nuclear magnetic magnetic resonance

162
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,719
which is even more informative toward

163
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,060
structural characterization and then you

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,670
you run in you still run into that major

165
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,670
problem of peak annotation so you have

166
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:30,689
lots of spectral features that are

167
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:34,140
reported by your instrument and then you

168
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:38,040
have to use databases to match those

169
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:40,110
with known spectra or as inspector of

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,870
known metabolites were you develop

171
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,810
technologies like garage and his knob do

172
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,000
where you're trying to come up with

173
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,579
rules that will allow you to use

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
theoretical databases essentially but

175
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:56,370
the take home message here is I review a

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,360
lot of papers and people oftentimes just

177
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:03,300
believe what the instrument tells them

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,509
and you can certainly can't do that so

179
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,569
just because your top library had is XY

180
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,310
and Z doesn't really know anything

181
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:14,550
oftentimes you really have to dig deeper

182
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,620
and do a better job with the annotation

183
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,980
and then what's also important is that

184
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,509
you're not just using one technology you

185
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,050
know you need to look at things from

186
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:26,189
various different angles separate

187
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,860
metabolites using various different

188
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:32,820
techniques and then also ideally use

189
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,970
different techniques for for detection

190
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:40,440
so just a little pitch here let's get

191
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:43,110
into some some biology so I talked about

192
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,080
these specialized cell types or

193
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,060
secretory structures I'll begin with a

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,700
Chinese medicinal plants that we've

195
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,689
worked with the Thunder God vine great

196
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,360
name of course and it's used in

197
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,200
traditional

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,230
médecins throughout Southeast Asia since

199
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,920
the 15th century it's usually the roots

200
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,570
that people harvest and obviously that's

201
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,329
non-sustainable once you kill the root

202
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,680
you kill the plant so you have to regrow

203
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,840
these plants they have to be at a

204
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,809
certain age before you can harvest them

205
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,550
and you can see you saw those roots

206
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,739
before there they were pretty fixed so

207
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,709
those are fantastic seven to eight years

208
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,370
old so it's a fairly slow cycle in which

209
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,230
you grow them the the drug candidate

210
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,360
that has been pushed the furthest is

211
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,250
called addis triptolide which is a

212
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,100
diterpene i'll show you a structure in

213
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,539
just a minute and they've been clinical

214
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,610
trials that have been reasonably

215
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,769
successful but there is a sourcing

216
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,409
problem because you're extracting from

217
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:50,360
these roots and the yields are extremely

218
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:55,620
low the reason is because the dry weight

219
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,720
content of those diet opioids is 0.008

220
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,909
percent of the dry mouth so you can

221
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,800
imagine you're you're going through

222
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:05,279
enormous amounts of tissue before you

223
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,529
get anything useful now there there is

224
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,049
some preclinical data for some of the

225
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:12,149
trite repeats as well and I'll briefly

226
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:16,649
mention some other work that we've done

227
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:18,360
on those as well but what's important is

228
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,340
that the traditional methods that people

229
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,430
have been using are great for

230
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,860
preliminary data but it's very difficult

231
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:28,729
to do this and if at is clinical scale

232
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,350
and then at a commercial scale it's

233
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,539
somewhat similar to the situation with

234
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,340
diet and with taxall which some of you

235
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,829
might be aware of it's something that is

236
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,470
now produced in plant cell cultures so

237
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,090
just a fish etic was a postdoc you know

238
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,830
works in the cannabis industry like

239
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,570
almost all the students and postdocs

240
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,660
that come out of my lab these days

241
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,870
because those states that have legalized

242
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:54,719
cannabis now require the measurement of

243
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,399
terpenes and while everyone has focused

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
on the cannabinoids no one knows how to

245
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,079
analyze terpenes so it's hard for me to

246
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,079
get students to actually finish

247
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:17,009
which is good for them I won't but thank

248
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,470
you

249
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:24,198
so anyways there's this on the left side

250
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,839
here that is applied a very highly

251
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:32,338
functional eyes diterpene sinestro here

252
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,079
is a triterpene both accumulate in in

253
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,269
the roots to the highest level a

254
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,009
triploid you also find out swear but as

255
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:41,870
you can see this is a logarithmic scale

256
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:43,828
here so the gray are the Celestra

257
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,480
concentrations they're very very high

258
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:48,659
and then some of the different mood

259
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,050
types that you see here much higher than

260
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:53,669
what the the dieter beans so yes the

261
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:56,370
boss sometimes goes into the lap and

262
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,559
actually does stuff take you when he

263
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,959
thinks that no one else likes like

264
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,578
running larger columns and isolating the

265
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,319
tabloids and those kinds of things so

266
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:09,328
that i did this three years ago I think

267
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:13,890
over Christmas break I isolated some of

268
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:16,948
those Peaks and Diana and Vidya or Sri

269
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:20,009
as we call her who is a senior scientist

270
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:22,349
in the group did most of the downstream

271
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:27,708
analysis or she ran them all the mass

272
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:30,990
spec she got at a mass spectra and we

273
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:33,419
developed a database for NMR spectra

274
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,959
that had been has been very very useful

275
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:39,958
for us in deep replicating extra so we

276
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,389
can very quickly identify which of the

277
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,208
peaks that we find in a chromatogram and

278
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:48,208
then where we have spectra have actually

279
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:52,169
been reported before and as you can see

280
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:54,328
I hope you can see that hope that there

281
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:57,269
are a number of these sesame terpene

282
00:12:54,328 --> 00:13:00,349
alkaloids a fairly complex structure

283
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:03,948
where in some cases they only differ by

284
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:09,329
positions of certain functional groups

285
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:11,159
or you have functional groups in

286
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:15,088
different locations and that is very

287
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:18,179
very difficult to resolve but even with

288
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:22,100
fairly crude extracts using this the

289
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:28,069
NMR database we were able to identify or

290
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:30,210
associate tentative annotations that

291
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,740
whittled it down to essentially a

292
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,089
structural class now to get full

293
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,709
spectral annotation you would have to do

294
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,240
two dimensional experiments and those

295
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:42,088
kinds of things so that's the next thing

296
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,129
that we want to try to integrate two

297
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,670
dimensional spectra into the database

298
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:50,549
and find a way to generate an algorithm

299
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:53,819
that that will capture that so anyways

300
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:56,490
the idea the point here is that these

301
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,240
databases allow us to go through

302
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,730
extracts much faster than before and

303
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,879
focus on the metabolites of interest and

304
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:09,149
well I'll talk about now the diterpene

305
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:14,000
so the dimethyl Celestra and the

306
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:16,649
Celestra that I showed before so we did

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,259
we did route imaging so in this case

308
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:23,519
it's it's a Mountie based platform you

309
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:26,309
have you have a cryo section sample you

310
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,929
have a laser that goes over that sample

311
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:31,259
the sample can be moved in a certain

312
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:33,239
pattern and essentially eventually you

313
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,429
will have covered the entire surface of

314
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,930
that sample on the other end then

315
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,819
there's a mass spectrometer so

316
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:40,679
essentially at every given time when

317
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,690
you've collected a sample and you know

318
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,849
what haven't you used to go across that

319
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,120
sample you get a mass spectrum on the

320
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,480
other end you can then analyze those

321
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,528
mass spectra and in in this particular

322
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,690
case it's a it's an instrument that also

323
00:14:55,528 --> 00:15:02,100
allows you to do separations in the gas

324
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,589
phase called ion mobility so molecules

325
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,570
are separated by shape because you can't

326
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,120
do chromatography that's very important

327
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,879
here because a lot of these are isobars

328
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,190
they have the same mass but the shape is

329
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,370
different so you can distinguish them

330
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:21,120
using iron mobility and as you can see

331
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:25,560
you have these try turbines all on the

332
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
outside where the cortex is whereas some

333
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,989
of these sesquiterpene alkaloids they

334
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,990
are

335
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:36,139
they are in the cortex of my my my bad

336
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,449
and these try Europeans are all in the

337
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,600
paradigm Durham the nice thing in this

338
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:43,758
case is that these trite or points of

339
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,769
interest there Quinn own methods so they

340
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,480
have a color they have chroma force in

341
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,240
there so we can actually see them and we

342
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,188
can kind of correlate what we see with

343
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,220
mass spectrometry with what we actually

344
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:58,879
see with the naked eye but the nice

345
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,579
thing here is you can as as the

346
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,370
technology improves you can get down to

347
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:06,109
almost cell your resolution with these

348
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,730
technologies and that is I think

349
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,278
something that in the future is gonna

350
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,709
make a big difference however and this

351
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,269
is the drawback it's not very sensitive

352
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,518
so for the diterpene err it's for

353
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:19,129
example we couldn't see them the

354
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,318
concentrations of those were too low to

355
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:23,360
be picked up using this approach they

356
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:26,058
were somewhere in the fairly high

357
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,579
background noise one of the things you

358
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:31,759
have to do is you have to coat these

359
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:34,938
samples with something that facilitates

360
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,769
the ionization usually in an ion source

361
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:39,049
you have a lot of energy to break up

362
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,000
molecules or ionize them with the

363
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:43,909
mountie you don't have that so yet you

364
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,980
need that matrix to help you with

365
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:48,198
transferring energy from the laser all

366
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,000
the way to the molecules but the matrix

367
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:53,479
gives you a lot of background so that

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,698
that's certainly one disadvantage so we

369
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,500
had to do well let's let's stay with

370
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:59,750
those triterpene there's one more slide

371
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,019
here so this is another cross-section in

372
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,709
this case of a fixed route and you can

373
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:09,500
see this this orangish color here now

374
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:13,038
because they've been fixed and you use

375
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,798
solvents to do that the the try

376
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:19,490
terpenoids don't stay exactly in the

377
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:21,788
location where they were before because

378
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,990
what we were asking is is it maybe

379
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:26,119
incorporation into membranes there are

380
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,058
steroids and membranes like venus at

381
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,939
astral would be a common one so the

382
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:34,369
question would be is there more of these

383
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,320
try terpenes found in the lair where we

384
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,898
actually find the accumulation based on

385
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,928
the mass spec results compared to to

386
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:44,899
other parts of muscle route and you see

387
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:47,420
that the outer route parts if you just

388
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,970
if you just section this out had a bit

389
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,640
more beta site at all which is a typical

390
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,259
membrane sterile and the inner parts of

391
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,450
the route but you have to keep in mind

392
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:58,670
that large parts of the inner route are

393
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,069
dead there's nothing going on so there

394
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,900
are no functional membranes and so on so

395
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:05,750
that the difference is really not that

396
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:09,440
large whereas for the Tri terpenoids the

397
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:13,250
difference is enormous from high

398
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,769
milligrams per gram quantities in the

399
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,440
Parador essentially nothing in here so

400
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:21,889
we we felt that the membrane was

401
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,549
apparently not the best candidate as as

402
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:27,740
a location so that got us thinking and

403
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:31,399
we did a number of different sustains

404
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:35,120
for different cell wall polymers one of

405
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:38,530
them is suberin and if you look at the

406
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:41,089
localization then the only one that

407
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:43,519
appears to correlate with the

408
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:46,579
localization of the trait opioids is

409
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,190
suberin it's a polymer and they are in

410
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:51,500
some cases people have actually reported

411
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,900
try to opioids to be incorporated but

412
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,089
these are soluble so we can just use an

413
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,480
organic solvent and they'll come out so

414
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:01,879
they're not polymerized into the polymer

415
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,390
they've they're just somewhat somewhere

416
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,820
out there you know in that general cell

417
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,360
wall area but we don't know exactly

418
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:13,849
where they are but at least the imaging

419
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,299
gave us some some good ideas of where to

420
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:18,949
look for so that brings us back to what

421
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:22,460
did we do without cytokines that we

422
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,860
couldn't profile we needed a different

423
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,539
system to work on where the

424
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:29,479
concentrations that we would work with

425
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:31,250
would be higher so Michael Hartman who

426
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,029
is now at the University of Bristol Dorf

427
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:38,079
was a postdoc amber Parrish is still a

428
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:40,069
technician in the lab they developed a

429
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,789
root culture system these are

430
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:47,029
adventitious roots cultures you can see

431
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:53,059
you can grow them in fairly large flasks

432
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:55,970
they grow to kilos weight balls of roots

433
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,950
within a couple of weeks so it's a very

434
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,679
nice system and

435
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,259
if you look at the profile here so those

436
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,210
are the roots and metabolites extracted

437
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:07,190
from there don't worry too much about

438
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,329
the various Tiff's metabolites their

439
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,360
trip the light is here so triptolide and

440
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:17,000
other diterpene are secreted into the

441
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,298
medium it doesn't get any better than

442
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,548
that

443
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:22,099
you don't even have to extract from the

444
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:25,129
roots it's just being placed where you

445
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:27,109
like it you replace the media anyways so

446
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,330
every two weeks you would take the media

447
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:32,778
extract them and those root cultures

448
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:34,609
would keep going and the concentrations

449
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:37,490
in there would actually be fairly high

450
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:39,079
so that allowed us to just look at the

451
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:43,819
profile of diterpene

452
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:46,699
in those root cultures again it was

453
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:49,579
using that same approach where we're

454
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:54,019
combining the analysis by mass

455
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:58,158
spectrometry ms/ms spectra and NMR to

456
00:20:54,019 --> 00:21:00,710
get IDs on those and if you look at the

457
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,370
structures you can place them into a

458
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,419
theoretical pathway so this is what we

459
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:08,359
could come up with

460
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:10,580
you have the universal precursor for

461
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,359
most of the dieter beans general journal

462
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:17,388
diphosphate you can make an intermediate

463
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:20,058
eventually the hydro avionic acid from

464
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:24,138
there your functionalized so you have to

465
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:27,710
lose this as co2 you have to

466
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:29,959
functionalize this position here that

467
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,788
would give you an additional

468
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,639
hydroxylation here would give you a trip

469
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:38,990
to a and B we did not detect trypsin in

470
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:40,638
be in our cell cultures but we detected

471
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,589
something that's very closely related

472
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:46,879
it's called tripped in an a so it's

473
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:50,629
methylated here you have a methyl you

474
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,850
can cyclize here that methyl ester but

475
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,980
you can also cyclize at this stage and

476
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:57,829
both of those metabolites we found in

477
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,929
our extracts and so on so in some cases

478
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:01,398
you can just look at the metabolites

479
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:03,048
that you're getting out of an extract

480
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:05,239
like this and you can come up with a

481
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:07,339
hypothesis of what the our synthetic

482
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,460
pathway looks like and then you can

483
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:14,449
start trying to work this out which

484
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,240
one of the PhD students FEMA you know we

485
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,080
did so she looked at the die terpene

486
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,349
synthases

487
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,839
there are quite a few of them I hope you

488
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:28,049
can see this so that it's a two-step

489
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,819
conversion here to a precursor a

490
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:31,889
different precursor and then you have

491
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:34,859
various different or in synthesis that

492
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:39,570
take it to those different structural

493
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:45,079
types and what was rewarding in this

494
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:47,359
case is that the end products of those

495
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,369
generated by those terpene synthases

496
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:53,579
have the structural course that people

497
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:56,279
have reported to occur in the genus trip

498
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,589
to rediem so there are natural products

499
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,599
these are Colerain dieter pians that are

500
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,759
not directly related to gibberellic acid

501
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,309
they have the same core structure but

502
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,990
they're actually natural products and

503
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,839
not hormones they don't have more

504
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,450
hormone functions and so those had been

505
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,970
characterized before and we essentially

506
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,730
identified the first genes and encoded

507
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,160
enzymes on on the path to those natural

508
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,620
products the a B 18

509
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,610
dieter beans those are the precursors of

510
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:30,359
triptolide and the other dieter beans in

511
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:32,609
trip to rediem so that was that was

512
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,949
significant process of progress there

513
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:37,769
there are now a number of other groups

514
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,740
that are working on this so because I

515
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:42,690
don't have a lot of funding for it

516
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,759
they're currently not taking this any

517
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,740
further

518
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:49,490
so that allows me to transition to a

519
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,230
different project a different type of

520
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:55,200
secretory structure now we'll be talking

521
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,670
about glandular trichomes and one of the

522
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,330
plants that we've worked with for many

523
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:02,960
years is peppermint and other mints and

524
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:05,519
the question was so we had made

525
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,549
significant progress in working out the

526
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,190
pathways that lead to the essential oils

527
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:14,119
that you're all familiar with but what

528
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,170
was not known is how they power made

529
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,759
metabolism because the glandular

530
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,789
trichomes and there are non

531
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,569
photosynthetic so what are these

532
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:24,899
structures they are epidermal outgrowths

533
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:27,329
you can

534
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:31,100
see them with the naked eye in cannabis

535
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:34,409
you can but in most plants you can't and

536
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:37,019
they they have they usually have a

537
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,390
series of cells that are highly active

538
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:43,019
bio synthetically for the production of

539
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:46,680
specific specialized metabolites there's

540
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,720
usually some kind of storage cavity we

541
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,640
found that this is actually preformed

542
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,240
and then essentially that space in

543
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,740
between just fills up and some of the

544
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,539
metabolites that you will find in

545
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,089
different glandular trichomes types

546
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,680
would be menthol and other monitor beans

547
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:04,889
and peppermint or a-missin and would

548
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:08,039
would be in a nice example in sweet

549
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,220
wormwood used as an anti-malarial Czaban

550
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,680
or na it's the only psychoactive

551
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:17,069
chirping known so far and then

552
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,840
tetrahydrocannabinol which I'm sure

553
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:23,309
you're all familiar with just on paper

554
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:26,159
of course and one of the important

555
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:28,169
questions for us was where does this

556
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,160
complex or a composition in peppermint

557
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,350
come from and that involved trying to

558
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,620
find out what the different

559
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:39,629
contributions from potential ancestral

560
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,869
species were to the very complex

561
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,440
hexaploid during genome of mentha

562
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:46,619
piperita

563
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,019
peppermint and it turns out that two of

564
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,279
the grandparents if you will we're a

565
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,789
memphis wahmbulance

566
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,569
or almond and menthol non-jew folia or

567
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:57,629
horseman

568
00:25:54,569 --> 00:26:00,059
those are diploid species they occur

569
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,520
naturally they are particularly

570
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,059
prominent in the Mediterranean and very

571
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:08,309
likely that's their origin my current

572
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:12,059
hypothesis is that it was the moments

573
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:15,240
that brought a spearmint like plant over

574
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,960
to Britain where eventually mentha

575
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,620
piperita

576
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,710
emerged peppermint was first found in a

577
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,759
place called mijin yes it's relatively

578
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,960
close to present-day

579
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,059
London and very likely humans did not

580
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,279
have have a hand in this it was a chance

581
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:35,609
discovery someone went into a field said

582
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,980
wow this smells nice and because it's

583
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:38,589
sterile because of that very very

584
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,558
complex

585
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:44,199
genome composition for comp copies from

586
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:47,109
meant Aquatica which is water mint very

587
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,819
common in england then one copy from

588
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:51,339
memphis what the orleans and one coffee

589
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:53,319
from menthol on jeff oh yeah you can

590
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:57,428
imagine what that does doing meiosis

591
00:26:53,319 --> 00:27:00,158
only bad things so it's Tara and that's

592
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:03,090
why everyone's been growing just

593
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,820
vegetatively propagated stuff there's no

594
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:09,298
there's no breeding there's also no

595
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:12,339
breeding with the most widely grown

596
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:15,158
spearmint which is native spearmint

597
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:18,308
it's a triploid same story you just

598
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,440
can't do a whole lot with it but what we

599
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:23,048
wanted to know is is how you power

600
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,450
metabolism in the cells that actually

601
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:29,259
make those essential oils i should

602
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:33,028
probably go back briefly so the

603
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:35,679
contribution from the water mint is

604
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:39,819
primarily a molecule called mentha

605
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:43,840
around then from the mentha spicata

606
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:47,408
comes it has a different hydroxylation

607
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:52,500
pattern from from peppermint so this is

608
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:54,789
the position c6 and all the c6 related

609
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,159
metabolites tend to accumulate in

610
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:59,379
spearmint you have a different position

611
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,990
that is functionalized in peppermint

612
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,640
it's the c3 position and you can see

613
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,390
that all the products that accumulated

614
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,590
in the oil from this pathway on are

615
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,169
functionalized in that position so that

616
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:13,058
kind of differentiates the two so we

617
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:16,330
wanted to know how you power

618
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:18,940
metabolism in there shawn johnson who's

619
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:22,808
now a postdoc with here in Hamburg at

620
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:25,778
MSU was very interested in building

621
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:28,148
genome scale models so in that case what

622
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:30,339
you do is you you summarize all the

623
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:35,079
information you can get on a species of

624
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:36,849
interest and you put this on top of

625
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,889
something that's already known so the

626
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,750
first genome scale models as you might

627
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,669
imagine were developed for a rabid

628
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,798
abscess they contain a few thousand

629
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:48,640
metabolic reactions and they were all

630
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:51,579
linked the the key there is that the

631
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,120
only parameter that's really important

632
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:55,990
they

633
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:58,329
is mass balance and then the second one

634
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,730
is the stoichiometry of all the

635
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:02,980
reactions has to add up those are the

636
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,349
only constraints there so there's no

637
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:09,460
kinetics in there the only information

638
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:11,619
you need is which enzymes use which

639
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,140
substrate make which product and what

640
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:16,629
are the cofactors and all of this across

641
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,450
hundreds or thousands of reactions has

642
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,210
to add up which is not trivial so

643
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:27,100
there's a lot of curation that has to go

644
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:30,130
into building these models and get them

645
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,719
to work so you extract information about

646
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,789
those reactions from various different

647
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,308
databases you use as much information as

648
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:39,250
you can that's all that is already

649
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:41,460
existing balancing the equations is

650
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,619
essentially what I just told you about

651
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,350
you need subcellular localization

652
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:48,788
because if you have different isozymes

653
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:50,408
doing different things in different

654
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:53,230
compartments you want to capture that

655
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:56,409
that then means that metabolites have to

656
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,028
be able to move between compartments so

657
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:02,049
all of this has to be accounted for

658
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:04,569
otherwise your model dies and then what

659
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:07,148
we also wanted to do is associate

660
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:09,519
reactions with transcripts primarily to

661
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:12,548
figure out which of the reactions in

662
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,339
this very large Network are actually

663
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:17,950
occurring so if you have pathways where

664
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:20,139
you need ten reactions and the genes for

665
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,450
all those ten enzymes are not present

666
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,000
well very likely that pathway is not

667
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,548
used in that cell type which is the

668
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,679
definition of a specialized cell type

669
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:33,009
they they don't do a whole lot of things

670
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,830
so you want to know what do they do so

671
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:37,990
that's something that we integrated and

672
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:41,019
there are some algorithms that also

673
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,759
allow you to integrate those for flux

674
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:45,788
predictions but you got to be careful

675
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:49,240
because transcription doesn't really

676
00:30:45,788 --> 00:30:52,658
translate directly to enzyme activity so

677
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,690
you have to use algorithms that are

678
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:57,940
based on unweighted measurements so the

679
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:01,509
impact of a change in transcription

680
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:04,670
level will not be as high as it would be

681
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:06,710
if you just if you didn't weight it so

682
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:10,670
it's still more than like a

683
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,890
presence/absence call then you expand

684
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:16,130
your network by the reactions that are

685
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:20,390
known to occur in your plant of interest

686
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:22,280
where your cell type of interest and you

687
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,840
essentially do a few other things that

688
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:28,160
you don't have to worry about too much

689
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:30,769
and it breaks it down into a system

690
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,200
that's a bit more simple okay so you

691
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:34,879
have leaves of peppermint they make they

692
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,400
have these glandular trichomes you have

693
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,590
the secretory cells within those

694
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,750
glandular trichomes it's a disc of eight

695
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:47,119
cells and you import a carbon source

696
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,609
these are non photosynthetic s-- so they

697
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,159
can't just take co2 from the atmosphere

698
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:54,979
you go through a network of reactions

699
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,009
and you make monoterpenes we can measure

700
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:00,220
a lot of the metabolites that are

701
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:02,960
required to make monoterpenes we can

702
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,730
measure all the monoterpenes and sesame

703
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,789
to our beans and also the flavonoids

704
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:10,370
that accumulate in the oil so that gives

705
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,309
us a system where we can now predict

706
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:15,619
what is the most likely path through all

707
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:20,869
the different possible reactions toward

708
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:24,619
these end products and one of the first

709
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:26,539
things that Shawn did was in Silicon

710
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:29,149
knockouts the question that you're

711
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:32,960
asking in that case is what's essential

712
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:37,280
if I knock out a reaction does that

713
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,519
network find some way around and still

714
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,200
produce the end product so you can you

715
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,359
can imagine in central carbon metabolism

716
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,539
there's usually some way around a

717
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,979
problem but once you get into the end

718
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:52,819
product pathways

719
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,230
there's none which is not unexpected so

720
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,929
essentially all the genes that are

721
00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:00,380
directly involved in making monoterpenes

722
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:04,130
and secreting those is is lethal

723
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,200
if you modeled it this as an in silico

724
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:10,280
knockout obviously you need to exchange

725
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,840
all the essential carbon oxygen and

726
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:15,619
hydrogen otherwise you can't make

727
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:20,480
anything you need to import sucrose or

728
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:25,339
some other oligosaccharide as a carbon

729
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,240
source but then you also need to worry

730
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:31,490
about energy equivalence you also need

731
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,519
to worry about the electrons for

732
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:38,049
reduction reactions because in this case

733
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:41,349
it was ferredoxin NADP reductase or FNR

734
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,819
that was returned as an essential enzyme

735
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:45,980
for producing monitor organs now you

736
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:49,369
might not think as that of being

737
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:55,240
directly related so that's why we looked

738
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:55,239
into this first of all the bioenergetic

739
00:33:55,779 --> 00:34:01,460
constraints here what this shows is

740
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:04,809
essentially a relative expression levels

741
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:08,449
based on RNA seek data for isolated

742
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:11,989
Glendora trichome cells so you can see

743
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:14,628
all the constituents of oxidative

744
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:17,178
phosphorylation and its relation with

745
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:20,029
the TCA cycle everything's expressed

746
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:22,700
they're there they're active and then we

747
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,980
asked well how does this work how much

748
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,839
co2 are you producing how much how many

749
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:31,010
monitor or what's the quantity of

750
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,320
monoterpenes produced from sucrose as a

751
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,320
carbon source so in this case it's it's

752
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,510
radio labeled sucrose we tested various

753
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,309
different concentrations and then we

754
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:44,450
used a legal medicine which is an

755
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:46,579
inhibitor of the ATP synthase so in the

756
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:50,829
presence of Aligarh my sin you should

757
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:53,480
not be able to generate ATP anymore if

758
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:57,230
this is the process by which you're

759
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,940
making and then at very low sucrose

760
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,619
concentrations you just don't make a

761
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,030
whole lot of monoterpenes well that

762
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:04,429
makes sense because if you don't have

763
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:06,170
carbon you can't make anything you go a

764
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:09,139
little higher this is one micromolar

765
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,180
milli molar in and these are experiments

766
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:14,869
with isolated secretory cells I should

767
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:17,119
mention that's a bit that's weird you

768
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:21,829
know if you so these are the controls

769
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,480
and you're making less monoterpenes but

770
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:26,869
you're still making them and if you go

771
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,360
to higher sucrose concentrations there's

772
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:31,299
really no difference so there needs to

773
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,690
be some other process that

774
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,690
also provides energy for these cells

775
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:40,210
that is not related to what I'm showing

776
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,760
you on this slide so one possibility

777
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,610
it's not very common to talk about

778
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:49,210
fermentation in plants but they actually

779
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,610
do this pollen tubes when they grow rely

780
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,539
on fermentation because they grow pretty

781
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,870
fast

782
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:59,590
these cells have to make terpenes very

783
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:01,389
very fast in in peppermint the oil

784
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:04,809
filling process of an individual

785
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:07,000
trichome takes only 25 to 30 hours it's

786
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:11,769
an almost visible quantity of oil

787
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,219
produced by 8 cells in 24 25 to 30 hours

788
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:18,429
enormous flux so maybe it's fermentation

789
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:21,699
so what you do is you're coupling the

790
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:25,980
recycling of nad NADH to the production

791
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:28,799
of ATP at the bottom end of glycolysis

792
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:32,289
you're generating ethanol in this case

793
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,820
and that that's a possibility microbes

794
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:39,400
do this all the time and they do it well

795
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:42,670
so again the modeling can help you a

796
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,550
little bit because you can ask if I

797
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:48,760
allow certain imports and if I allow

798
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:53,080
certain exports would you predict any

799
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,450
role for fermentation if I allowed these

800
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:58,269
reactions to be present so you can model

801
00:36:55,449 --> 00:37:02,019
without you can model with you can have

802
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:06,340
various iterations of this and at least

803
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:09,099
our initial calculations indicated if

804
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,809
you could could do fermentation you

805
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:12,519
would actually get a fairly high carbon

806
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:19,139
flux it would it would benefit the

807
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:22,360
entire system so we then went back Sean

808
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:25,329
did a number of staining x' you can

809
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,510
stain for alcohol dehydrogenase which is

810
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:30,639
one of the key enzymes to make ethanol

811
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:33,310
this is on the plant so you can see that

812
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,609
some of the glandular trichomes start to

813
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:39,429
stain very darkly in this case now not

814
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,590
all of them stain because the ones that

815
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:44,149
you would stain are the ones that are

816
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,390
actively secreting

817
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:51,079
and there is a there's a developmental

818
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:52,788
program that leaves go through and not

819
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,278
all of their Glenda trying homes are

820
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:57,230
active at the same time so it depends on

821
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:59,510
where you are on the plant and at what

822
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:02,889
stage you are if you're actually

823
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:05,569
actively secreting with the isolated

824
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:07,009
secretory cells you can see that you

825
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,929
know there there's different levels of

826
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:16,010
activity but there's certainly activity

827
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:18,259
there we then also looked at trichomes

828
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,589
that were isolated from young leaves

829
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:24,980
where you have a higher proportion of

830
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:29,119
glands in secretory phase with those of

831
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:32,298
mature and the labeling went from more

832
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,809
than 10% of all the glands being labeled

833
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:38,809
to essentially zero ADH activity was

834
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:41,450
very high in young glandular trichomes

835
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:45,559
was essentially lacking and mature ones

836
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:47,269
we had two isoforms that were detectable

837
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,720
in our transcriptome data sets we

838
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:54,108
express them purified them characterized

839
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,598
them and they had the typical km values

840
00:38:54,108 --> 00:39:00,348
of alcohol dehydrogenase which are

841
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:03,170
actually pretty high and the v-max

842
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:05,359
values that are also fairly consistent

843
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,369
with what's in the literature so there

844
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:09,078
might be an al-qaida you know RJ's we

845
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,910
might actually be going that path but

846
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,990
how does that relate to the data that I

847
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:18,170
showed you before

848
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:20,689
now if the km for the substrate of the

849
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,059
alcohol dehydrogenase is very high it

850
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,519
means you need pretty high

851
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:31,460
concentrations before this becomes a

852
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:34,420
viable source of recycling nad NADH and

853
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,789
producing ATP and that's consistent with

854
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:40,369
you need a whole lot of sucrose to get

855
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:43,400
enough flux into fermentation before it

856
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:45,740
actually makes sense and we estimate

857
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,019
that the sucrose concentration

858
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:50,298
unfortunately can't measure sucrose in

859
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:52,429
those cells because as you isolate them

860
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:55,130
they empty out all the small molecules

861
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:57,139
and then you have to refeed from a

862
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,099
carbon source which is an advantage in

863
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:59,900
some ways

864
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:02,088
but you can't determine how much is in

865
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,039
those cells unless you had a sensor or

866
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:06,889
something that would would give you in

867
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:08,749
deep in vivo concentrations but at least

868
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:14,389
as a model it makes sense that

869
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:16,098
fermentation would support the the

870
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:17,838
production of those monoterpenes and

871
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,298
again I apologize

872
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,518
I like these very complex schemes was

873
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:25,460
lots of stuff on there so this is this

874
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:27,199
is the pathway from precursors all the

875
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,849
way to lots of various different

876
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,228
monoterpenes it's essentially the same

877
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:32,479
pathway that I showed you with

878
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:35,419
structures before but here it's the

879
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:38,179
genes and enzymes that have been added I

880
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,869
just wanted to focus a little bit on

881
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:45,919
those those redox active enzymes which

882
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:49,880
have blown up here so I told you about

883
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:54,278
the ferredoxin nad p reductase or fnr

884
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:57,739
now in non photosynthetic cells the

885
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:59,659
transfer of electrons works opposite in

886
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,670
the opposite direction as in

887
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:05,420
photosynthetic cells so this has been

888
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:07,579
established in roots the redox potential

889
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,650
of the enzymes are different in that

890
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:12,769
you're actually starting with NADPH

891
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:15,170
you're transferring a hydride which

892
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:17,778
translates essentially in the transfer

893
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:22,099
of an electron but you're going from

894
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:25,219
NADPH to FNR to re reducing ferredoxin

895
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:27,619
which is the active enzyme that

896
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:31,009
interacts with those reductive enzymes

897
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:34,009
in the pathway toward monoterpenes so

898
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:36,528
this is the pre precursor pathway that

899
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:39,528
provides the precursors for monoterpenes

900
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:41,449
so you actually do need this enzyme in

901
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:45,469
this process we had never really thought

902
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:49,578
about it that much but the the modeling

903
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:52,068
essentially pointed us toward the fnr as

904
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,140
a potentially important player in this

905
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:57,679
so that that's one way you can use these

906
00:41:54,139 --> 00:42:00,858
models so what Shawn then did is he

907
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,409
looked at all the different isoforms and

908
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:08,420
again i'm i hope you can see this so

909
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:10,548
these are the isoforms of FNR that occur

910
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,510
in glandular trichomes and roots and

911
00:42:10,548 --> 00:42:14,420
they all

912
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,790
cluster together together across various

913
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,400
different species then you have the

914
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:21,769
photosynthetic ones which are different

915
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,200
different redox potential different

916
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:26,780
struck a different sequence and so on

917
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:29,059
and again they kind of cluster together

918
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,310
so that makes all that all makes sense

919
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:33,500
the surprise was here that when we

920
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:35,570
looked at the ferredoxin so the

921
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,219
substrate for the ferredoxin louie

922
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,260
ducktales you still have the

923
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:44,839
photosynthetic ones they cluster

924
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:46,580
together you do have a minor very lowly

925
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,039
expressed isoforms in glandular

926
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:50,869
trichomes and we did this with glandular

927
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,110
trichomes from various different species

928
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:57,289
and they cluster with the root isoforms

929
00:42:54,110 --> 00:43:00,039
of that have been characterized but you

930
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:02,869
have a separate one which is the major

931
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:06,559
isoform in all non-photosynthetic

932
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:09,730
glandular trichomes in the mint family

933
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:14,230
for example and they cluster separately

934
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:18,079
so it appears that there might have been

935
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:23,079
an event that led to the evolution of a

936
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,940
separate clade of ferredoxin enzymes

937
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:29,840
that is present in glandular trichomes

938
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:32,929
so how does that all fit together the

939
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:35,180
major and minor isoform if you cut off

940
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:37,250
the presidio targeting sequence and look

941
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:40,369
at what we believe is the mature protein

942
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:44,409
there's 12 differences in the sequence

943
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:48,159
at the amino acid level so you have

944
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:51,719
twelve possibilities of affecting the

945
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:56,109
interaction of the biosynthetic enzyme

946
00:43:51,719 --> 00:44:00,399
the electron transferring enzyme and the

947
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:01,990
the source of electrons which is the fnr

948
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,389
that you need to re reduce the

949
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:07,089
ferredoxin we don't think it's a

950
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:08,769
difference in redox potential because

951
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:12,210
that wouldn't make a whole lot of sense

952
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:14,920
we believe it's actually a difference in

953
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,449
the interaction between the proteins so

954
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,240
we've been able to do a little bit of

955
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:21,399
modeling but obviously you need to test

956
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:25,089
that and that is something that is that

957
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,760
Nate Boyer is now beginning to do a

958
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,880
graduate student so here you see the

959
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,540
pairwise interactions between in this

960
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,970
case the FNR and ferredoxin and there

961
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:39,099
are two residues at the interface where

962
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,889
electrons are being transferred that

963
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:43,839
could be important and this is the

964
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:48,940
interaction between the ferredoxin again

965
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:51,160
and the HDR so the biosynthetic enzyme

966
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:53,139
involved in monitoring biosynthesis

967
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:57,460
there is a total of six residues that

968
00:44:53,139 --> 00:45:00,759
are in locations where you could wear an

969
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:07,329
interaction might occur so it becomes if

970
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:10,360
you can measure the the heats that would

971
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:13,449
be differential during the interaction

972
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,789
of those different enzymes then you can

973
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:17,710
determine if the protein protein

974
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:20,320
interactions have an effect on total

975
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:21,579
flux through that enzyme so that's

976
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,860
something that we're trying to do now

977
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:25,860
obviously you need super clean proteins

978
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,110
for this you have to go to absolute

979
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:32,440
homogeneity and then you can use

980
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:34,000
isothermal Kalama tree and other methods

981
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,440
to really study the interaction so

982
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,389
that's something that we're trying to do

983
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,929
but we're not yet there then we asked

984
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:46,059
well is this something that is

985
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:48,539
transferable so can we can we transfer

986
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:51,489
what we've learned with meant to other

987
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:53,980
gland or trichome bearing plants because

988
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:57,539
quite a few of them including tomato

989
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:01,119
that number of people here interested in

990
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:05,619
so does what we've learned about mint

991
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:10,179
apply so we did genome scale modeling

992
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:12,819
for all the species where glandular

993
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:18,219
trichomes specific transcriptomes were

994
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:21,550
available now in this case we only used

995
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:22,869
Illumina datasets because it's very

996
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,060
difficult to get some of these

997
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:28,420
algorithms to work if you take data from

998
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:31,929
various different sources so that's why

999
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:34,150
tomato is missing tomato is the the

1000
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:36,219
stuff that's been released on glandular

1001
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:40,180
trichomes is old enough that it's still

1002
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:42,519
STS and not Illumina so we couldn't find

1003
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:44,980
datasets to use so we couldn't include

1004
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:46,780
tomato but there's there's other species

1005
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:50,440
that you'll see are interesting so

1006
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:55,240
here's the grand scheme you have some

1007
00:46:50,440 --> 00:47:00,429
that there is that can do photosynthesis

1008
00:46:55,239 --> 00:47:02,439
so you can generate reducing equivalent

1009
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:05,739
and ATP through photosynthesis you can

1010
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,820
couple this to the incorporation of co2

1011
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:13,229
like you do in photosynthetic cells you

1012
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:15,789
generate various different products from

1013
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:18,039
various different intermediates

1014
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:20,860
depending on the type of trichome you're

1015
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:23,199
looking at usually there will be

1016
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,180
specialized for example to accumulate

1017
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,339
terpenes certain types of terpenes maybe

1018
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:29,109
it makes small amounts of flavonoids as

1019
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,240
well there will be others that make

1020
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,890
large amounts of flavonoids but maybe

1021
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:34,989
not something else there will be

1022
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:36,849
something that accumulate a socialist

1023
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:39,339
but maybe not to many of the others

1024
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:41,559
bitter acids would be in hops and so on

1025
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,200
so you wouldn't have all of these

1026
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:47,409
reactions present in all of the

1027
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:50,469
trichomes but you can capture the

1028
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:54,039
diversity in metabolic pathways using

1029
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:56,859
these these metabolic models so what we

1030
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:59,460
were asking is first if you just look at

1031
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:03,160
gene expression patterns do they match

1032
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,740
what we would expect does the abundance

1033
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,259
of transcript somehow correlate with the

1034
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:10,179
abundance of end products and the answer

1035
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,380
is yes so

1036
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:16,239
or salty glosses which accumulates acyl

1037
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,340
sugars but primarily flavonoids

1038
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,699
flavonoid biosynthesis genes are highly

1039
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:23,650
expressed you see some a social roots

1040
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:27,819
but it's not a whole lot

1041
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:30,700
then solanum k2 NC accumulates more acyl

1042
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,590
sugars less flavonoids but still decent

1043
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:35,289
quantities and you can see that's

1044
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:38,440
reflected in the genes that are known to

1045
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:40,779
be involved in those processes this is a

1046
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,610
salvia it makes primarily dye terpenes

1047
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:46,690
and all the pathways that are involved

1048
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:48,970
in diterpene biosynthesis are highly

1049
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,980
expressed same for a salvia divinorum

1050
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:57,129
which makes a different set of that

1051
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:58,289
terpenes there mentha rita is very rich

1052
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,599
in monoterpenes

1053
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:03,219
has some sesame terpenes and again

1054
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,369
that's reflected in the gene expression

1055
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:08,169
patterns bitter acid biosynthesis in

1056
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:10,920
hops it's just huge the loop you learn

1057
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:14,559
glands it's almost nothing else in there

1058
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,829
pretty amazing then you have our

1059
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,320
colloids in camp Ithaca for example

1060
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:23,980
sesquiterpene Lac on tone and something

1061
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,800
called exam theum and then Robert OPS's

1062
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:29,349
that doesn't make anything in particular

1063
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:33,640
so you don't find those transcript as

1064
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:34,989
being enriched in at all now the other

1065
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:38,339
thing that was interesting if you look

1066
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:43,750
at the size of these these bubbles there

1067
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:46,090
there are two there are two species here

1068
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:48,070
that are known to be non-photosynthetic

1069
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:51,220
whether glands are non-photosynthetic

1070
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:55,570
that's harps and peppermint and in both

1071
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:58,209
cases the the number of transcripts the

1072
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:00,760
relative number of transcripts devoted

1073
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:03,460
to making these particular end products

1074
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,010
is is the highest so the degree of

1075
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,510
specialization appears to be even higher

1076
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:10,270
and those that are known for a synthetic

1077
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:12,640
and it might just reflect the fact that

1078
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:15,550
if you're harshly photosynthetic you can

1079
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:18,400
at least use other pathways to

1080
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:21,970
supplement here you have to be even more

1081
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,039
specialized so I apologize for the

1082
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:27,069
complexity of this slide this

1083
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:30,400
is modeling various different

1084
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:32,280
possibilities so different levels of

1085
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,780
photosynthesis photosynthesis

1086
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:40,960
unrestricted and sucrose uptake

1087
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:43,390
unrestricted both unrestricted here it

1088
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,280
is reduced sucrose uptake but still

1089
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:51,940
photosynthesis at full power fifty-fifty

1090
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,280
no photosynthesis I believe and and high

1091
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,590
sucrose uptake those were the four

1092
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,870
different scenarios that we modeled for

1093
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:00,430
all the different species and I'm just

1094
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:02,829
gonna pick one out

1095
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:05,259
once again it's it's very difficult to

1096
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:11,590
see all the different colors but what's

1097
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:13,960
what's highlighted here is with the with

1098
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:16,269
the blue squares those are reactions

1099
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,269
that we you would usually associate with

1100
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:21,969
heterotrophic metabolism its breakdown

1101
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:25,090
through glycolysis and so on toward a

1102
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:27,959
certain end product and you can see

1103
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:31,030
whenever you have sucrose present in

1104
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,579
high amounts if you allow sucrose to be

1105
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:37,150
used that's what they will do primarily

1106
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:38,920
even if their photosynthetic and there's

1107
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:42,190
actually experimental evidence from

1108
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:45,070
Alana CCA's lab in Germany he worked

1109
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:47,740
with tomato and he actually showed by

1110
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:50,170
feeding experiments that that is true so

1111
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:54,279
even the photosynthetic trichomes of

1112
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:56,619
tomato prefer an imported carbon source

1113
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,120
to doing their own photosynthesis so

1114
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:02,440
although their photosynthetic they only

1115
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:07,000
partially but if you if you reduce the

1116
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,980
amount of sucrose available then they

1117
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,130
will resort to photosynthesis if they

1118
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:15,849
can if they can't then everything breaks

1119
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:17,470
down and they don't make anything so you

1120
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:19,630
learn at least a little bit and I'll

1121
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:22,509
race through the rest very quickly I

1122
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:24,190
think they're pretty much out of time so

1123
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,020
one of the important questions is

1124
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:28,150
obviously okay what we're beginning to

1125
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:31,090
learn how these specialized cell types

1126
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:34,480
work what they do how they function

1127
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:37,000
but can we extrapolate this so that we

1128
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,960
can make predictions at a macroscopic

1129
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,690
level

1130
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,179
the questions yes we can so we first did

1131
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:49,030
this with peppermint that was Rigoberto

1132
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:52,118
Rios was no professor in Colombia he he

1133
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:56,170
counted glandular trichomes on leaves

1134
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:58,088
and at any given stage after Lisa

1135
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:00,190
merchants and you can see the numbers

1136
00:52:58,088 --> 00:53:02,469
are pretty high so you have to be a

1137
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:05,559
special kind of person to do this kind

1138
00:53:02,469 --> 00:53:07,649
of work so you have these grids you can

1139
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:10,239
count them and we've been able to

1140
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:13,030
associate the various different enzymes

1141
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,009
with different development stages and so

1142
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:17,950
on so essentially the models that we've

1143
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:21,490
built can now be used to go from a

1144
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:22,838
single cell type to the entire leaf and

1145
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:26,250
you could do the same for the entire

1146
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:31,150
plant we've done something similar for

1147
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:33,608
resin ducts in loblolly pine this just

1148
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:37,690
summarizes work that took many many

1149
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:40,269
years to do still unpublished so anyways

1150
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:42,849
this is a cross-section through a needle

1151
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:45,608
and you can see resin ducts here and

1152
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:49,630
there's a smaller one emerging here so

1153
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:51,789
you can you can determine the volumes of

1154
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:55,269
these resin ducts by microscopic

1155
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:58,179
measurements and you can extrapolate to

1156
00:53:55,269 --> 00:54:00,820
3d structures using various different

1157
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:04,118
assumptions and when you do that we can

1158
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:06,070
also measure the resin the olia resins

1159
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:09,280
that are being produced so when you

1160
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:11,650
project how much resin should be there

1161
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,910
based on just microscopic measurements

1162
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:17,500
and then extrapolation which is here -

1163
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:21,309
those that are actually measured we've

1164
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:25,570
done this for three entire trees big

1165
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:27,849
trees it is actually fairly close so if

1166
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:30,519
you understand what's happening at the

1167
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:32,380
single cell level you can in some cases

1168
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:35,460
if you're willing to put in a lot of

1169
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:39,750
time and you have very patient people

1170
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:44,260
you can extrapolate to entire organisms

1171
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:48,070
last example where this is cell C oh I'm

1172
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,930
sorry this is cell Sifu not regal she

1173
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:51,640
became a Buddhist nun after she finished

1174
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:54,129
so I'm not sure if

1175
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:56,068
it's for everyone to work on these kinds

1176
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,920
of projects she worked with citrus peel

1177
00:54:56,068 --> 00:55:01,568
her model system was grapefruit and you

1178
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,430
can see they have different shapes at

1179
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:06,038
different developmental stages so you

1180
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:07,838
have to capture this mathematically when

1181
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:09,910
you're going through all your thousands

1182
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:12,548
of microscopic images you have

1183
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:15,308
developmental patterns so you have fruit

1184
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:17,650
size versus volume per cavity and the

1185
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:22,479
distribution of different cavity sizes

1186
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:24,160
over fruit development and so on and you

1187
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:28,358
can make predictions of how much oil

1188
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:31,989
should be accumulated in in the peel and

1189
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:35,348
again the dotted line is what we

1190
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:37,358
predicted the solid line is what we

1191
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:40,359
measured and this was over to growth

1192
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:42,909
seasons for entire fruit so it actually

1193
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:45,308
works reasonably well so you can go from

1194
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:47,708
from single cell types again to entire

1195
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:50,469
fruit so anyways I think I've mentioned

1196
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:52,659
people who are involved in in my lab in

1197
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:54,190
the work for those that might be

1198
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:56,170
interested you can look at our website

1199
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:58,719
we do other things as well you also have

1200
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:01,568
a service center that might be of

1201
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,159
interest to people we've done a lot of

1202
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:04,929
collaborative work with Reuben Peters

1203
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:08,739
knob on the trip to region

1204
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:10,948
project the others were not as

1205
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:13,478
collaborative in this particular case

1206
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:16,389
funding came over the years from lots of

1207
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:19,058
different sources for the project but

1208
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:21,338
also for individual people from the NIH

1209
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:24,309
Fulbright and the human frontiers

1210
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:27,340
program and I believe that's the last

1211
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:34,280
slide so thank you for staying with me

1212
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:34,280
[Applause]

1213
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,929
[Music]

1214
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:51,728
ok so the question is do those cells

1215
00:56:49,088 --> 00:56:53,469
that produce ATP less efficiently when

1216
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:56,828
do they use fermentation than what they

1217
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:59,469
would do if it was through oxidative

1218
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:01,749
phosphorylation and the problem is we

1219
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:03,759
it's very difficult to quantify those

1220
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:05,389
processes we've looked at enzyme

1221
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:07,670
activities we've not measured

1222
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:09,460
ethanol production which would be what

1223
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:14,960
you would have to do for fermentation

1224
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:17,809
you can label but it's it's trying to

1225
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,480
quantify these exactly when you're

1226
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:23,539
working with these isolated cells is not

1227
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,110
trivial then when you when you're

1228
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:30,320
measuring co2 you always have to take

1229
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:35,329
into account that it's a process where

1230
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:37,160
you're trying to capture this and the

1231
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:40,009
some of the monoterpenes or other

1232
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:42,859
volatiles will be captured as you're

1233
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:47,800
trying to measure co2 so we've not found

1234
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:50,660
a technical approach that we found was

1235
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,730
quantitative enough to really answer the

1236
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:55,069
question we would love to know how much

1237
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:57,980
contribution you have from the two so

1238
00:57:55,070 --> 00:58:01,280
far it's you know they must be doing

1239
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:04,340
either one or both which are not

1240
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,480
mutually exclusive but quantifying this

1241
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,480
has been a real challenge

1242
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:21,019
cancer cells okay yeah yeah and you

1243
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:23,329
would think they do this when for some

1244
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:25,309
reason oxidative phosphorylation is not

1245
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:27,619
at its peak or they can't use that in

1246
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:30,019
the same way they would usually do so it

1247
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:33,619
would almost seem like it's a

1248
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:35,599
supplemental thing that would or that or

1249
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:44,230
the carbon sources hi which changes the

1250
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:44,230
kinetics it possible to do that yes yes

1251
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:09,699
yeah so I don't know if everyone could

1252
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:12,590
hear this it's a question about

1253
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:14,389
secretion and transport and it's been

1254
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:18,230
something that's bugged us for for many

1255
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:19,250
many years when we did ESD sequencing

1256
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:22,960
which is what

1257
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:26,960
you did before some of you were born

1258
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,599
then you would look at the abundance of

1259
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,490
these es T's and you would notice that

1260
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,829
there would be things like lipid

1261
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:36,619
transfer proteins in peppermint

1262
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:38,719
it was the most abundant transcript in

1263
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:42,259
glandular trichomes more than a percent

1264
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,939
of all the transcripts present we did

1265
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:46,670
some structure functional modeling at

1266
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:48,559
the time and so lipid transfer proteins

1267
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,230
are supposed to transport lipids from

1268
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:53,630
one marine membrane to the other and you

1269
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:56,030
can fit if you look at the Chris it's

1270
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,309
it's solution state structures NMR

1271
00:59:56,030 --> 01:00:00,560
structures that they have for the lipid

1272
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:02,659
transfer proteins you can fit one fatty

1273
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,239
acid chain in there and then the rest

1274
01:00:02,659 --> 01:00:07,730
just has to kind of sit there and it

1275
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:09,439
moves them for terpenes they have a

1276
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:11,900
different structure they're much smaller

1277
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,030
but they're a little bulkier and we

1278
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,700
could not come up with any mechanism

1279
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:18,890
that would give you any specificity so

1280
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:21,199
if you try it really hard you can fit a

1281
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:23,929
monoterpene in there but it never felt

1282
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:26,199
right so there are there are some

1283
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:28,639
transporters that people have found

1284
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:31,129
mostly through genetic approaches but in

1285
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:35,059
some cases also biochemically Natalia do

1286
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:37,039
nor ever reported one recently there's

1287
01:00:35,059 --> 01:00:39,170
been some older works on roots that

1288
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:42,619
secrete diterpene so people have found

1289
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:45,260
ABC transporters that when you make

1290
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:47,179
mutants then are impaired they are lipid

1291
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,210
transfer proteins in tobacco that have

1292
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:51,949
been associated but never had a

1293
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,659
structure function of a shown to

1294
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:56,329
actually work so there's there's there's

1295
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:58,609
evidence genetic evidence that this

1296
01:00:56,329 --> 01:01:01,069
could work the biochemical evidence is

1297
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:03,050
still somewhat weak and I'm still

1298
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,340
worried about specificity so I don't

1299
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,710
know how how these things would be

1300
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,470
specific enough for the types of

1301
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:11,090
volatile blends that you're producing

1302
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:13,459
that would then be secreted but it's

1303
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,309
it's a it's something that everyone

1304
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:18,760
wants to figure out but it's tough

1305
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:18,759
challenge

1306
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:32,400
this has been a production of Cornell
