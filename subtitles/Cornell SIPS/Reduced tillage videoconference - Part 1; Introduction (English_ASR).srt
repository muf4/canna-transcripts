1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
get sorry we're a little bit late but

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,200
welcome everybody glad that you're here

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,720
and again um just to make sure that uh

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,719
just for the sake of being able to hear

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
each other that when you're not speaking

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,080
or we're not entertaining questions or

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,919
hearing from growers at your location

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
please hit the mute button facilitators

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,879
that would be awesome

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,640
okay so this is our second

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,879
um annual sort of video conference

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,560
focusing on transitioning to reduce

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,719
tillage

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,719
um i have a powerpoint that i'm using

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,640
and i'm assuming that

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,880
uh the powerpoint that you guys can see

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
that if you cannot see it please let us

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
know

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,718
all right

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,320
i'm gonna move to um just basically a

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
quick overview again of what our effort

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,759
has focused on we have been focusing for

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,159
the last several years on really trying

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,079
to help growers um

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,198
uh increase the use of reduced tillage

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,480
in their vegetable operations

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,320
so our efforts

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,599
the upper northeast and cooler areas of

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,439
the northeast

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,198
and we've been focusing our research and

31
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,599
education efforts with growers on

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,759
overcoming basic challenges that we know

33
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,359
exist and we're trying to overcome them

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,799
looking at weed management issues

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,159
dealing with soil quality soil

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,799
compaction

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
ensuring that we can actually get timely

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,920
harvest

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,438
of the crops that we're growing

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
dealing with pests and

41
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,719
looking at harvest strategies

42
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,719
there's been issues with processing

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,920
crops that we've had conversations

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,519
around

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,519
the other area of work that we have and

46
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,359
that we help people to develop and

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,519
identify equipment or strategies that

48
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,359
are appropriate for all scales

49
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,798
so much

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,478
there's a lot of equipment out there

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,240
that's available for larger operations

52
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,560
that can handle the four rows or six

53
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:49,039
journaling higher than that but dealing

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,118
with a small scale operations two-wheel

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,399
uh setup we've been really interested in

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,000
trying to work with growers and

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
developing units that are appropriately

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
at scaling

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
and then finally we want to we continue

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
to work to do demonstrations on farm and

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,399
on station we've got basically

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
a really exciting collaboration now that

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,800
goes across the northeast

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
to really test and make um make some of

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
these demonstrations available to

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,200
growers so they can actually look and

67
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,519
see how our crops performing

68
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,679
so um one thing that i wanted to do is

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
to highlight really quickly uh some of

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
the work that's going on we just got

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,400
funded recently by northeast sayre

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,759
and the focus is to look at deep zone

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,159
village which we're going to talk a lot

74
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,959
about today um to try to actually

75
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,840
address a particularly um uh difficult

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
pest

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,598
by toddler capsule

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
and our reason for taking this on and

79
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,959
looking at this is that we believe that

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
the soil management and soil quality

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,680
improvements in doing deep zone tillage

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
will actually reduce the speed of the

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
development of the disease in fields

84
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,680
that are affected

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,239
and um and so we have trials that are

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,840
going on um on farms that have a history

87
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,120
of the disease and we are looking for

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,200
more collaborators for this coming year

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,239
um but what we want to do is to be able

90
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,079
to uh look um both we have on station

91
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,080
trials at research firms believe it or

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,159
not we do have research farms at halfway

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
top or capsi and in fact it cultivated

94
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,439
in some ways

95
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,840
but we also then um doing charles on

96
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,598
farm over three years where we set up

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
fields that are paired

98
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,799
with deep zone tillage and then their

99
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,958
traditional conventional tillage

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
whatever you might be using

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,878
and on those fields we want to actually

102
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,158
look at soil moisture

103
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,479
soil water management changes in the um

104
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,239
the amount of saturation that we see in

105
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,238
fields and then eventually with a

106
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,360
susceptible crop see if we actually do

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,959
delay the onset of pcap

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
and so that people can harvest for a

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,680
longer period in those years we might

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,120
have

111
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,719
conducive

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,680
sort of moisture conditions for the

113
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,400
development of the disease

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
so

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
if you are interested and i put this out

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
there now so as we go through the day

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,158
and we have these conversations around

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
equipment and management and other

119
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,280
issues that if you are interested in

120
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,000
collaborating with us we would welcome

121
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,318
that uh we are looking for growers um

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,719
that have uh fields with a history of by

123
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,479
toth their capstone

124
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,719
and um you'd have to come we'd like to

125
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,079
have two fields on any farm so that we

126
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,680
know that there's different rotations

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,000
that people are using at this time and

128
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
so we want to be able to uh set up

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,319
fields where we do zone telegen part and

130
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,319
conventional in the others

131
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,439
and the goal is that over the next few

132
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,759
years that you're working with us that

133
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,120
you do grow a susceptible crop in these

134
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,080
fields at least once so that we can

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
actually look at the disease onset

136
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,918
and then we ourselves the team will

137
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,520
actually be at your firm and doing soil

138
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,599
health tests looking at

139
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,240
soil health soil quality water

140
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,520
infiltration soil moisture retention and

141
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,120
other aspects of how this system affects

142
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,198
soils in those particular fields

143
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
and as part of that we want to be able

144
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,439
to get a sense from all of you who are

145
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
doing these trials as to

146
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,399
are you seeing other benefits of doing

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
some improvements

148
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,758
until around labor hours school

149
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,959
practices management overall

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,520
impressions with the system

151
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,839
uh in addition particularly in new york

152
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,599
we have funding to help offset some of

153
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,119
the cost to set up a trial so if you

154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
don't have this equipment but you want

155
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,959
to try zone tillage

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,879
we have some funding from both new york

157
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,719
farm viability we were reinstated with

158
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,879
our funding with that group

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
for one year and at least for one more

160
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,279
year we're not sure what the status is

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
of the new york farm viability institute

162
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,879
but we do hope that they continue to

163
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
receive funding to help growers

164
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,279
in agriculture in new york

165
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,120
but between farm viability and the the

166
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,758
new york state specialty crop research

167
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
initiative uh we have cost share funds

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,240
and these funds can be used to sort of

169
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,560
supplement and help a lower the cost of

170
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
renting equipment depending on the size

171
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
and certainly if you're four row or if

172
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
you can handle four row equipment you

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
would look at renting from a dealer and

174
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,280
we have a network of dealers around the

175
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
state that are willing to work with you

176
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,239
and we can help

177
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,318
pay for some of the transportation costs

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,199
the rental costs and then um

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,080
the per acre cost that they charge

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,639
or if you have smaller system we at

181
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,038
cornell have several different units

182
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,960
that are two row um that we have

183
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,279
available for use on farms and then on

184
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,879
long island and in western eastern new

185
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,318
york there are also two road units that

186
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,000
are available

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,759
so i just wanted to make that aware make

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,279
you aware of it if you're interested in

189
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,800
working with us and doing a trial or

190
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,399
setting up a trial

191
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,000
definitely contact your local extension

192
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,839
educator because they would be the ones

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,120
to help facilitate this and then we

194
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,638
could get

195
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,478
sort of talk with you about how to set

196
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,478
up one of these trials on your farm

197
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
so this is just a picture of one of the

198
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,560
units of jim capron who's in western new

199
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,560
york helped us build this unit and the

200
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,918
objective of this trial unit is to allow

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,399
you to do some deep placement of

202
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,240
nitrogen or uh if you're using

203
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,719
conventional dry fertilizer you can put

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,478
this on it's two-row only

205
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,840
but it is set up to actually do some

206
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,199
fertilizer placement

207
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:07,279
experiments uh we're also building a

208
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,280
very small lighter weight unit that um

209
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,279
that will work with smaller tractors and

210
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,839
this is using a yeoman's

211
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,000
plow these plows were developed in new

212
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,478
zealand for managing moisture and water

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,079
on pastures but they create the same

214
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,478
kind of

215
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,240
disturbance fracturing deep soil that's

216
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,680
compacted and creating a nice area

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
that's worked

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
for planting in order for direct seeding

219
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,918
or transplanting vegetables

220
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,598
and then we also have a two-row zone

221
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,560
builder that we have taken to different

222
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,159
farms

223
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
around the state to help them set up

224
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,520
trials and test

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,960
deep zone tillage

226
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,719
and this is a picture of the unit that's

227
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,638
in eastern new york that chuck barton

228
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,319
has and i know growers have used use

229
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,000
this trial unit for doing demonstrations

230
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
so with that i just want to make sure

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,918
that you're aware of the website where

232
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,679
we have case studies and other

233
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,000
information

234
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,319
previous people's experiences

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,399
from trying uh zone fillet on their

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
farms focused on vegetables and again if

237
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,598
you are really focused on vegetables i

238
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
know we get a lot of folks coming that

239
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,839
do field crops as well and that's great

240
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,839
but we don't talk about them too much

241
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,758
um and so with that i basically just

242
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
wanted to give you an overview and a

243
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,160
highlight

244
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,839
as far as the next part of our agenda

245
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,319
we wanted to be able to

246
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,918
um move into a conversation on equipment

247
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,680
and and have a chance for growers to

248
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,199
learn and share from each other

249
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
about different equipment that they're

250
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,879
using and what their experiences have

251
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,120
been

252
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,120
betsy do you have a copy of the current

253
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
and um and so uh for this part of it we

254
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,159
do actually have

255
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,319
um we do have a powerpoint that if and

256
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,240
we have some pictures that we can put up

257
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
uh based on if growers have anything

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,159
specific that they want to be talking

259
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,040
about around their equipment

260
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,719
and then after that point at 10 o'clock

261
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,039
we'll have to break and then we're going

262
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
to bring thomas bjorkman in to talk a

263
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,879
little bit more specifically on cover

264
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,319
crops and the tillage radish there's

265
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,879
been a lot of growers interested in

266
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
tillage radish

267
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,399
and so we want to have the chance to

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
talk about um that some cover crops and

269
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,559
how we integrate cover crops into these

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
deep zone tillage systems

271
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,079
and then we're going to focus in on weed

272
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,759
management issues

273
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
uh there's some specific questions that

274
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,319
growers have generated that we've asked

275
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,759
rich vana to address for us

276
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
and

277
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,399
he and robin belinder have been talking

278
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
about some of these issues so he'll be

279
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,399
talking to us about that and then we'll

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
come back at the end on more

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,839
experiences related to fertility

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,839
management that growers have been using

283
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,880
different strategies

284
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,560
so again we're connected this morning um

285
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,000
together and so it's a chance for us to

286
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,159
be able to learn across these different

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,679
locations i'll learn from growers in

288
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,159
other parts of the region as to what's

289
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,319
working and what's not for them

290
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,439
we're going to when we break for lunch

291
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,839
we are happy to buy you lunch today

292
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
but we do encourage you afterwards is

293
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
that we want to have time and local

294
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,799
discussions

295
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,399
both if you want to participate in these

296
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,000
trials and work with us to do

297
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
demonstrations or to actually get

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
involved with the phytophthora

299
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,040
experiments

300
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
please do uh think about that and talk

301
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,278
with your educator about that

302
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,799
but also we want to have a

303
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,320
have local discussions on what do we

304
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,319
need to know what other research

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
questions or other issues need to be

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
addressed to help growers take up these

307
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,879
systems and we need feedback from you as

308
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,639
you think about

309
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,759
how you might apply these on your own

310
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,799
farm

311
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,720
and then

312
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,719
also we have a short evaluation that

313
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,639
we're asking you to take for us

314
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
all of this work is funded by grants and

315
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,879
they always want to know um how are we

316
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
doing and what are we learning and our

317
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,879
our what else do we need to do or focus

318
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,440
each of work on

319
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,600
so with that what i might i'd like to do

320
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,279
is um i'll quickly uh check in with

321
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
folks if there's any questions about

322
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,480
anything i've said or any questions

323
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,399
about the agenda

324
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
how i'll do that is i'll go side to side

325
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,278
so let's start with carol in western new

326
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
york

327
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,039
are there any any questions before we

328
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,000
get started on the equipment section

329
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,399
carol what questions before we start

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
looking at and discussing equipment

331
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
no

332
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,320
no no all right

333
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,240
all right how about new mass

334
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,720
uh andy anybody have questions

335
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
so far

336
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,439
looks like we're good

337
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,799
all right um how about log island

341
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,958
question related to the powerpoint that

342

was sent uh with all the equipment is

343
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,399
that something that you'd like us to

344
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,000
show before we have that general

345
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,078
discussion or not

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,799
um that powerpoint has pictures that

347
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,319
growers may refer to in the discussion

348
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,359
