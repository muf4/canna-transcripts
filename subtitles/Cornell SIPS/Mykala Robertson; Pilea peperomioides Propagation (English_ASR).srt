00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,240
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:13,759
University let's talk POA peperomioides

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,320
propagation the palea peperomioides

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,118
plant or also the UFO or Chinese money

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,879
plant is a popular house plant with

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,960
coin-shaped leaves and I'm going to show

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,679
you how to propagate it here's some

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,160
materials you might need some gloves or

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:31,480
Clean Hands um sanitizing agent and a

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,558
blade some nice in soil I like one with

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,439
nice moisture holding capacity for

12
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,238
better

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,320
rooting and some plug trays or spare

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
pots next I'm going to show you how

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,079
we're going to propagate here's the

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,238
mother plant with a lot of little

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,079
offshoots or pups coming up around the

18
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:52,000
base we can also have these little uh

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,160
below the ground root cuting with new

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,878
pups that haven't emerged yet here I'm

21
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,839
going to remove some of the soil to make

22
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,358
it easier to access some of these cuting

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,440
that we're going to take here's a nice

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,280
cutting from the root we'll just come in

25
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,959
with a clean blade and Clean Hands and

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,960
take a cutting

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,719
here and there you go we have some nodes

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,560
for root establishment nice leaves this

29
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,798
should make a really nice cutting

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,079
there's also some cuting you can take

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,880
around the base of the stem here's one

32
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,000
as long as we have some nodes it should

33
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,319
establish just

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,680
fine next after you've taken as many

35
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,839
cuting as you want you can take them and

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,840
put them in the pot in media of your

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,719
choice I like this Pete Moss uh potting

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,280
media with a little pearly because it

39
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,840
has nice moisture holding capacity for

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,439
better route

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,320
establishment and here's some progress

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,559
shots so this is 3 days after the

43
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,679
initial cutting you can see some roots

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,549
coming out from where those nodes are

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,000
this is about 5 days after the initial

46
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,879
[Music]

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,118
cutting here we have six days nice root

48
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:03,078
establishment coming out of those nodes

49
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,799
and finally this is one week after our

50
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,679
initial cutting this should be ready to

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,000
grow and establish very well and enjoy

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,599
your new

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,719
plants this has been a production of
