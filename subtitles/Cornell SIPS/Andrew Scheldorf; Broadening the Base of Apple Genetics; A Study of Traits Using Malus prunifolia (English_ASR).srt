1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,700
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,700
University

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,379
okay

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,480
thank you Jason for that introduction

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,599
and thank you everyone for coming

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,260
to listen to my seminar um this is a

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,320
partial completion of my B exam as well

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,720
um so it's incredibly special to me

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,518
um as mentioned my topic or my seminar

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,198
is broadening the base of Apple genetics

11
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,059
a study of traits using malice

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,539
printfolia

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,100
so before we really get into the meat of

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,640
my project itself I wanted to give us

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,640
some framing information about Apple

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,140
breeding and how we got here in the

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,079
state of the world of Apple genetics and

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,058
breeding the Apple Center of origin is

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,759
thought to be in Kazakhstan in the

20
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,459
cosmic mountains with a population of

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,280
medium to large fruits in these

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,878
mountains with early hybridizations from

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,859
malice picata and Malice asiatica which

24
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,158
are thought to be possibly originally

25
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,219
isolated groups of malice versii which

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,340
is one of the founding species

27
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:14,118
humans then carried these larger fruited

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,640
malice the versii along the Silk Road

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:20,219
resulting in further hybridizations with

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,859
possibly some other Asian species such

31
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,719
as malice parnifolia until arriving in

32
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,000
Europe where there was a late intense

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,879
inters-specific hybridization with

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,099
malice sylvestress which is a

35
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:35,938
species known to be firmer and more

36
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:39,179
acidic but smaller in fruit size

37
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:42,839
later more intentional selection and

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,220
growing resulted in the malice domestica

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,799
that we are more familiar with today

40
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:52,078
which is known to be firm sweet aromatic

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,399
tart with larger fruits

42
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:59,099
so that story of domestication

43
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,739
and there is uh Sylvester's

44
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,140
so that story of domestication then led

45
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,419
to into hundreds of years of intentional

46
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,118
Apple selection and breeding by humans

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,580
to bring us here where we have amazing

48
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,199
cultivars such as Snapdragon and Ruby

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,340
Frost New York one and year two which

50
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,780
were released from Cornell rather

51
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,000
recently

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,300
Apple if you're unaware is a clonally

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,239
propagated species and fruit is marketed

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,180
by cultivar this has resulted in certain

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,580
cultivars becoming more widely planted

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,739
and more widely sold

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,020
um and these Coast buyers mostly have

58
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,180
larger fruit with lower acid higher

59
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,680
sweetness and they're often red in color

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
or have a blush

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,480
how we market and sell Apples by

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,640
cultivars have

63
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,738
for commercial use has resulted in a

64
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,439
reduction in diversity of apples that

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,800
are grown for commercial use

66
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,719
though breeding pools and repositories

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,819
like the one in Geneva show higher

68
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,979
diversity still so we have not like lost

69
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,000
the diversity of malice in this breeding

70
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,818
efforts

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,800
here we have in the graph we have the

72
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,079
top nine cult bars that are sold in the

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,360
US you are likely pretty familiar with

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,180
these cultivars you know Granny Smith

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,060
pink lady Golden Delicious Gala red

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,420
delicious Honeycrisp and Macintosh to

77
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,199
name them and Fuji

78
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,958
um

79
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,959
and these first degree relationships are

80
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,340
demonstrated by these gray circles and

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,840
that just means that they are otherwise

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,580
a sibling a parent or a child of these

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,439
very popular cultivars and there's

84
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,640
plenty of hybridization between these as

85
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,139
well as results in a rather reduced

86
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,298
amount of

87
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,539
cultivars commercially available and

88
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,780
this has resulted in some problems

89
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:51,298
specifically related around disease

90
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,299
and disease resistance

91
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,580
which brings us to my project so malice

92
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,159
per napolia is a West Asian species of

93
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,340
Apple that was possibly involved in

94
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,699
domestication along the Silk Road

95
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,140
um depicted here in a photo it would be

96
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,199
on the

97
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,619
um smaller malice species on the

98
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,419
left of your screen

99
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,160
and then you can see here on the right A

100
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,798
diversity panel of all of the malice for

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,959
Napoleon inside of the genetic

102
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,120
repository in Geneva

103
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,220
and you can see that Mal's per napole is

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,220
a species really runs the gamut in sorts

105
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,440
of fruit shaped color and size and so

106
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,540
it's a rather interesting species the

107
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,560
specific mouse pernipolia that I have

108
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:40,139
used in my study is malice per Napoleon

109
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,180
19651 which from here on out I am just

110
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,160
going to refer to as nalospernifolia I

111
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,900
will trip over those numbers constantly

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,620
if I don't

113
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,739
um

114
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,899
this individual has been used as a part

115
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,460
of the malice core collection which

116
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,978
means it has been included in multiple

117
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,560
linkage studies and mapping studies and

118
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:01,079
as a individual it clusters with other

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,120
Asian species but not always with other

120
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,879
prunipolia sessions and it's

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,740
dihedgehogon profile which dihydrocos

122
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,100
are phenolic compounds that are of

123
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,918
interest in increasing beneficial Health

124
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,660
compounds in apple it's definitely

125
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,758
profile indicates that there was some

126
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,680
species add mixture in its background so

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,139
we're not even sure that it's actually

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,418
Metals per napolia but it is the

129
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,560
designation that we are currently using

130
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:30,240
and this it's of interest because of a

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,939
um because of its apparent strong fire

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,100
blight resistance and

133
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,978
um there's a thing

134
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,080
and other biochemical traits as well as

135
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,538
its usefulness as a wild species in

136
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,579
genetic studies trying to understand

137
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:49,038
um novel traits from uh not

138
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,038
underutilized species in breeding

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,300
the other parent in this population of

140
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,819
trees is called New York co1 Co stands

141
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,319
for columnar and it is a malice X

142
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,478
domestica meaning it is the standard

143
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,819
domestic domesticated Apple that we are

144
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,819
familiar with it has columnar habits

145
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:12,659
meaning that it is grows very vertically

146
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,399
upright with short Spurs and very few

147
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,900
outward branches so it's more like a

148
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,179
pillar I have some photos of it coming

149
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,739
up later and in its background it has

150
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,959
panova which is a German cultivar

151
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,500
sunkris and widget Macintosh which

152
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,899
widget Macintosh is the origin of the

153
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,300
columnar Habit in Malice

154
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,359
and it is a large fruited individual

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,300
with yellow skin and a slight blush to

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,460
it and other characteristics I will be

157
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,680
listing later so these two individuals

158
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,599
are quite different which results in a

159
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,280
rather interesting display of trait

160
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,280
segregations that I will be touching on

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,699
so as a general summary of this

162
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,918
population like I said it was a

163
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,538
cross-made between New York co1 and

164
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,538
Malice pernafolia

165
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:59,339
and it resulted in 600 seeds that were

166
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,939
then germinated a number of them died

167
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:05,459
due to a lethality Gene and resulted in

168
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,620
a validated population of 423

169
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,318
individuals which I validated to using

170
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,180
GBS markers and PCA principal component

171
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,240
analysis and that broke down into 228

172
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,639
226 standard trees and 197

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,079
um

174
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,418
columnar trees which is about 50 50

175
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,038
which is what we would expect in the

176
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,719
segregation ratio and then there's dwarf

177
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,399
types within that I'm not really going

178
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,780
to be touching on tree architecture

179
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,859
during this talk though there are some

180
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,719
interesting

181
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,699
um components of that that I will be

182
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,020
discussing in Publications and findings

183
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,020
later

184
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,538
foreign so briefly this talk is going to

185
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,399
focus on three things uh fruit storage

186
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,219
and I will be talking about storage

187
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,258
genes and genotypes associations and

188
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,720
then an rna-seq experiment that was used

189
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:55,080
to clarify kind of what's going on in

190
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,419
storage fruit organic acidity genetics

191
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,879
um pH and detergentful acid was measured

192
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,978
associations were found and then I'll be

193
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,319
discussing deviations and distortions

194
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,300
unique to this population or unique to

195
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,879
this breeding pool in general and then

196
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,360
lastly fruit quality traits which I will

197
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,560
just be touching briefly on fruit size

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,319
however I measured a number of other

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,660
traits including bricks presence of

200
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,939
brusset and phenolic compounds along

201
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,759
with several others

202
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,500
and isn't this such a pretty image this

203
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,500
their siblings and have very different

204
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,360
colors flowers but they're both columnar

205
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,519
this population is really stunning in

206
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,158
flowering and fruiting just in kind of

207
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,918
the breadth that it covers and it's

208
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:41,399
always fun to walk through

209
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,500
so I followed this population for um

210
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,539
four years three pretty intensely and

211
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,539
then one with some

212
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:51,838
um extra data to get three years to

213
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:54,000
report on so in 2019 176 individuals

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,860
fruited the traits that I collected are

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,980
listed there including total acid pH

216
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,500
bricks phenolic compound shape and size

217
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,700
color and then fruits and cuticle

218
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,559
disorders 2020 288 individuals fruited

219
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,778
and all those previous traits were

220
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,559
collected as well as mass and then I

221
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:15,720
added a color rimner to the technical

222
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,919
mix so I could measure more accurate

223
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,839
color 2021 306 individuals fruited and

224
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,259
RNA samples were taken along with all of

225
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,660
that previous data and then I checked

226
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,860
the population for starch iodine index

227
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:34,679
at Harvest uh 2022

228
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,839
308 individuals fruited and I continued

229
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,699
collecting data for storage time

230
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,399
fruit size and then external

231
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,399
characteristics in that I was seeing

232
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,859
so in order to do any sort of genetic

233
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,759
study we need to have genotype for the

234
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,639
population

235
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,759
so this population was genotyped using

236
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,740
uh genome by sequencing or GDs

237
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,259
um and a collaboration between Cornell

238
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,519
USDA and housing University it was then

239
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,679
aligned to the Golden Delicious double

240
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,778
haploid reference genome and I used a

241
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,539
principal component analysis depicted

242
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:12,299
here on the left to I identify and

243
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:14,219
remove any outcrosses so the two points

244
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:15,958
on the far side of the charts are the

245
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,019
two parents and the cloud in the center

246
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,239
are all the progeny the 22 outcrosses

247
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,120
were identified and discarded and then a

248
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,860
further outcross was found in genotyping

249
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,700
later on and was also discarded before

250
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,200
analysis the filter settings I have are

251
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,200
there and it resulted

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:40,320
in 51 442 sites which is plenty for a

253
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:44,640
genetic study and so my genetic analysis

254
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,260
has been pretty robust which is exciting

255
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,919
so the first trait that I'm going to

256
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,419
talk about here is apple storage and in

257
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,578
the first year approving this population

258
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:55,679
only had like 22 individuals fruit in

259
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,319
2018 when I first got here but even in

260
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,899
that small subset of individuals there

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,820
was an apparent segregation of long

262
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,578
storing fruits that stayed well in the

263
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,778
cooler on par with mouse mestica and

264
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,359
short storing fruits some of which

265
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,399
sonest on the tree and some snest very

266
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,740
quickly in the cooler and I have quite

267
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,899
an interest in reducing food waste and

268
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,820
so I found the straight to be of great

269
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,220
interest

270
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,339
it's also important to note that since

271
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,600
this is an inter-specific population

272
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,700
and because of what we know from

273
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,560
domestication studies and apple fruit

274
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,540
firmness and the ability to store fruit

275
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,819
appears to be a trait that we selected

276
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,759
upon in the early days of domestication

277
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,680
and fruit breeding and so adding in this

278
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,539
wild species gives a kind of Novel

279
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,958
chance to look at some of these

280
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,659
domestication genes and what we should

281
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,219
really consider as we're working towards

282
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:50,578
using wild species and future Apple

283
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,278
breeding so my hypothesis is listed

284
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,439
there briefly genetic differences are

285
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,059
causing differences in storage time

286
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,459
phenotypes and then my questions are

287
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,739
listed there what genes are causing

288
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,679
these differences are external biotic

289
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,079
effects causing them and really what

290
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,278
effects are these genes having on the

291
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,278
fruit over storage time

292
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,539
storage is intensely researched in apple

293
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,399
um and

294
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,139
since apple is a commonly propagated

295
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,299
crop most of the research has been

296
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,100
focused on modifying the environment

297
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,319
surrounding the fruits whether in

298
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,240
growing or in storage

299
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,459
um and not as much Focus has been given

300
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,259
on genetic causes and that's mostly

301
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,659
because once a cultivar is released and

302
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,319
becomes popular we can't retract it to

303
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:39,899
fix an issue in storage and so we work

304
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,720
on modifying the environment around it

305
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,820
however I really wanted to look into the

306
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,839
genetic causes of storage ability that

307
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,839
I'm seeing in this population

308
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,259
so here if you've been in any sort of

309
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,480
intro storage class

310
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,120
you see a ripening curve for climacteric

311
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,759
fruit which apple is one you can see the

312
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,440
trends in respiration and growth as well

313
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,259
as the interplay with ethylene which is

314
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,560
a plant growth hormone that is heavily

315
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,480
tied to plants respiration plant growth

316
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,399
and then fruit ripening

317
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,440
um

318
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,419
with this understanding I then looked

319
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,940
into genes that had been previously

320
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,639
identified in other studies in relation

321
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,160
to ethylene as well as storage the

322
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,100
Ethylene the ethylene biosynthesis

323
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,360
pathway is depicted here with the genes

324
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,700
of interest that I'm going to talk about

325
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,800
in blue

326
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,800
ACO and ACS have been identified in

327
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,799
apple and somewhat well characterized

328
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,439
these genes have been identified and

329
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,719
known to affect ethylene production over

330
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,959
storage time

331
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,540
and so here's more information ACO is

332
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,659
located on chromosome 10. it is the

333
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,338
final step of ethylene biosynthesis and

334
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,139
has been associated with increased

335
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,040
ethylene production

336
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,459
um

337
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,319
for a long time ACO was considered like

338
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,778
not that much of a factor in storage but

339
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,180
more recent Studies have indicated that

340
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:11,578
it is more of a rate limiting step than

341
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,979
previously thought ACS is the first step

342
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:16,439
in this two-step pathway and has

343
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,139
previously been reported as the rate

344
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,940
limiting step it's located on chromosome

345
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:26,100
15 and also is increased with increase

346
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,399
associated with increased ethylene

347
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,399
production

348
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,759
right

349
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,040
but first before I got

350
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,439
um into that I wanted to look to see if

351
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,879
there were any biotic causes of these

352
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,339
storage differences

353
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,799
um in this population so Blue Mold which

354
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,540
is a penicillium is the most number one

355
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,859
it's the number one post-harvest

356
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:49,799
pathogen

357
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,839
um in apple storage and so I created a

358
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,299
subset of the population half of them

359
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,699
being long story individuals that I

360
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,838
attract at least a year previously and

361
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:00,838
half of them being short-term

362
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,000
individuals and tested them for Blue

363
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,680
Mold resistance by stabbing them with

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,720
the nail and putting penicillium

365
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,519
inoculum into that wound and then

366
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,100
placing them into an inoculation chamber

367
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,320
also known as a large plastic taupes

368
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,720
with wet paper towels to maintain

369
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,100
humidity and ensure inoculation and

370
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,220
sporulation

371
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,500
and from that

372
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,120
no complete resistance was observed so

373
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,820
all of the fruit did get infected with

374
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,980
blue mold and there however there was

375
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,720
some slight variation in time to

376
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,278
sporulation but not enough to be

377
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,459
significant

378
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,439
okay

379
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,819
as mentioned before ethylene is very

380
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,100
important in Fruit ripening and

381
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,379
senescence so the same subset was

382
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,839
brought down here to the Watkins lab

383
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:47,578
with Yosef and Chris Watkins to be

384
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,500
measured for internal ethylenes so a

385
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:52,138
measurement of gas was taken from the

386
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,240
internal seed chamber and from that no

387
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,220
real pattern of

388
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,959
um was found between the two classes so

389
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,360
no pattern in long story and short

390
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,059
storing storing however this is likely

391
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,060
due to the fact that the fruits

392
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:09,119
um there was ripeness differences in the

393
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,599
fruits um caused by its intra-specific

394
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,799
background I can't use standardized

395
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,019
ripening metrics like starch iodine

396
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,819
index and penetrometers because the

397
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,100
fruit are too small for a penetrometer

398
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,160
some of them will get crushed just by

399
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,100
the distance of penetration and

400
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,980
variation in starch has been observed in

401
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,899
wild species so I couldn't reliably use

402
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,139
starch iodine index 2.5 brightness

403
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,620
either and also sometimes the C chamber

404
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:40,019
was simply too small to accurately draw

405
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,000
gas out so

406
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,100
ethylene is still a mystery but Blue

407
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,879
Mold is not the cause of this resistance

408
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,980
or this storability

409
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,379
so from the three years of data I looked

410
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,759
at segregation ratios and

411
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,799
um they are depicted here they are

412
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,959
approximately 50 or one to one

413
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,859
segregation ratio which suggests a

414
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,958
single

415
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,839
um large effect Gene

416
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,980
which I then ran a genetic Association

417
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,019
using tassel and then R to plot the

418
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,480
results which are displayed here as a

419
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,179
Manhattan plot and you can see there's a

420
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,980
very clear and strong Peak located on

421
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,679
chromosome 10.

422
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,380
um and this p co-locates with the region

423
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,319
that has been associated with ACO

424
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,140
so to see if anything else is going on I

425
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,240
then genotyped the two parents for ACS

426
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,919
and ACO the two genes

427
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,620
um involved in the ethylene biosynthesis

428
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,679
pathway and found that in ACS both

429
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,918
parents near columnar one and pronifolia

430
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,559
where homozygous or the long storing or

431
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,620
the low ethylene producing alleles so

432
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,538
ACS does not seem to be of any effect

433
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,558
here which makes sense since we did not

434
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:56,038
see any Peak on chromosome 15. however

435
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:59,399
ACO the malice domestic parents New York

436
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:02,160
columnar one as the two low ethylene

437
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,679
producing genes but in frontifolia it

438
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,360
has one copy of the low ethylene

439
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,640
producing and one copy of the high

440
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,439
ethylene producing this means that the

441
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,080
progeny will be segregating a one-to-one

442
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,400
ratio between

443
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,500
homozygous low ethylene producing and

444
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,840
heterozygous so one copy of lung and one

445
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,380
copy or one copy of low ethylene and one

446
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:25,159
copy of high ethylene producing which

447
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,480
also validates this

448
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,460
Manhattan plot this uh genetic

449
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,440
Association

450
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,140
but I wanted to understand what was kind

451
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,500
of going on in this population or in

452
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,140
storage over time and so I outlined an

453
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,819
rna-seq experiment that used four

454
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,280
long-storm individuals which included

455
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,200
the long-storying parents and for

456
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,460
short-term individuals which included

457
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,319
the short storing parent which was

458
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,900
parnifolia

459
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,939
um and had collection dates that were

460
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,919
connected over

461
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,298
um physiological time of senescence so

462
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,700
in short storing there was three time

463
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:02,038
points that were measured a initial time

464
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,500
at Harvest a midpoint and then right

465
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,879
before senescence and then in long story

466
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,119
there was five time points that were

467
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,340
collected which had all of those plus

468
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,199
two additional Harvest Time points just

469
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,839
to further give clarification on that

470
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,460
gene expression curve and all of these

471
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,839
individuals in the study were also

472
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,419
validated with um their genotypes so the

473
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,058
short storing individuals had the

474
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,320
heterozygous genotypes that ACO and the

475
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,678
long strong individuals had the

476
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:35,359
homozygous low storing or low ethylene

477
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
producing genes at ACO

478
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,140
this is just kind of the workflow of the

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,700
rna-seq that I did it resulted in an

480
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,179
average number of breeds being over 3

481
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,759
million the percent of uniquely mapped

482
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:56,220
reads being at 81.43 percent

483
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:58,019
and I had 30 000 out of 52 000 of the

484
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,058
total annotations

485
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,160
um that were mapped to the peel so I

486
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,599
decided to take tissue samples of the

487
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,880
peel because it has been shown to be

488
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,558
more biosynthetically active than the

489
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,840
rest of the fruit during storage and

490
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,879
also the fruit tissue itself contains

491
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,859
lots of sugars which cause problems for

492
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,820
RNA extraction

493
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:20,399
um these numbers are a little bit low or

494
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:22,379
a lot of RNA sleep experiments but for a

495
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,419
three prime profiling experiment which

496
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,580
is that's what this is this is

497
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,038
sufficient to give us an idea and

498
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:31,879
indication of what is happening over

499
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,879
storage and time

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,798
so from those reads a PCA was made to

501
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:42,019
the to demonstrate the separation

502
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:45,058
between the classes and see if an

503
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:48,538
unsupervised wgcna was able to be done

504
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:49,678
so here you can see across pca1 which is

505
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,720
the bottom

506
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,200
um there's pretty good separation over

507
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,640
time so early collections mapped on the

508
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,100
right side of that chart and later

509
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,679
collections mapped on the left and then

510
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:04,199
across pca2 we can see a pretty clear

511
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,660
separation between the classes so again

512
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,700
long story individuals are blue and

513
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,080
short storing individuals are red so

514
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,960
this gave us indication that we could

515
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:16,379
use unsupervised wgcna

516
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,900
which then created this cluster charts

517
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
um the color names on the left sides of

518
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,340
these boxes don't really mean anything

519
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,939
other than names of the Clusters so you

520
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:30,119
can ignore that but

521
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,400
these are groups of eigenes that appear

522
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,859
to be associated with each other so red

523
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,080
means that the genes in the Clusters are

524
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:40,019
positively correlated with each other so

525
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:42,720
as eigen expression of them go up other

526
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,960
eigenes also go up blue is negatively

527
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,159
Associated so same pattern in Reverse

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,380
um and then

529
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,780
um and the contrast of this was between

530
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,120
the two classes so long and short and

531
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,460
the different columns here are grouped

532
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,759
so just comparing between long and short

533
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,819
individuals time which was days since

534
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,038
each a session had different storage

535
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,558
lengths because they were matched their

536
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,740
individual senescence and then time

537
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,440
Group which was the

538
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,960
0.25.5 0.75

539
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,259
and full senescence

540
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,259
discussed earlier

541
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,339
so from that

542
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,320
these clusters were then made to create

543
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,139
to demonstrate eigengine expression

544
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:30,960
patterns over time so the y-axis is the

545
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,700
modeled eigengine expression

546
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,100
um higher means higher expression lower

547
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,659
on the chart means lower expression and

548
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,000
then the x is just that time Point

549
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,919
Series so as you can see the short

550
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,599
individuals in red only have three

551
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,679
collection points and the long

552
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:48,538
individuals have five

553
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,580
and I have these two highlighted just to

554
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:53,819
demonstrate kind of what this sort of

555
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:55,500
output tells us so on the far right we

556
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:57,619
have turquoise and blue which you see

557
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,880
that the two classes appear to be

558
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:02,699
relatively similar in shape across time

559
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,799
we can assume that that is standard

560
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,179
biological process in storage and so I'm

561
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,220
not going to be looking in that cluster

562
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,919
for anything because they're both going

563
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,659
through similar expression levels and

564
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,240
then on the left side we have yellow and

565
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,880
green which have quite different levels

566
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,480
similar shapes but different

567
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,419
um

568
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,400
quantities of eigenchene expression and

569
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,220
so yellow and green might be an area

570
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,400
that I would look into for some causal

571
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,798
genes up or some Pathways of what could

572
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,380
be going on

573
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,400
foreign

574
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,500
all of the Clusters that I could

575
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,840
potentially look into the parentheses

576
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,240
indicate how many genes are located

577
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,899
inside that cluster so some are quite

578
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,720
large at um you know

579
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,519
41 000 and some are quite small at 65.

580
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,519
however we just we don't want to just

581
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,500
rely on these algorithmically decided

582
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,319
expression patterns in order to explain

583
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,119
what we're seeing so no with that

584
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,058
information and with the association

585
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,639
that I have discussed previously

586
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:07,379
um I looked into The annotation files

587
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,919
that were available for ethylene related

588
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,419
genes and I found over 300 genes and

589
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,679
that included transcription factors

590
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:19,620
Pathways signaling path repressors and

591
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,298
synthesis pathway genes from the 300

592
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,759
there were 30 that were differentially

593
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:25,859
expressed

594
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,480
in this pattern and they were

595
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:31,859
distributed across seven of those

596
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,740
previously pointed out modules and from

597
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,779
those 30 I found some of the most highly

598
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,759
um

599
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:44,099
uh differentially expressed so log folds

600
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:46,019
over 1.8 and a p-value over 0.005

601
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:49,558
and

602
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:52,558
from there I went back to this um

603
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:55,079
biosynthesis pathway and as you can you

604
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,759
can see again ACS and Eco there are the

605
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,658
ones that we have understanding about

606
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:03,558
and so I looked at ACS this again has no

607
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,179
segregation in the population and the

608
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:09,000
gene expression or the transcript

609
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,280
expression of that Gene is not

610
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,779
significantly different than

611
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,759
um between long story and short storing

612
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,038
which you would expect because there's

613
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,859
no genetic difference right

614
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:23,158
in ACO which we know there's a genetic

615
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:25,139
difference we would expect there to be

616
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,419
um a different expression but again

617
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,240
there's no significant difference

618
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,460
between the two classes however I do

619
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,099
want to point out here that the causal

620
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,440
mutation of Ace that causes the low and

621
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,500
low ethylene producing and high ethylene

622
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,019
producing phenotypes at ACO do not

623
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,599
change the transcript level it is a

624
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:49,079
functional mutation a missense mutation

625
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:52,859
that causes the protein resulting from

626
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:55,139
the transcript to function less so we

627
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,740
want to actually expect any transcriptal

628
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,380
differences at ACO so what are we going

629
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,700
to look at now because that doesn't make

630
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,200
sense anymore right

631
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,080
so

632
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,538
I looked at other Associated genes and

633
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,720
other Associated proteins and found

634
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:16,259
um this Gene Sam DC Sam is a pretty

635
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,500
ubiquitous protein in biosynthetic

636
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:22,140
Pathways and in ripening the DC is

637
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,099
decarboxylated

638
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,100
I always have to look decarboxylase

639
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:31,379
um but cmdc has been shown in ripening

640
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,918
studies to be upregulated by the

641
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:38,100
perception of ethylene so Sam is

642
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,500
increased the expression of Sam DC has

643
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:43,619
increased when the fruit or the tissue

644
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,759
is receiving ethylene and starting the

645
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:49,439
biosynthesis pathway again and here we

646
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,119
do see a significant difference between

647
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,100
the two classes where long starring

648
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,879
individuals have quite a bit less

649
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:59,459
transcription of this Sam DC

650
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,940
Gene and short storing individuals have

651
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,538
an increasing expression of it over time

652
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,820
which makes sense because in theory ACO

653
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:10,679
is

654
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:12,480
producing more ethylene in

655
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,798
short storing individuals and

656
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,538
long-strung individuals and then the

657
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:19,259
fruits are responding to this higher

658
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:21,179
ethylene concentration around them

659
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,819
so to look

660
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,679
look more into this I then looked at the

661
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,839
ethylene receptor and sensor genes which

662
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,380
do similar things they

663
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,418
um

664
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,900
sense ethylene and then start the

665
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:37,860
ethylene senescence pathway and in both

666
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,620
of these cases here we see a

667
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,119
we see a difference between short

668
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,519
storing and long strong individuals with

669
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:48,079
long story being significantly lower

670
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,079
than short storing individuals

671
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,979
and continuing on that these are

672
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,380
ethylene response factors which they are

673
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,120
genes that get turned on when the

674
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,360
senescence pathway that is controlled by

675
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,099
ethylene kind of overproduces and so

676
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:04,619
they try to repress that pathway so we

677
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:08,339
would again expect these to be higher

678
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:11,099
expressed in tissues that are sensing

679
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:13,798
increased levels of ethylene so I have

680
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:17,038
highlighted here this response Factor on

681
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,658
gene or not Gene chromosome 15. that you

682
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,940
can see a very clear difference between

683
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,278
the two types and then here on

684
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,798
chromosome 12 on the side of the screen

685
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,599
there are also two other ethylene

686
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,019
response factors

687
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:34,859
that show a difference between the two

688
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:36,900
classes of fruits and I really wanted to

689
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,000
highlight

690
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,798
um this one at the top because it the

691
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,859
long story individuals have almost no

692
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,440
transcription of this ethylene response

693
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:49,519
Factor while the short ones have

694
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,519
um transcription of it

695
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:54,418
so to kind of wrap everything up

696
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,940
together

697
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,700
um the biotic factors that I looked at

698
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:02,820
Blue molds and internal ethylene really

699
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,620
didn't give a lot of clarity but I was

700
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,798
able to map an association that

701
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,939
co-locates with the ACO region over

702
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:10,259
three years

703
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,140
position

704
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:16,558
and then when looking at the rna-seq

705
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,940
data we see that the fruit itself is

706
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:21,960
responding to an increased level of

707
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:25,919
ethylene that is caused by the ACO Gene

708
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:29,579
and that is backed up by the samdc gene

709
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,740
as well as the receptors and response

710
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,359
genes which are higher higher

711
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,880
transcribed in the short storing

712
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,719
individuals and lower transcribed in the

713
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,720
long-strung individuals

714
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,100
so before I move on and then again just

715
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,319
to reiterate

716
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:48,658
um this is of import this is of interest

717
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,960
and importance in inter-specific Reading

718
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,340
because we uh need to do some

719
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,778
inter-specific rating to interest new

720
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:56,579
traits but we don't really know what

721
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:57,898
negative traits are being brought in and

722
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,538
so this could be something that we have

723
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:02,219
to pay attention to as we do that work I

724
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:04,319
am going to try to quickly go through

725
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,899
stuff because I only have five minutes

726
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,058
um so in apple acidity is one thing that

727
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:11,939
has been researched quite intensely

728
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,980
um ma1 and ma3 are two genes that are

729
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,460
reported to control the majority of

730
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,860
malic acid accumulation in Malice ma1 is

731
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,140
reported on chromosome 16 and ma3 is on

732
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,000
chromosome 8. on the right there's a

733
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,460
very short list of

734
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,980
other genes reported to influence malic

735
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,840
acid though there is plenty more beyond

736
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,480
that I will just be talking about ma1

737
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,500
and ma3 here

738
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,480
so in this population there's quite a

739
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,640
distribution between acidity between the

740
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,860
two parents so this is data from 2021

741
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,038
though the patterns for this hold true

742
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,538
over all years observed and you can see

743
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,700
that

744
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:53,278
um New York columnar one has

745
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,600
significantly lower acidity than malice

746
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,179
per napolia

747
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,879
um co1

748
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,798
comes in at three point

749
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,179
3.27 grams per liter of titratable

750
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,960
acidity

751
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:09,000
um and prunipolia comes in at

752
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,140
24.44 grams per liter which just for

753
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,819
reference

754
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,299
um apples are kind of thought to be

755
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:17,460
somewhere between like 5 and 10 grams of

756
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:22,558
titratable acidity per liter

757
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,600
um so 150 Club New York columnar one is

758
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,639
actually significantly lower acidity

759
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,980
than kind of standard apple and then

760
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,259
printifolia is quite a bit high

761
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,480
screamingly high acid

762
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:36,480
um and all the progeny fall Within These

763
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,200
two parents every single year so great

764
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,440
candidate for genetic dissociation

765
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:48,058
because the knowledge of these two genes

766
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,399
the population was genotypes for ma1 and

767
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:51,778
klemnar one was found to be homozygous

768
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,058
dominant which would indicate that it

769
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:56,398
has a high acid phenotype which doesn't

770
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:58,200
quite make sense per napolia was found

771
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,658
to be heterozygous meaning it is one

772
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,580
high acid allele and one low acid allele

773
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:05,039
so from that we would expect a

774
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:07,740
segregation ratio of one to one of

775
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,200
homozygous dominant and heterozygous

776
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,740
however we find an actual segregation

777
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,480
ratio of 1 to 1.58 and that is due to

778
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,899
that lethality Gene that I mentioned at

779
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,899
the very beginning that is linked to ma1

780
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:24,959
if

781
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:27,178
ma3 was also genotyped and co1 was found

782
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,759
to be homozygous recessive meaning it

783
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,798
has a low acid genotype and printifolia

784
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,960
was found to be heterozygous with one

785
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,058
copy of high acid and one copy of low

786
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,340
acid and again we would expect a

787
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:41,658
segregation ratio of one to one and that

788
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,658
is what we observed in the population

789
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,360
from that I again did a genetic

790
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,600
Association using tassel and glm and

791
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:54,778
found this Peak located on chromosome 8

792
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,939
which co-locates with the ma3 region it

793
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:59,099
is interesting to report though that we

794
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,159
really don't see the peak on chromosome

795
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:05,278
16 that we would expect with ma1 we do

796
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,799
see it slightly in the pH chart but that

797
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,898
Peak is inconsistent over years and it's

798
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:12,658
never found in the tradable acidity even

799
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:14,599
over all three years and it shows up in

800
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:17,880
PH two out of three years

801
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:20,398
and I just want to point out again the

802
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:25,380
ranges of data titratable acidity goes

803
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:27,959
from 3 to 24 and pH goes from like 2.6

804
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,340
to 4.8 and so it's a lot easier to

805
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,159
create kind of false associations

806
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:33,898
without that granularity of data

807
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,760
um and so

808
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:37,678
from that

809
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,960
it's kind of it brings up the question

810
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,360
of what is going on here

811
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,700
um the primary acid in Malaga in Malice

812
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:48,000
is not like acid which we assume is

813
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,259
about 95 or upwards of 95

814
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,659
um however it's been found in wild

815
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:55,619
species that secondary acids such as

816
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:58,140
citric acid accounts for up to 60 of the

817
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,879
acid profile so to check if citric acid

818
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,480
is what's causing this wide discrepancy

819
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,480
in acidity I tried to measure citric

820
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,338
acid or the acidity profile and do

821
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,800
associations with specific acids

822
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,799
initially I tried an enzymatic assay

823
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,480
which was inconclusive I then moved to

824
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,159
hplc and in hboc I found no signal or it

825
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,619
was an unreliable signal that I could

826
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,039
not replicate from day today and so I

827
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,460
send a small subset to lulling to check

828
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,800
for or to use gcms to check for citric

829
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,139
acid and there was no citric acid signal

830
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,720
observed but there was a wide variation

831
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,899
in malic acid in the subset which kind

832
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,819
of which validates the high distribution

833
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:44,579
that I was showing earlier and also

834
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,639
accounts or informs us that the majority

835
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,199
of this acid is malic acid and we can

836
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,800
assume other acids are not really

837
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,799
playing a part

838
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,420
so like I said the acidity profile is

839
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,280
not due just these secondary acids

840
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,139
um but we know that ma3 controls the

841
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,640
majority of acid expression in this

842
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:05,098
population

843
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,779
um which kind of indicates that ma1

844
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,539
seems to be non-functioning in this

845
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,800
population or it's under repression

846
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:15,000
um New York co1 has high acid alleles

847
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,700
homozygous dominant for the high acid

848
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,320
but the lowest acid phenotype in this

849
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:22,019
entire population

850
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,599
so this is a bit outside of this

851
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,400
dissertation work but in order to

852
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,619
identify kind of what's going on or give

853
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,079
indication in conversations with Dr

854
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,000
Susan Brown she mentioned that ma3 seems

855
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,400
to control majority of

856
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,099
the acid in herberating populations and

857
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,380
so ma1 could be sequenced to identify

858
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,420
potential allelic variations that have

859
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,300
lower

860
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,740
expression or lower controls and then we

861
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,599
could identify the source of that

862
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:51,118
allelic variation to see if it's Unique

863
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,460
to the populations here or unique to

864
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,240
some of the background of one of New

865
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,240
York lumbner one

866
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,820
lastly and I'm going to try to speed

867
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,720
through this so I don't go away over

868
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,059
time

869
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,500
um fruit quality again I measured all of

870
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:06,420
these traits but I'm really only going

871
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,059
to report on fruit size

872
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,358
um today because it has a clearer story

873
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:16,019
so I measured fruit size as fruit height

874
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:19,559
fruit diameter and fruit mass and here

875
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:21,539
are the distributions for 2021 which

876
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,699
again had just the most robust data sets

877
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:26,000
so that's what I'm reporting on right

878
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,618
now and you can see again that the

879
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,099
parents are on each side of the chart

880
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:34,500
with New York lemnar one being the large

881
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,940
fruited one and prunofolia being one of

882
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,920
the smallest or the smallest in the

883
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,000
population with a distribution of

884
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,000
progeny between the two

885
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,680
so using that data I created another

886
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,880
genetic association with these three

887
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:53,098
traits and interestingly found

888
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,200
Peaks on chromosome 13 in both diameter

889
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,059
and Hypes that used

890
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,960
or the Peaks were located at the same

891
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:01,820
snip so

892
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,280
176952

893
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:08,099
and the peep that is on chromosome

894
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,720
13 in mass is very nearby the snip as

895
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,359
well

896
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,618
um this is of note because no fruit size

897
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,078
lists that have been identified on

898
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,820
chromosome 13 for Apple yet

899
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,420
um there's also been there was also

900
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,338
Peaks identified in this Association for

901
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,079
on chromosome 5 for fruit height from

902
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:28,639
zone two for fruit diameter and

903
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,640
chromosome 3 for fruit Mass

904
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:34,199
so briefly in summary I talked a lot

905
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,659
about fruit storage and what is going on

906
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,358
behind the scenes over storage time I

907
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,338
presented a wide variety in Fruit

908
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,559
acidity and genetic associations and

909
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:46,559
controls in this population and then

910
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:48,659
also presented some data on fruit size

911
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,739
and all of this together kind of tells

912
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:54,358
the story of using inter-specific

913
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:57,959
breeding in apple breeding and also

914
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:00,358
traits that could be paid attention to

915
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,760
as we're doing that and also somewhat

916
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,199
goes against the standard idea of

917
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,760
interest-specific Apple breeding which

918
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:11,759
is that all intra-specific hybrids are

919
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,220
small fruited and high in tannins high

920
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,800
in acidity low in sugar all these

921
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:19,799
negative traits and this project kind of

922
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,599
tells a story that in interspecific

923
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,480
apple breeding with careful parental

924
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,240
selection and some patience you are able

925
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,960
to really get some

926
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,459
uh decent sized and decent tasting

927
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,440
apples after one generation that could

928
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,838
be then used in future breeding with

929
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,420
some of these useful traits

930
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:40,920
I'd be remiss to not acknowledge all the

931
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,320
people that have helped in this um

932
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,480
project and in my just um in my research

933
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,660
namely Dr Susan Brown and Kevin Maloney

934
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,219
in the Apple breeding lab in Geneva who

935
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,299
um their mentorship has been invaluable

936
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:52,980
to me

937
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,320
um all of my collaborators my committee

938
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,920
members the current lab that I'm in um

939
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,599
in Geneva with Jason Londo and then the

940
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,760
great braiding lab which have been great

941
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,460
friends and collaborators and my funding

942
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,900
through polar Grant instrumental Novak

943
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,639
and then none of this happens in a

944
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,019
vacuum and so I want to thank and

945
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,460
acknowledge all of my friends and family

946
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:14,039
that have supported me through all this

947
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,338
and kept me sane as I'm staring at

948
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,380
apples for 16 hours a day and with that

949
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,539
I think I'm done and I would take any

950
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,880
questions

951
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:26,219
good question so

952
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,559
storage is a human construct it's an

953
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:31,500
article Constructor yeah in these wild

954
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:34,980
populations you're finding variation in

955
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,659
genes and impacts storage which one that

956
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,539
existed when they were evolving and so

957
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:42,179
forth so what what nature is selecting

958
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,920
for some of these differences in genetic

959
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,719
tracers shown up in stores like what

960
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,519
what's the selection pressure in nature

961
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,459
if you're looking at these Wild Spaces

962
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,139
is there like an optimal time for these

963
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,559
apples to hang on a tree before they're

964
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:58,199
consumed you know what's going on there

965
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,838
yeah I mean okay so the question is

966
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,059
um like storage is a human construct and

967
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,679
so during domestication how were these

968
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:06,599
storage related genes selected upon

969
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,699
right okay

970
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,079
um and I think the answer is they

971
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,358
weren't necessarily selected on for

972
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,000
storage they were selected for the

973
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:17,098
ethylene um senescence

974
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,338
um effects so in this population some of

975
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,920
these trees finesse on the tree and so

976
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:25,739
if you think in nature those snessing

977
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,539
rotting fruits are not very useful to

978
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:28,618
animals because they're breaking down

979
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:32,400
the sugars are breaking down the

980
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:34,800
starches are gone and so as animals were

981
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,338
consuming them they likely selected for

982
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,099
ones that did not rot immediately and

983
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:43,739
then the seeds spread and then as humans

984
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:46,859
moved them along the Silk Road probably

985
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:49,319
something more akin to storage was

986
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:51,480
selected for just movability and

987
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,400
transportation of fruits you don't want

988
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,380
your bag to be full of rotten apples and

989
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,740
so you would discard those and keep the

990
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,280
ones that stayed sound over time right

991
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,279
yeah

992
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,179
yes yeah thank you for the

993
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:09,480
representation how do you select the

994
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:12,419
storage period for how long the two in a

995
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,460
short and the long-term source so the

996
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,320
question is how were the classes defined

997
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,539
between short and long story

998
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,059
um so the long story individuals were

999
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:23,759
basically identified as saying sound and

1000
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,880
storage from Harvest which is September

1001
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,700
October until

1002
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:32,579
discard and cleaning which was April May

1003
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:34,439
so not as long as apples can be stored

1004
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:38,220
but the short storing individuals also

1005
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,019
Nest within three months of harvest and

1006
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:43,459
so there was a pretty clear separation

1007
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,460
between those two different types

1008
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,180
um it was kept at 4C so pretty standard

1009
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,559
oh that question was just what was the

1010
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,560
storage temperature

1011
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,579
just out of curiosity of the result did

1012
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:02,280
you taste any of the

1013
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,280
app oh yes I tasted almost all of them

1014
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,500
um some of them are um awful and hurt

1015
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,200
your mouth to consume as hungry can

1016
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,159
attest to and some are actually quite

1017
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:13,019
Pleasant

1018
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,299
um with pretty good texture sweetness

1019
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,579
and acidity that you know is very

1020
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,039
similar to a commercial Apple but yeah

1021
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,460
some are very high tannic and

1022
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,139
um high acidity and so they hurt

1023
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,039
oh

1024
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:32,819
bad any questions from Geneva

1025
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,559
yes a lot of questions just comments

1026
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,700
okay

1027
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:42,420
um regarding the ml1

1028
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:45,659
I think you can look at their

1029
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:49,260
um genetic effect

1030
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:52,199
on the inter

1031
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:55,619
a little interactions

1032
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:59,118
4ml went for both ml1

1033
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:59,119
and ms3

1034
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:07,559
um they are dominant gene for highest

1035
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:10,140
so in your population

1036
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:13,440
you have a homologous

1037
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:14,759
high acid for

1038
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,849
foreign

1039
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,849
[Music]

1040
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,098
yeah

1041
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,419
the other parent is you have a health

1042
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:27,059
record right

1043
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,980
right yep heterozygote

1044
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:30,130
so that means

1045
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,619
your population

1046
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,440
[Music]

1047
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:37,019
will not surrogate

1048
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:40,920
for ml1

1049
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:44,400
in terms of the in terms of

1050
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,920
in terms of their healthy levels

1051
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,318
does it controlled by that

1052
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,838
by ml1

1053
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:56,059
so that's why you don't see it

1054
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,059
you don't see the effect of email what

1055
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:00,838
okay

1056
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,358
so I mean you're saying that because of

1057
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,880
the dominant acid allele that can come

1058
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,818
from either parents that we would not

1059
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,680
see a difference in expression right not

1060
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:13,559
a lot expressions

1061
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:14,940
just a little functionality sense

1062
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,900
okay

1063
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,358
yeah we could potentially do an allele

1064
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:25,019
um expression difference with those

1065
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:28,318
yeah for the for the ma3 that's the

1066
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:30,179
perfect because you have both both of

1067
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,059
them are headed like this

1068
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:35,639
so you see it in surrogate

1069
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:39,900
and then you see the effect

1070
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:41,159
yep so that is that explain your data

1071
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,480
very well

1072
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,279
good job

1073
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,619
thank you

1074
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,599
okay we're about out of time would you

1075
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:51,180
like to hang around and I'm sure there's

1076
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,838
more things back there to eat so thank

1077
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:53,838
you all very much
