1
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:06,199
at Michigan State

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,160
University and the topic of this week's

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,878
presentation is nutrient management and

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,439
established

5
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:21,879
plantings and how to correct uh neran

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:27,000
problems once

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:31,640
uh the uh crop has been established so

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Eric I'll send it to you

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:40,359
okay happy New Year everybody um It's a

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,878
Wonderful 46 degreed sunny day in

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:47,439
central Michigan just the

12
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:51,198
typical mid uh January day for

13
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:54,839
us um so what we'll be uh covering here

14
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,799
today is uh um approaches to uh

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,160
correcting nutrient problems in existing

16
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,159
uh uh planting

17
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,359
and uh We've uh previous webinars have

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,879
covered uh topics such as the uh soil

19
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,799
characteristics and testing of soils

20
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,679
interpretation of the testing and then

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,159
uh pre-plant uh soil uh

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,840
treatments uh also uh plant tissue

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:28,320
analysis and interpretation of analysis

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,640
as well as uh uh symptoms of nutritional

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,719
uh problem so

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,840
uh that's great background for what

27
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:40,000
we'll uh uh cover uh today which is uh

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,320
what to do if uh uh a nutrient need uh

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,040
is known so I'll cover uh

30
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,718
macronutrients uh uh primarily nitrogen

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,040
is the primary concern and then go

32
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,959
through some of the micronutrients that

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,479
can become problems in the uh berries

34
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,639
and then also talk a little bit about uh

35
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:03,319
uh fertigation because I know a number

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:07,239
uh growers in different regions use

37
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,359
fertigation so let's uh first consider

38
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,000
nitrogen management so this is of course

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
important because nearly all of these

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,919
Berry crops require nitrogen on an

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,560
annual uh annual basis uh so the the big

42
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,639
question is what can you do to uh use

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,519
nitrogen efficiently and uh in that

44
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,359
regard uh there are questions about the

45
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,879
fertilizer uh type the rate the timing

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
and the pl ment of those so those are

47
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,679
the four items I'd like to go through

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,400
for uh under nitrogen

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,879
management uh first uh regarding the uh

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,000
nitrogen um uh fertilizers a lot of them

51
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,560
to uh choose from here I wanted to uh

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,039
point out uh generally those with

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,759
um the uh highest nitrogen uh contents

54
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,280
are are the cheapest per pound of

55
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,679
nitrogen

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,598
uh so those are generally the most

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,439
preferred uh sources and of course these

58
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,560
also vary in their reaction in the soil

59
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,519
so uh most of them uh certainly all of

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,239
them that um Supply nitrogen in the

61
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,360
ammonium form or combination of ammonium

62
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,400
and and nitrate tend to have an

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,319
acidifying reaction in the soil and

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,799
those that uh Supply nitrogen only as

65
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:32,639
nitrate uh have a a basic uh um reaction

66
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,000
in the soil and the uh measurement to

67
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,958
that is called the uh lime equivalent

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,400
and uh that's on the far uh right here

69
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,680
and the lime equivalent is essentially

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,120
the pounds of lime that would be

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,400
equivalent in reaction to one pound of

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,319
nitrogen supplied as a a nitrogen

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,280
fertilizer so if you were applying a

74
00:03:53,318 --> 00:04:00,000
pound of nitrogen as calcium nitrate uh

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,598
that has a positive uh uh number um and

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,519
it indicates that uh for every pound of

77
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,560
nitrogen applied as that Source uh that

78
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,319
would have equivalent reaction in the

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,000
soil of 1.3 lbs of lime so not a a bunch

80
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:17,798
of lime but it certainly over time can

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,680
affect a a pH of soils and then those

82
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,039
with negative uh numbers uh indicate

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,959
that uh you would have to add lime to

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,919
neutralize the acidity supplied by those

85
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:31,079
sources and uh we'll talk about ammonium

86
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,159
sulfate as being a great nitrogen

87
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,839
fertilizer for blueberries well one one

88
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,039
of the reasons for that is it's so

89
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,399
acidifying um for every pound of

90
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:44,719
nitrogen you supply is ammonium sulfate

91
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:48,319
uh you'd have to supply 5 pounds of of

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
lime just to neutralize the

93
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:57,319
acidity so uh choosing these uh sources

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,080
as indicated uh first cost per pound of

95
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:03,159
nitrogen uh secondly whether there a

96
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:07,079
need for additional uh nutrients so the

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,000
primary issue there is is phosphorus so

98
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,439
uh that would be a reason to choose

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,720
ammonium uh ammoniated uh phosphates uh

100
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,879
monoammonium or diammonium phosphate uh

101
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,360
whether you want to change uh soil PH in

102
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,279
which direction and then also uh

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,280
volatilization

104
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:34,439
losses so for uh blueberries the the uh

105
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:37,519
materials choice choice are um Ura if

106
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,680
the pH is uh below five so if it's below

107
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,839
five you you want to maintain it in that

108
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,519
range you'd use the less acidifying Ura

109
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,159
uh you might also choose uh uh map or

110
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:52,680
dap if phosphorus is also low then we

111
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
typically say if you if the pH is a

112
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,360
little bit high and you'd like to reduce

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,600
it somewhat then ammonium sulfate would

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,439
be the choice there and map and dap

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,479
would again be a good choices if you are

116
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,478
in need of

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,680
phosphorus for um brambles and

118
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:16,680
strawberries uh usually the cheapest

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,879
forms are are bus so Ura or ammonium

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:25,120
nitrate um are uh good uh choices there

121
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:28,879
I I know a number of Growers uh use um

122
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,478
calcium nitrate uh and there may be some

123
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,360
uh reasons for that particularly in the

124
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,279
uh middle of the summer when there's

125
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,280
some concern about uh volatilization

126
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,799
losses from uh from

127
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,279
Ura so this

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,918
volatilization uh aspect is uh um

129
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,198
something that we primarily are

130
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:53,560
concerned about with Ura and when you

131
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,560
apply uh Ura prills uh to a soil surface

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,160
the uh first uh thing that happens to

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,399
that P is hydrolysis so as it takes up

134
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,840
water

135
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:08,918
uh that small organic uh molecule of um

136
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:11,119
Ura hydrolyzes and it it produces

137
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:14,639
ammonium and

138
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,399
bicarbonate and uh important aspect of

139
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,918
this is that this uh has an immediate

140
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,560
effect of increasing the pH around that

141
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:27,959
uh pill or in the immediate

142
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,160
vicinity so if um ammonium is present uh

143
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,598
near the soil surface

144
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,160
under high pH conditions then uh it can

145
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,959
be converted to ammonia gas and lost to

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,919
the

147
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,120
atmosphere so um part of the reason this

148
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,079
is a issue with um Ura is because of

149
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,319
this pH increase that you you get

150
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:51,279
immediately after applying Ura it's not

151
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,280
to say that uh ammonium uh that's

152
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,638
applied as say ammonium sulfate uh can't

153
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:01,559
volatilize it can also but in most cases

154
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,639
pH of the oil is low enough uh to where

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,639
volatilization losses aren't a real big

156
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:14,360
deal so what um increases the potential

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:18,800
for um volatilization losses of ammonia

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,520
gas well uh first first off if the uh

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,520
Ura uh particle remains on the soil

160
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,758
surface so if you don't irrigate it in

161
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,120
or you don't receive rain for several

162
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,240
days uh then that increases potential

163
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,959
for losses if the temperatures are very

164
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,680
high so if they're above 80° then that

165
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,639
increases the potential for losing more

166
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:45,079
of the uh nitrogen in in Ura and then as

167
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:48,278
I mentioned if the soil pH is high this

168
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,959
also increases potential for losses so

169
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:55,879
in the case of blueberries where soil is

170
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:59,439
uh uh pH is is naturally uh low there's

171
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:03,919
less likelihood of losing U nitrogen in

172
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,120
in the form of uh uh ammonia gas but it

173
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,078
is something to consider in in the case

174
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,600
of strawberries in particular where we

175
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:11,120
might be fertilizing in the middle of

176
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,560
the Summer where the temperatures are

177
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,159
real hot uh you'd want to make

178
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,719
accommodations and uh for reducing uh

179
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,199
that potential and usually that that uh

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,519
means irrigating that fertilizer into

181
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,519
the soil to protect it

182
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:36,919
um nitrogen rates so uh applying the

183
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,720
proper rate is uh important as far as uh

184
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,679
uh optimizing the efficiency of nitrogen

185
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,560
used by any crop so if you apply more

186
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:48,958
than the crop is crop needs you're uh

187
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,679
going to have a lower uh use efficiency

188
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,599
and you may cause other problems as well

189
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,599
so rates uh vary from from state to

190
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,200
state and region to region and certainly

191
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,920
due to uh different soil types and what

192
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,120
I

193
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,958
have here is just a general range for

194
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,039
nitrogen rates uh starting for with

195
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:11,679
blueberries so you can see that uh uh we

196
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:15,439
start with one or twoy old uh fields at

197
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:18,519
15 to 20 pounds of actual per acre and

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,320
then that's just ramped up over time and

199
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,959
then by the time you get to a mature uh

200
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,600
uh field you might be applying between

201
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:32,239
70 and 40 pounds of actual nitrogen to

202
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,959
the acre and the rates uh here depend

203
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,360
primarily on the soil type so the

204
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,078
sandier the soil lower the organic

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,919
content of the soil the higher rate you

206
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,919
would uh U probably

207
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,440
need um nitrogen rates for uh

208
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:53,319
brambles uh here U again starting

209
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,959
somewhat lower rate uh 20 to 40 lounds

210
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:01,000
the first year up to 30 to 60 lbs the

211
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:04,359
second year and then up to 50 to 100 lb

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,958
in the thirdy year and um and older

213
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,600
plantings so again the higher rates

214
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,199
would be applied on sandier uh soils and

215
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,480
there's some indication that uh fall

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,160
bearing uh raspberries uh would require

217
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,959
higher rates than say summer bearing

218
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,600
raspberries and I think this makes a

219
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,039
little bit of sense if you consider

220
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,440
those poor plants are cut down to the

221
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,240
ground each spring they're generating a

222
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,040
whole new stand of canes as well as

223
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,919
producing a cra of fruit all in one uh

224
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:37,078
one season so Growers particularly on

225
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,759
Sandy or ground will find that uh rates

226
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:43,919
even as high as 100 pounds may be uh

227
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,919
optimizing yield for fall bearing

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
raspberries uh strawberries again these

229
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,039
rates vary somewhat from region to

230
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,560
region but generally we we think about

231
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:57,559
40 to 60 pounds of nitrogen uh to the

232
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:01,399
acre during the planting year and then

233
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:04,000
50 to 100 PB per acre during the uh uh

234
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,120
production years so

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,480
um these rates again are going to be

236
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,720
highest on the on the sandier

237
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,399
soils so uh a little bit about rates but

238
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,639
how about timing um I think timing is a

239
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,159
critical Factor as far as trying to

240
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:28,600
optimize efficiency of nitrogen use and

241
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:32,480
in in Michigan we we feel that um a good

242
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,079
system would be to apply um fertilizer

243
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,480
in a split application so half of it

244
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:42,239
going on um about uh bed bud swell time

245
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,959
before Bloom and then the second half of

246
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,278
it going on at uh uh during pedal fall

247
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,359
um uh perhaps 3 weeks later and what

248
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:55,000
this

249
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,720
uh typically does uh for us is uh

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,559
provides uh nitrogen available to the

251
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:05,480
plants during the uh early uh rapid

252
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,638
growth flush from petal fall through gr

253
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,600
green uh uh

254
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,600
fruit and then the second application

255
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,079
later in the season tends to maintain

256
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,759
adequate levels through the Harvest

257
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:23,198
period uh so you may find that it makes

258
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,319
no difference if you apply uh nitrogen

259
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,879
in one application or two

260
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,160
applications if you're on a heavier soil

261
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,759
or a soil high in organic content but I

262
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,439
think you'll find uh benefits from the

263
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:41,439
split application uh system particularly

264
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,440
on the sandier uh sand or

265
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,399
sites and then the other um point I

266
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,040
wanted to make that you're probably

267
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,480
aware of is that if you're growing

268
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:58,078
blueberries in uh cold uh locations

269
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:00,759
where Winter injury is a is a concern

270
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:05,319
then applying nitrogen uh later than

271
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:07,919
June is uh is uh should be avoided and

272
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,399
the reason is it tends to reduce the

273
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,360
hardiness of the bushes going into the

274
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,759
winter uh so um if you're

275
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,600
growing hearty blueberries in a less U

276
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,839
stressful uh winter uh location then you

277
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,800
might be able to get by with applying

278
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,519
nitrogen a little bit later in the

279
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:32,719
season but if you're growing blueberries

280
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:35,078
where you're just um uh stressed by the

281
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,000
winter year after year then this is

282
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:40,719
where you want to be real careful about

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,919
applying nitrogen or maintaining high

284
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,120
levels of available nitrogen later in

285
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,120
the season

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,440
little bit about timing on brambles um

287
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,680
here I what I would suggest is um if

288
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,839
you're growing on heavier uh fertile

289
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,638
soils uh probably do just as well

290
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:25,440
applying all your fertilizer at about

291
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:29,360
Bud break time in April or May um if

292
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,880
you're uh growing on Sandy ground uh

293
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,879
that's low in organic matter then you

294
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,639
might go to this split application

295
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,639
approach where you're applying half at

296
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,600
about Bud break and then half uh 3 to

297
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,278
four weeks later um I think this will

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,159
maintain levels of nitrogen available to

299
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,600
the plants later into the growing season

300
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:55,318
and particularly with fall Fring types

301
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,839
uh um support uh fruit Production Way

302
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,838
out into September and October

303
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:14,278
timing for uh perennial strawberries so

304
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:17,318
um here U recommendations vary from the

305
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:20,000
planting year versus uh uh fruiting

306
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:23,159
years but during the planting year what

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,559
we' typically recommend is uh 20 to 40

308
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,719
lbs of nitrogen 2 to 3 weeks after

309
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,919
planting uh you want to make sure that

310
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,920
this is delayed uh to where either

311
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:38,240
irrigation or rain has settled the soil

312
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,399
around the plants and then a second

313
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,680
application uh in

314
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,360
August so that would be uh during uh

315
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,919
planting

316
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,800
year

317
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:53,360
during during a fruiting year uh uh

318
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,719
things change somewhat so here we're

319
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,800
recommending uh applications of 30 to 50

320
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,680
pounds of nitrogen

321
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,318
applied at at uh renovation time after

322
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:08,318
harvest and then about the same amount

323
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,678
of nitrogen applied in late August or

324
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,119
early

325
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,880
September um there are

326
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,798
some some growers in uh Michigan I know

327
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
that feel that they need just a little

328
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:23,959
bit of

329
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,000
nitrogen uh early in the spring of a

330
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,600
fruiting year and by little bit I mean

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,359
just 10 pounds or so if they're growing

332
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,918
on very Sandy ground um this is I I

333
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,678
think kind of a a risky thing to do

334
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,360
because you can generate too much

335
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,919
vegetation by by uh fertilizing in in

336
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,719
the spring but if over time you find

337
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,320
that that works for you on your soil

338
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,319
then that might be a a good approach as

339
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:59,119
well um and then lastly nitrogen

340
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:02,679
placement so uh the issues uh here are

341
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,759
really a balance between trying to put

342
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,759
the fertilizer where it's available to

343
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:11,119
the plant versus not concentrating the

344
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:15,879
fertilizer so much that you create a a

345
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:18,038
salt issue uh and injure the plants so

346
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,960
with blueberries what would be a good

347
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:23,079
approach

348
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,079
is to U with young plants so in the

349
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:29,839
first or second year apply in a either

350
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:33,558
twoot two to 3ft wide uh circle around

351
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:37,480
each plant by hand or in a 3 to 4T wide

352
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,480
band uh down down the

353
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,679
row um since these uh bushes are usually

354
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,280
at a 10-ft row spacing if you're

355
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,159
broadcasting fertilizer over the entire

356
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,158
surface uh that's very

357
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,279
inefficient as the uh bushes mature you

358
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,558
can imagine that the root system of

359
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:03,000
these old bushes uh uh probably

360
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:05,759
intertwines in between the uh um in

361
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,720
between the rows so here I don't think

362
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,679
you get much Advantage from uh banding

363
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,079
any fertilizer within the row and it's

364
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:20,080
uh certainly easier to just broadcast a

365
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,079
fertilizer in older established uh uh

366
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,558
plantings and we talked a little bit

367
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:30,759
about the salt index in the earlier

368
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:34,960
webinar uh so this is a a measure of um

369
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,879
the uh potential for causing salt stress

370
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,000
uh to

371
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,280
plants uh and I again wanted to

372
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,119
reiterate that uh you often see these uh

373
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,279
salt index uh values for different

374
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,918
fertilizers and if you consider these

375
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:53,119
only then you you'd uh steer away from

376
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,000
ammonium nitrate for example that has a

377
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,879
very high salt index and a high

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,798
potential for causing injury and you

379
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,840
might uh look um more closely at calcium

380
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,558
nitrate for example that has a lower

381
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,000
salt index

382
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:13,960
value but these these values are based

383
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,880
on uh U units of actual fertilizer so if

384
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,279
you're um um working in the field of

385
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,000
course you're you're thinking about um

386
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,440
I'm going to apply for example 50 pounds

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,119
of nitrogen what's the best source of

388
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,919
that well if you're using ammonium

389
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:31,918
nitrate that's higher in nitrogen

390
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,400
uh you would use less of that material

391
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,679
and uh so this last column is the salt

392
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,759
index uh uh per unit of nitrogen and you

393
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,480
can see that uh numbers uh flip-flop so

394
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,759
ammonium nitrate might actually be more

395
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,759
uh safe to use on on younger plants than

396
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:54,440
uh calcium nitrate another um aspect of

397
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,759
this of course is it's easier to hand

398
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,960
apply um more diluted fertilizers such

399
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,960
as calcium nit than than ammonium

400
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,200
nitrate uh nitrogen uh placement and

401
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,080
brambles kind of the similar uh thinking

402
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:21,038
here as with the the blueberri

403
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:24,000
so during the first year um you'd be

404
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:28,119
either uh applying it in a circle around

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,159
each plant or again in a band um down

406
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,119
each

407
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,320
uh in established plantings you're kind

408
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,038
of to the situation where um you might

409
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,798
be a little bit more efficient by

410
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,798
applying that in a band under the row

411
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,798
but in most cases Growers are trying to

412
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:47,278
maintain a sod between the rows so in

413
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,519
order to fertilize the sod and fertilize

414
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:54,798
The Raspberries it might be a better

415
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,798
choice to to broadcast under those uh uh

416
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,679
circumstances and then nitrogen

417
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,880
placement in uh uh strawberries and

418
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,880
perennial

419
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,640
strawberries um again during the

420
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,240
planting year um generally probably

421
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,600
broadcasting fertilizer because of the

422
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,240
close row spacing I guess you could

423
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:18,599
consider uh banding in a smaller uh

424
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,798
planting and certainly uh broadcasting

425
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,798
uh when the plants are

426
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,720
mature ER Eric there's two questions on

427
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,520
timing

428
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,880
uh that we have uh one was from Kathy

429
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,519
and I think Kathy you might have to jump

430
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,840
in to clarify uh what you were looking

431
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,839
at there and then

432
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,319
uh yeah Eric I was wondering when you

433
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,759
said

434
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,639
um nitrogen and blueberry shouldn't be

435
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,919
applied after June if that was the

436
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,840
middle of June the end of June I was

437
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,840
hoping you to clarify that just a little

438
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,880
thanks just as a rule of thumb i' I'd

439
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,240
say no fertilizer after the 1 of July so

440
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,960
um make sure everything goes on um

441
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,159
before

442
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:17,000
July and I'm looking for the box of

443
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:20,120
U other questions was was there another

444
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,119
question besides that

445
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:29,959
Kathy yes it's in the chat

446
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,080
box is it in chat go ahead Dan

447
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,038
go ahead

448
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:37,158
Dan yeah Eric it's it's in theuh chat

449
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:40,119
box our folks over in oid County wanted

450
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:43,679
to know what's the right timing uh for

451
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,678
nitrogen and everbearing

452
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,240
strawberries yeah uh everbearing

453
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,360
strawberries I haven't had a whole lot

454
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:56,400
of experience with uh but typically um

455
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,000
you're those are on plastic um so you're

456
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,798
fertig gating and the

457
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,038
uh timing uh there uh would be um more

458
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:07,278
of a spoon feeding approach through the

459
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,200
uh growing

460
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,119
season uh I think what there's some real

461
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,240
good information from uh North Carolina

462
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,239
State

463
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,798
University uh for plastic culture

464
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,319
strawberry systems and I think I'd uh

465
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,759
suggest you uh take a look at that uh

466
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:29,278
information but in general you you're

467
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:33,079
trying to uh grow a canopy uh throughout

468
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:36,079
the uh season and then to maintain uh

469
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:39,839
fruiting uh for extended period of of

470
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:42,798
time uh if it's the first uh planting

471
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,839
year on uh ever bearing strawberries

472
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,000
then you're fruiting from August

473
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,599
September and October so that's a long

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,519
period of time you need to supply uh

475
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,519
nutrition uh during that time and then

476
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,079
typically under our conditions uh

477
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:00,839
Growers are trying to overwinter those

478
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:04,199
uh beds uh for fruiting the following uh

479
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:07,158
spring as well uh so if you're F I would

480
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,319
assume if you fertilize them well uh

481
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,919
through the previous uh year that you

482
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:16,639
probably would not require too much in

483
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,679
the spring prior to that uh that uh um

484
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,759
June June

485
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,759
cropping I hope that uh that answers

486
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,759
that

487
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:37,079
and then there are um wanted to mention

488
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:40,479
organic sources of uh of

489
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,759
nitrogen uh and we talked about this a

490
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,880
little bit in the previous uh webinar

491
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,798
but there are a number of uh materials

492
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,679
um that to choose from here a number of

493
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,639
uh uh different plant product and Animal

494
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,880
product uh materials so soy meal cotton

495
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,000
seed meal blood meal fish meal

496
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,159
those are relatively high in

497
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,640
nitrogen and they release and make

498
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,480
available a relatively high

499
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,159
percentage of nitrogen content during

500
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,240
the first

501
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:19,039
year um if you're using U Manu uh these

502
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,919
uh as we mentioned before should be

503
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:25,839
analyzed before you're using those but

504
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,440
uh typically they contain lower nitrogen

505
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:32,439
concentrations and and and release a

506
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,399
lower percentage of nitrogen to the crop

507
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:39,440
during the course of the first year and

508
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:41,879
then composts of course are um aged and

509
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,240
decomposed uh usually plant

510
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,159
materials uh they contain uh lower

511
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,359
nitrogen concentrations as a result and

512
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,880
they tend to be somewhat stable because

513
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,599
they're aged and they tend to release a

514
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,360
lower percentage of their nitrogen

515
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,798
during the course of the first uh season

516
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,678
so those are generalities but I think

517
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,359
good rule of thumb is these products

518
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,399
with higher nitrogen contents usually

519
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,678
mineralize uh higher uh percentages of

520
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:15,199
the nitrogen uh during the course of the

521
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,840
first year and then uh any uh compost or

522
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,038
aged manures for example uh tend to be

523
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,439
more stable and tend to mineralize and

524
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:28,079
make available lower percentages of the

525
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,080
nitrogen during the course of one year

526
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:41,480
uh a question U is it risky using

527
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:45,079
um uh fresh manure and that's a a great

528
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,798
comment so um during uh production uh

529
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:52,720
years if you're using fresh manure this

530
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:57,000
should go on the the year prior uh after

531
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,679
harvest and in some with some uh crops

532
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,839
blueberries and particular uh some

533
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,720
marketers would advise no fresh manure

534
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:06,720
ever being used in uh uh

535
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,640
plantings thanks for that link uh

536
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,079
Dan um we've done a little bit of work

537
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,798
with nitrogen release from organic

538
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,879
organic sources and organic blueberries

539
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,720
in Michigan and I wanted to show you

540
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,399
some of those data just because they

541
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,120
illustrate kind of the release pattern

542
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:45,918
for some of these uh organic uh

543
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:48,038
fertilizers so um these are um same

544
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:53,080
material but two different rates so this

545
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:54,720
M's uh soy based uh uh 811 organic

546
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,038
fertilizer was

547
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,759
applied

548
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:06,759
um on May 10th and then we simply uh uh

549
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,960
watched the total inorganic nitrogen so

550
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,558
the ammonium and the nitrate levels and

551
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,960
the soil profile uh after application so

552
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,798
you can see that the uh there was a

553
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,319
pretty immediate uh release of available

554
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:24,240
nitrogen uh and it tended to decline as

555
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:27,599
the season progressed but particularly

556
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,679
at the higher rate uh there was still um

557
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:35,319
elev level of available nitrogen um in

558
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,960
the U middle to end of September during

559
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,319
this um study uh so there were no

560
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,840
differences in nitrogen levels in the

561
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,759
blueberry uh uh bushes but it does

562
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,720
illustrate that uh these uh at least

563
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:54,079
this material tends to release nitrogen

564
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,640
on a gradual uh basis uh that tends to

565
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:00,319
um mimic I think pretty closely the

566
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
nitrogen Demand by by the

567
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,720
blueberries and here here are some other

568
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,159
uh similar data from a different

569
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Blueberry field so here we just use one

570
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,720
rate of this particular nitrogen

571
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,320
fertilizer and it was applied at this uh

572
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,558
point in time and you can see that

573
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:23,960
immediately there was a increase in

574
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:26,960
available uh nitrogen um uh from the

575
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,519
fertilizer uh levels declined but again

576
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,960
even uh Wards the end of September uh

577
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:36,440
levels in the soil were uh elevated over

578
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:41,000
um plats with receiving no fertilizer at

579
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,480
all uh so this um presents a little bit

580
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,759
of a concern about how you fertilize

581
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,640
organic blueberries uh without um

582
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,640
elevating uh levels of available

583
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,519
nitrogen uh late in the season when we

584
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,720
would like those plants to be slowing

585
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,200
down and getting ready for for winter

586
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,079
and we've seen in two of these trials uh

587
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,480
increase in the uh level of Bud damage

588
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:12,638
during the winter uh because I think of

589
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,200
this elevated levels available nitrogen

590
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,199
later in the

591
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:31,079
season the uh uh use of potassium so so

592
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,639
uh here uh most of these crops have a

593
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:36,720
fairly high demand for potassium and uh

594
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:38,119
Fields often require regular

595
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,600
applications of

596
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:45,439
potassium uh perhaps not annually but uh

597
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:49,000
um often on a regular uh

598
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,240
basis and the fertilizer uh choices

599
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,480
really should be based on of course

600
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:58,880
whether you're growing conventionally

601
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,120
organic uh the cost per unit of uh k2o

602
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
uh whether you need other uh nutrients

603
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,518
that might be in the fertilizer and then

604
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,360
a potential hazard from chloride so I'll

605
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,960
talk a little bit about that so um the

606
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,798
cost per unit is cheapest for potassium

607
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,480
chloride potassium sulfate is somewhat

608
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:20,720
higher uh

609
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,960
cost and potassium magnesium sulfate or

610
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:29,120
soal mag is even higher uh costs per

611
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,120
unit of uh potassium

612
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,918
the uh potential problems with potassium

613
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,679
chloride or muriate is that it contains

614
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:42,320
chloride which in High Enough

615
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:46,278
concentrations can uh damage um uh Berry

616
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:50,678
crops organic sources there are organic

617
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:53,558
sources of Soom mag um of pottassium

618
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,399
sulfate as well this is a different

619
00:32:53,558 --> 00:33:00,519
material than than this in that it's

620
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,839
apparently less processed so it's a um

621
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:06,960
usable organically and then of course

622
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:09,959
wood ash contains a fair amount of uh uh

623
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,600
potassium but it's very alkaline so if U

624
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,038
if that's being used in blueberries in

625
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:18,359
particular um it would have uh effect of

626
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,359
increasing soil

627
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:29,038
PH so rates of pottassium uh for

628
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:31,158
existing plantings uh usually uh if a

629
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,599
deficiency

630
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:38,120
exists 100 to 200 pounds of k2o per acre

631
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,918
will correct uh those uh

632
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:43,000
shortages uh Growers over time that find

633
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,240
that they need maintenance applications

634
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,839
of potassium find that 50 to 100 lb per

635
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,159
acre is is adequate to do that

636
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:55,240
job the timing uh isn't as critical as

637
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,919
it is with nitrogen because uh partly

638
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,278
because uh potassium moves in the the

639
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,399
soil but much more slowly than nitrogen

640
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:05,200
so getting it on at the right time is

641
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,118
not so critical one point I'd make is

642
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,159
that fall applications would be uh

643
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:14,079
preferred if you're using the cheaper

644
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,159
Myriad of poach um so that that would

645
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
allow more time for chloride to leech

646
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,079
out of the root Zone before plants begin

647
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,200
growing in the the following spring and

648
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,639
it certainly would be the case if you

649
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,279
were applying a relatively High rate of

650
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,838
of potassium say 100 pound of k2o or

651
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,879
higher uh and you wanted to use muriate

652
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,320
uh that would certainly be best applied

653
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:40,078
in the

654
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,720
fall uh keep in mind that excessive use

655
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,720
of pottassium can cause magnesium

656
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,000
shortages so I think Marvin covered this

657
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,039
pretty well uh previously in that

658
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
there's a balance between the cats and

659
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,000
soils calcium magnesium and pottassium

660
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,560
and if you continually apply pottassium

661
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:05,919
uh because you think that you uh need it

662
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:09,000
every year you can cause trouble uh with

663
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,880
inadequate uh uh availability of

664
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,199
magnesium to the

665
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,400
plants uh there's a question how late in

666
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:19,559
the fall can you apply

667
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,039
potassium uh it's like I say it is going

668
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:26,199
to stay in the root Zone uh over um

669
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,159
quite a few months uh so I you could

670
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,598
apply it uh um

671
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,319
anytime in the late fall uh that

672
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,320
potassium should be available to the

673
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,880
plants the following uh

674
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,440
spring and the potassium uh fall

675
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,760
application would allow this uh time for

676
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,760
chloride to leech out of the

677
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,559
Zone phosphorus sources uh nothing real

678
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,559
striking here there are a number of

679
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:58,639
different materials to choose

680
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:01,759
from conventionally they all uh are very

681
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:06,358
highly soluble and uh highly available

682
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,839
uh to uh Berry crops if you have a need

683
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:13,598
for phosphorus then the um ammoniated

684
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:17,960
phosphates would be um good choices but

685
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,800
if you're only interested in uh uh

686
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,400
phosphate uh then these are expensive

687
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,800
sources of

688
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,599
them for organic uh producers uh bone

689
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,039
meal fish meal are good uh sources uh

690
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,720
Rock phosphate isn't used too much uh

691
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:38,480
but I mentioned it because

692
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:41,279
in um very acidic uh soils such as

693
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,838
blueberry soils the solubility is uh

694
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,319
quite a bit higher uh so it might be a

695
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:50,358
reasonable source of phosphate uh for

696
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:53,559
blueberries where the acidic uh uh soil

697
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:56,559
PH uh increases the solubility of the

698
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,559
material

699
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,079
uh question about um a good question

700
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,599
common question about the use of

701
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,039
pottassium in the

702
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:13,838
um in the fall as an antifreeze or to

703
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:13,838
increase the hardiness of uh

704
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,880
bushes and I haven't seen any uh data to

705
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,119
support that I I heard it from a number

706
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,960
of blueberry growers in particular and

707
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,318
there are some growers in Michigan that

708
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,880
actually apply fer applications of

709
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:36,559
potassium in the fall uh thinking that

710
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,358
it helps to slow down the bushes and get

711
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,519
them ready for winter uh it that may be

712
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,838
true but I can't say there's any

713
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:47,639
scientific evidence that that's true

714
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:51,039
something that probably is worth uh uh

715
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,598
investigating and I um along those lines

716
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,759
I think if if you're working with

717
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:58,760
Growers and um that a question comes up

718
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,160
or a grower indicates that do this and

719
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:05,680
it uh does good for me uh you might

720
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:08,519
suggest to them uh to leave some

721
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:11,480
untreated check areas so that they can

722
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:14,679
actually learn uh what the treatment did

723
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,679
versus what they think it

724
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:25,800
did U magnesium and

725
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,000
calcium um here uh

726
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,760
sources vary from magnesium sulfate

727
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,719
epson salts calcium sulfate or

728
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,960
gypsum um potassium magnesium

729
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,480
sulfate uh and then calcitic or

730
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,119
dolomitic

731
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,440
lime so typically at least under our

732
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,680
soil conditions in Michigan if if we're

733
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,280
low in

734
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:55,039
magnesium indoor uh calcium it nearly

735
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,720
always IND uh indicates that the pH is

736
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:02,880
too low uh so the the uh correction

737
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:06,358
would be to apply either calcitic or

738
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,039
dolomitic lime under our conditions uh

739
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:12,159
there we tend to have U more of an

740
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:15,279
abundance of calcium relative to

741
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,679
magnesium in the soil so dolomitic lime

742
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,480
usually is a better choice but the soil

743
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:25,039
tests will tell you

744
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,880
that if the pH uh is appropriate then a

745
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:31,000
source of uh calcium might be EP some

746
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,880
Epsom salts or Soo mag would be good

747
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,318
sources of magnesium but like I say I I

748
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,119
think that's fairly uncommon to see uh

749
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:46,119
very low levels of magnesium or calcium

750
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,119
in a soil with a proper pH

751
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:11,598
calcium and fruit quality is um

752
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,440
something that generates a whole lot of

753
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,318
um attention and interest and for good

754
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,960
reason because uh elevated uh calcium

755
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:23,239
concentrations in Fruit tissue are often

756
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,358
associated with improved quality and

757
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:30,959
quality is such such an important uh uh

758
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,239
variable in in uh Berry Crop Production

759
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,519
so we know

760
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:39,399
uh for example that uh there's a reduced

761
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:43,039
incidence of some physiological

762
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,519
disorders of fruits uh if uh calcium

763
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,800
levels can be increased so bitter pit uh

764
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:54,000
is a localized deficiency of calcium in

765
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:57,800
in apple fruit uh so that's a um a fruit

766
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,358
quality related uh aspect we know that

767
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,079
uh there's an increase in firmness uh

768
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:07,318
usually that accompanies increase in in

769
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:10,519
Fruit calcium concentration so this may

770
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:13,599
uh relate to the inhibitory effect of

771
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:16,280
calcium on some of the natural enzymes

772
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,680
in in fruit that are associated with the

773
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,480
softening and degradation of cell walls

774
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:26,279
and the natural syence of of fruit so

775
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,679
calcium has a direct effect there and

776
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,640
then U there's also a reduction in a rot

777
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:35,598
that's caused by several fungal

778
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:39,000
pathogens and this may also go back to

779
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,160
the inhibitory effect of high calcium uh

780
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,760
concentrations on some of those enzymes

781
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:49,358
that originate from the Fungus uh that

782
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,960
contribute to breakdown of the of the

783
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,318
tissue so all good reasons to think

784
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,199
about uh calcium applications for

785
00:41:54,318 --> 00:42:02,119
improving uh Berry quality but what's no

786
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:04,719
known there well um we know that in

787
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,720
increas in calcium levels and berries uh

788
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:10,039
can improve the the quality of berries

789
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,279
and we know that from uh the fact that

790
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:15,920
if you dip um uh strawberries or

791
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,920
blueberries and calcium uh Solutions

792
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,440
after harvest that increases firmness

793
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,358
and it um Andor it incre reduces uh the

794
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,440
rot incidence and of course dipping

795
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,799
these berries in solutions that doesn't

796
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,440
have much commercial utility because it

797
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,000
uh has quality issues in its uh in

798
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,480
itself but it does illustrate that if

799
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,119
you had ways of increasing calcium

800
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,760
concentrations in the in the berries uh

801
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,880
you'd probably see some benefit from it

802
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,920
so um the most likely approach to

803
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,000
increasing calcium levels in the berries

804
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,599
is to spray the plants with uh calcium

805
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,838
sprays uh prior to harvest and uh

806
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,280
there's been a number of studies in

807
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,358
different parts of the world on on these

808
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:07,760
three uhu groups of berries blueberries

809
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:10,000
and strawberries and and uh brambles and

810
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,680
uh calcium sprays have uh sometimes

811
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
increased firmness um and prolonged the

812
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:19,480
shelf life of berries Andor reduce

813
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,039
petritis uh rot but I think the most

814
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,240
consistent thing about uh these studies

815
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:28,000
is the inconsistency so these effects

816
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:31,199
are seen sometimes uh and they're not

817
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,679
seeing other times so this is another

818
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:37,439
one where there's no clear um answer for

819
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:40,078
Growers i' advise people if they're

820
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,079
interested in uh working with calcium

821
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,960
sprays again go back to that um rule of

822
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,800
thumb try try to make sure that you're

823
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,679
leaving untreated areas so that you can

824
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,920
tell whether your your treatment

825
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,919
actually did did some good

826
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,599
um another approach of course to

827
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:05,318
increasing levels of calcium in the um

828
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,559
berries would be to supply it through

829
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:09,719
the roots so um this also hasn't been

830
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,920
particularly

831
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:17,078
effective uh these are some um data uh

832
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,480
that we collected on a low calcium

833
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,440
blueberry soil uh years ago in in

834
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,599
Michigan so we we selected the site

835
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,000
because it was low in calcium

836
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,480
and then we applied uh either 1,000 lb

837
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,239
of lime or 500 lb of gypsum each year

838
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,480
for a number of years and you can see

839
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:41,039
that this had a very dramatic effect

840
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,280
particularly with the application of

841
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:48,199
lime of increasing the calcium

842
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:52,200
concentrations in the um in the soil uh

843
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:54,960
somewhat lesser U degree with the the

844
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,960
use of

845
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,719
gypsum uh but what we found from a

846
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:05,318
quality standpoint is that these modest

847
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:07,799
rates of lime and gypsum raise the pH in

848
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:10,400
calcium levels of the soil but had

849
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,280
inconsistent effects on um on the leaf

850
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,200
calcium levels and in two years when we

851
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,400
measured them had no effect on fruit

852
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:21,279
calcium levels so they seem to get

853
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,800
calcium somewhat into the plant uh but

854
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,480
they did not get uh Elevate calcium

855
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,440
levels in the fruit themselves which is

856
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,199
where we we want it and the treatments

857
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,358
as a real result had no effect on fruit

858
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:37,078
yield or shelf life or the

859
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:40,078
firmness so I I thought this was a good

860
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,839
test to talk about here because it was

861
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,359
in a field that was low in calcium to

862
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:48,358
begin with and over time we were able to

863
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,480
pretty dramatically increase calcium

864
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:54,719
levels in in the soil but this had

865
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,559
pretty minor effects if any on uh uh

866
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,199
calcium levels in the uh um in the

867
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,079
plants and particularly in the in the

868
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,078
fruit where you'd like

869
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:12,759
it Boron is

870
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:16,640
a interesting um micronutrient uh and it

871
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,200
can uh become deficient in uh Berry

872
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,879
crops uh generally if there's a shortage

873
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,919
it causes uh poor shoe growth and die

874
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,720
back or reduced uh fruit set or

875
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,318
sometimes fruit deformities so these uh

876
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,799
blueberry pictures were supplied by a

877
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:37,480
colleague in in Italy where they were

878
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:41,280
working with a um Elliot site and it uh

879
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,679
U was extremely low in leaf Boron levels

880
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,720
down to 8 to 10 parts per million uh

881
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:50,719
they had these uh lesions developing on

882
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:53,399
some of the uh uh fruit these Corky

883
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:56,879
lesions and those were corrected by

884
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,880
Boron applications

885
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,318
um there was a question is there a

886
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,838
synergistic effect of

887
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:14,960
calcium on nitrate upake when applied as

888
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:17,358
calcium nitrate and I that's a good

889
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,079
question and I I don't know as I have a

890
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:24,239
good answer uh to it uh so um calcium

891
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,440
nitrate of course uh because you're

892
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:30,838
applying only nitrate uh

893
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,079
can be uh uh relatively efficient if

894
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,519
it's not leeched out of the root Zone uh

895
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,960
quickly or it may be very inefficient if

896
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:42,039
uh if you're irrigating heavily after

897
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,400
applications or you receive a 2 or three

898
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,920
inch rain after application that will

899
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,960
remove it all um and I don't know that

900
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:57,519
of any specific effects of calcium on

901
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,519
uptake of uh of nitrate in particular

902
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,280
getting back to Boron though uh I wanted

903
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,960
to mention that berries like most crops

904
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,960
are very sensitive to excessive Boron so

905
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,000
um application should be made only if a

906
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,159
soil soil or Leaf analysis indicate a

907
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,440
need uh so applying Boron because

908
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:25,118
somebody told you that uh it may correct

909
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,440
deform berries is a a poor approach if

910
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:31,720
you don't have a data on Boron levels in

911
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,760
the soil and more importantly in the uh

912
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:37,078
in the

913
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:39,280
leaves uh if there is a need uh that's

914
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,240
easy to get Boron into these crops

915
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,000
either through fure

916
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:47,759
applications uh applied in early in the

917
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,119
uh season uh to the foliage or through

918
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,960
uh sprays uh to the ground in the spring

919
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:58,519
that could be applied with a a a weed

920
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:03,119
spray or even soil applications of

921
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:03,119
granulated material in the in the

922
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,440
spring iron uh deficiencies occur

923
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,760
periodically but these are nearly always

924
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,440
related to a pH that's too high so uh

925
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,359
most common occurrence of course is in

926
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,480
blueberries where the pH if the pH is

927
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:26,039
above about 5.5 under our conditions we

928
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,480
start to see this chlorosis due to iron

929
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:29,119
uh deficiency

930
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:35,960
or

931
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:38,720
U uh occasionally uh in um Bramble or uh

932
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:42,280
Strawberry Fields if pH is very high you

933
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:45,598
can get the similar uh symptoms so the

934
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:50,559
the problem is really related to um

935
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:54,400
effect of um pH and uh dropping the pH

936
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:58,359
is only um good solution to it there are

937
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:02,000
a number of folar uh iron chelated

938
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:05,759
products available and those do

939
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,159
um provide some Leaf Greening uh if

940
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,240
they're applied to affected bushes but I

941
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:14,239
question whether you really see

942
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:15,879
Improvement in the Vigor um from those

943
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,798
treatments I think sometimes it's more

944
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,798
of a cosmetic

945
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,798
effect uh manganese uh this is another

946
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,000
micronutrient that uh where uh

947
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:30,679
deficiencies can occur in berries in the

948
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,519
Midwest and from what I read They're

949
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:35,358
they're probably even less common in the

950
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:39,838
in the

951
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:44,400
Northeast and partly because it again is

952
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:47,679
usually uh pH related so if the pH is

953
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:51,400
too high this limits solubility of

954
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:55,279
Manganese and um can cause deficiencies

955
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:58,960
of magnesium of maganese and the reason

956
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:02,400
that uh uh blueberries of course um

957
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:06,400
seldom run into manganese uh deficiency

958
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,200
is that uh uh pH is slow so it uh

959
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,599
increases availability of that

960
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:16,480
micronutrient so if um there's a need

961
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:20,599
for manganese check pH and reduce it uh

962
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,719
if there's um if it's too high or ful or

963
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:27,240
sprays of Manganese sulfate uh manganese

964
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:30,519
keates uh can be used some

965
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,519
U fungicides contain significant amounts

966
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:37,239
of Manganese and those are pretty good

967
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,239
sources also for labeled

968
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,519
crops uh zinc uh similar to manganese uh

969
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:47,960
we see deficiencies occasionally in

970
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,719
berries in in the Midwest and I think

971
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,440
that occurs also in the

972
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:55,399
Northeast and shortages again are

973
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:59,920
typically occur in soils that are U

974
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,920
Sandy and too alkaline too high n

975
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:07,039
pH treatments here uh again check the pH

976
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,199
reduce it if it's too

977
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:13,119
high uh you can apply folar sprays of

978
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:16,318
zinc sulfate or zinc chelate uh products

979
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,559
if the pH is appropriate and uh there

980
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,960
are some fungicides that contain zinc

981
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:26,160
that can be reasonable sources for uh

982
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,159
labeled uh crops

983
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,679
yeah and question does manganese have

984
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,679
some fungicidal properties itself uh

985
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:43,199
similar to Copper I I don't know that

986
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:46,000
that's the case um good good question I

987
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,000
wish I could answer

988
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:52,199
it uh copper and

989
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,240
malanum uh these uh soils in the Midwest

990
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:56,639
and Northeast uh appear to supply

991
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:59,679
adequate levels of these micronutrients

992
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:03,440
to to berries and uh because

993
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,440
deficiencies haven't really been

994
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:10,000
documented a colleague at uh in Georgia

995
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:12,480
indicates that rabid ey blueberries in

996
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,838
those areas um occasionally are

997
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,599
deficient in

998
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:19,000
Copper uh and he indicates symptoms

999
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:22,280
include abnormally small leaves and and

1000
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,358
short uh or shoot die back during the uh

1001
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,280
during the winter but I don't know that

1002
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:32,078
this this is uh occurred in Northern

1003
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:34,480
High bush in um Midwest to

1004
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,839
Northeast and again there are fixed

1005
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,599
copper fungicides that are suitable

1006
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:44,719
sources copper uh salts can potentially

1007
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:48,920
injure tissues so uh this is something

1008
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:52,318
that that should be uh used with uh with

1009
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:55,159
caution but again copper and Mum U

1010
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:58,159
rarely if ever deficient under our our

1011
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:58,159
conditions

1012
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,599
um and then lastly I wanted to mention

1013
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,919
fertigation U and this is of course the

1014
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,519
injection of fertilizers through trickle

1015
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,318
irrigation systems and the reason this

1016
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:29,480
is um appealing is it's so convenient

1017
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:32,639
and it's a way of increasing the

1018
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,798
efficiency of uh fertilizer

1019
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:38,199
use uh so for berries in the ground uh

1020
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:41,318
fertigation is most useful for

1021
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:43,719
delivering nitrogen and sometimes

1022
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:46,759
pottassium or or phosphorus so the the

1023
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:50,279
big advantages are greater control over

1024
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,359
uh nutrient placement and and timing and

1025
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,720
as a result improved efficiency so less

1026
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:58,798
fertilizer may be required

1027
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,959
but there are some caveats to

1028
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:04,559
that and then disadvantages of course

1029
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,639
are there there's Capital investments in

1030
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,200
uh injector and tanks and backflow

1031
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:12,519
valves and such and then there's some

1032
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:16,000
maintenance and um management uh uh

1033
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:16,000
costs involved in this as

1034
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:22,880
well and many of these typical

1035
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:26,720
fertilizers very soluable so ammonium

1036
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,240
nitrate ammonium sulfate calcium nitrate

1037
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,078
uh very high

1038
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:34,639
solubility uh pottassium uh materials

1039
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:38,000
are um somewhat lower in

1040
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:42,400
solubility um these solubility levels

1041
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:46,199
are pounds of product per per gallon so

1042
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:51,160
they're extremely high uh 16 pounds per

1043
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:54,159
um per gallon is a u extremely high

1044
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:58,598
solubility I wanted to mention that uh

1045
00:55:54,159 --> 00:56:00,879
these levels are all measured the uh 70°

1046
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:03,640
water and solubility of all the

1047
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,119
materials is lower the colder the water

1048
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:09,199
gets so if you're using well water uh

1049
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:13,519
you may find that this is uh um water

1050
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:16,439
will take maybe half as much um of these

1051
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,599
materials as you can get into solution

1052
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:23,358
at

1053
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:27,720
70° as uh one precaution uh is uh don't

1054
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:31,279
mix uh calcium with sulfates or

1055
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:33,399
phosphates so as if you're mixing up

1056
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,720
batch solutions for

1057
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:41,119
fertigation this is a um a general rule

1058
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:43,639
of thumb that uh these will uh cause

1059
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,559
precipitation uh and uh plugging

1060
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:48,960
problems as a result um and you're all

1061
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,839
probably familiar with a jar test so you

1062
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,519
can always take uh proportions of these

1063
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:57,358
materials and mix them up in a jar to

1064
00:56:54,519 --> 00:57:00,199
test for uh mixture and concentrations

1065
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,199
that result in

1066
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:08,719
precipitation the fertigation uh for um

1067
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:11,119
blueberries and brambles some general

1068
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,919
thoughts uh first I think if you're new

1069
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,680
to this you can probably reduce your

1070
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,960
annual rate by about a third uh so

1071
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:21,358
that's assuming there's improved uh

1072
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,960
efficiency and what I would start with

1073
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:28,038
is uh U to split that annual rate into

1074
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,039
multiple applications

1075
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:32,839
uh 2 to 3 weeks uh beginning uh 2 to 3

1076
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,799
weeks after Bud break and continuing

1077
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:38,679
through July for blueberries and into

1078
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:43,519
August for for brambles so that's that's

1079
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:48,199
kind of a a general you can ferate uh uh

1080
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:50,000
weekly or every two weeks or you can uh

1081
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,558
ferate every time you

1082
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,280
irrigate um generally I think the

1083
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,640
efficiency that you gain uh you would

1084
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,920
gain uh

1085
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,798
um that would be gained from a split

1086
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,119
application with three or four um

1087
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:08,038
application dates uh you probably

1088
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,838
wouldn't um improve on that too much by

1089
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:10,839
even continual

1090
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:19,559
fertigation so uh fertigation can be

1091
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,679
very efficient uh assuming that first

1092
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:24,599
year

1093
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:27,519
irrigation um system has high uniformity

1094
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:31,280
so in the Midwest in the Northeast we're

1095
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,798
usually irrigating to supplement uh

1096
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,480
um

1097
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:38,519
um

1098
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:41,318
precipitation um so if your irrigation

1099
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:45,639
system is not particularly uniform it's

1100
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:47,480
not uh such a big deal uh but if you're

1101
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:50,400
supplying all your nutrition through

1102
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,639
that irrigation and the uniform

1103
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,039
uniformity is poor then that becomes a

1104
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,679
bigger

1105
00:58:54,039 --> 00:59:01,079
deal uh nutrients are applied when uh

1106
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:04,118
demand is high so if you're uh fertig

1107
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,440
gating and you're applying um uh

1108
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:10,119
nutrients before Bud break before the

1109
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:13,358
bushes are able to utilize the nutrients

1110
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:16,119
then um You probably won't be achieving

1111
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:18,000
the efficiency that you you could be um

1112
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,280
if you're applying them when the demand

1113
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,280
is

1114
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:27,759
highest and then uh also assuming that

1115
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:32,160
plants are not over irrigated

1116
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:35,880
so if you're uh irrigating uh and

1117
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:38,118
pulsing fertilizer through the system

1118
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,880
and then you're uh irrigating heavily

1119
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:43,280
afterwards it's very easy to push that

1120
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,760
nitrogen down uh through the profile and

1121
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,480
Out Of Reach of the the plants this was

1122
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:52,240
just a a ditch dug across a raspberry

1123
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:56,798
row under a high tunnel so this is the

1124
00:59:52,239 --> 01:00:00,000
trickle irrigation system and just a

1125
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:04,239
illustrate if if you deliver your

1126
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,079
nitrogen where you should deliver it and

1127
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,798
then you over fer over irrigate after

1128
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:12,440
that it's very easy to push it uh down

1129
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,960
below uh the rooting system of the the

1130
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,000
crop so here again you you'd lose the

1131
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,240
efficiency that you might have

1132
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,639
gained and a question about any economic

1133
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:26,558
analyses of uh fertigation that's great

1134
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,920
question I don't know of any

1135
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,480
uh per se

1136
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,798
um

1137
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,480
I yeah I can't really think of any uh

1138
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,159
something that would be useful if it

1139
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,159
were

1140
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:46,598
available so we're just about out of

1141
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:49,440
time and I I wanted to thank uh um

1142
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:51,640
Marvin and Kathy in particular for uh

1143
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,880
organizing this webinar series I think

1144
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:59,239
it's been real real good so are there

1145
01:00:53,880 --> 01:01:01,519
any um closing questions or particularly

1146
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:04,959
comments um anything you'd like to

1147
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,960
discuss further

1148
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,639
question what guidelines for irrigation

1149
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:39,279
uh frequency an inch per week and summer

1150
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:44,038
um for example I think each um I would

1151
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:46,319
go to um uh the strawberry blueberry and

1152
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,880
raspberry uh production guides out of

1153
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:50,920
Cornell I think they uh those

1154
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,838
Publications do a great job of

1155
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,720
summarizing that information in in

1156
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:58,798
detail you know and blueberries and

1157
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:01,358
raspberries in Michigan we always talk

1158
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:05,199
about an inch of water per week through

1159
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:07,038
the uh uh through the season as a a rule

1160
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:10,199
of thumb but I think uh you can

1161
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,720
generally do quite a bit better uh uh

1162
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,558
than that if you have a little bit more

1163
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:15,558
information

1164
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:18,278
available question generally when

1165
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:21,400
blueberries are mulched they say to

1166
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:24,039
increase nitrogen rates a little but

1167
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,599
doesn't that end get released eventually

1168
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:28,839
as the mulch breaks down or does it

1169
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:30,359
disappear that's another great uh

1170
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:33,159
question you know in a perennial

1171
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:37,598
cropping system like that over time you

1172
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:40,278
would uh eventually get to a equili

1173
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,480
equilibrium where your uh the nitrogen

1174
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:47,400
supplied the prior year um will be

1175
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:50,920
partly released and U through microbial

1176
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,680
uh decomposition of the older material

1177
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:57,039
so you're right that if you're applying

1178
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:58,199
a fresh comp uh mulch over underneath

1179
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,559
the uh

1180
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:02,838
blueberries that effect on nitrogen

1181
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:06,319
availability really is during the the

1182
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:10,078
first year after that you may find that

1183
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:12,199
uh you can go back to a a rate that is

1184
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,559
consistent with a site that didn't have

1185
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:18,000
mulch applied to

1186
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,839
it now in reality a lot of Growers would

1187
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:25,000
be uh applying mulch every second third

1188
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:27,519
or fourth year so you have to make those

1189
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,559
uh adjustments over

1190
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:32,880
time the Bob is asking have you seen

1191
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,760
times where applications of

1192
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,960
nitrogen are accident dentally doubled

1193
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,760
or

1194
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:45,559
tripled I I probably have seen those but

1195
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:50,278
I haven't known them at the time

1196
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:53,480
B it with blueberries in particular

1197
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:57,278
what's striking to me is how uh slow

1198
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:00,440
they are to react to um fertility so

1199
01:03:57,278 --> 01:04:03,440
when we've done uh fertilizer trials

1200
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,559
where some of the uh treatments get a

1201
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,480
high rate of nitrogen some of them get

1202
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:11,640
no uh nitrogen it often takes two or

1203
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,199
three or even four years before you see

1204
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,679
a response in the

1205
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:18,639
bushes so uh with these uh pennial

1206
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:19,598
plants like blueberries and probably to

1207
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,159
some

1208
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,119
extent

1209
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:28,719
raspberries they tend to respond slowly

1210
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:28,720
uh to good things and bad things than

1211
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:11,520
um yeah Charlie was asking

1212
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:14,880
cranberries uh

1213
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:18,639
also uh and I assume you're asking about

1214
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,400
uh um response to nitrogen uh

1215
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,519
cranberries are quite a bit more

1216
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,079
responsive to nitrogen than blueberri so

1217
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:28,679
what you do in a particular year uh

1218
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:28,680
you'll see the response to that

1219
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:44,078
year yeah and a question uh um would a

1220
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:46,719
cover crop um be helpful in um tying up

1221
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:49,278
some of the excess nitrogen late in the

1222
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:51,719
season and that that's a great uh point

1223
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:54,960
and it's absolutely true so in Michigan

1224
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,480
a lot of uh a standard uh cover cropping

1225
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,599
system is

1226
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,159
um August or September seated uh annual

1227
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:07,160
Ry and I think part of the benefit of

1228
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:09,719
that rye is it tends to uh soak up some

1229
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:11,920
of the excessive uh fertility in the

1230
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:15,719
soil and perhaps make that available the

1231
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,720
next spring so good good

1232
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:28,480
point I think

1233
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:31,960
Kathy is saying thank you so we're going

1234
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:35,960
to sign off here is that what that means

1235
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,960
Kathy thanks so much for your

1236
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:44,598
attention and uh thank you Eric for uh

1237
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:47,838
joining us today uh we'll be we have

1238
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:50,680
another webinar next week uh and Kathy

1239
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:55,159
will be uh sending out uh information on

1240
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:56,558
that uh during the week so have a good

1241
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:59,318
day

1242
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:03,000
everyone thanks again Eric and Dan talk

1243
01:06:59,318 --> 01:07:03,000
to you all next week
