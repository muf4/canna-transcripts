1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,480
University okay good morning everybody

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,240
and thank you for taking the time to

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
come to to this talk it's my pleasure to

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,879
tell you some of the work we're we have

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,679
been doing for the past probably 10 20

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,278
years already uh in regards of

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,278
understanding what's the function

9
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,879
structure and how uh is the regulation

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,879
of a particular set of membrane

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:34,920
transport proteins that mediate uh uh

12
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:37,280
response response to tolerance of a

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,359
particular set of abiotic stress what

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,120
I'm showing you here is a world map it's

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,840
a heat map of the density of crop areas

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,119
uh nowadays in the

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,879
world it's pretty

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,038
clear come

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,759
on okay when you look at at the at the

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
soils the suitability of soils it's

21
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,358
pretty clear that there's a nice

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,280
correlation where there's a high density

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,640
of Agriculture taking place with the

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,799
quality of the soils around the world

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,599
so it's no big surprise we basically do

26
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,239
agriculture where the soils are good

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,640
however when you take into account that

28
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:15,199
by 2050 our population is increasing by

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,400
about 25% and just in about 20 years or

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,320
so we need to increase uh our production

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,439
by 40% it's obvious that we have to

32
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,599
start thinking about moving into this

33
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,599
marginal soils and start increasing the

34
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,039
productivity that is currently taking

35
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,759
place in this sort of mar marginal soil

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,360
where the soils are not suitable for

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,959
agriculture so these marginal soils are

38
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,039
a result of several abiotic stresses

39
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:44,599
including drought salinity and also

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,439
aluminum toxicity and to tell you why

41
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:51,199
aluminum toxicity such an important

42
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:54,959
abiotic stress I'll first overlap a heat

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,280
map uh describing the P of the soils

44
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,839
around the world acidic phes are shown

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,478
in

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,840
red

47
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,438
so in terms of the total area of the

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,679
world about 30% of the total uh soils in

49
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,439
the world are acidic and that

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,439
constitutes about 70% of the potentially

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,680
be arable lands uh around the world

52
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,519
which includes the South the southern

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,400
tropical band which takes into account

54
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:27,039
uh particular regions where food uh food

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,519
supply and in food stability is more

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,519
tenous at the

57
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,319
moment so so why is aluminum toxicity

58
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
occurring this in this kind of acidic

59
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,359
soils aluminum is pretty harmless at

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,680
neutral and and basic PHS because it's

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,640
bound to to the oxides and the silica

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,239
and the soil however when you start

63
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:49,119
hitting uh low PHS acidic PHS aluminum

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,400
solubilizes into the solution and as the

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,400
pH becomes more acidic what happens is

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
the predominant form that you'll find of

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,640
aluminum in the solution in the

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,599
rizosphere is a3+ and it's this

69
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,598
particular form of aluminum um which is

70
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:08,399
actually phytotoxic to plants so I have

71
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:10,079
that so how toxic is it really let me

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,599
just show you a couple of examples these

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,080
are two maze varieties grown in the

74
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,399
southern part of Brazil in acidic soils

75
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,560
as you can see there's an aluminum

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,039
resistant variety and aluminum sensitive

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,280
the sensitive variety actually has a

78
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,000
significant U loss of yield likewise

79
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,158
this is uh two contrasting varieties

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,799
from wheat the aluminum sensitive

81
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,919
variety which you can see is a really

82
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,120
dramatic inhibition or loss of the root

83
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,280
growth and that's the primary that's the

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,039
primary symptom of aluminum toxicity

85
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,598
aluminum as soon as you expose the roots

86
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,598
to aluminum the root growth

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,560
ceases what that results in is a a loss

88
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,318
of water uptake loss of uh mineral

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,560
uptake and ultimately what what it

90
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,839
translates into is this loss of

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,318
yields so this is just a micrograph

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,640
showing you the degree

93
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,518
of injury that Roots actually experience

94
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,479
upon exposure to aluminum these are the

95
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:11,519
same wheat varieties I'm showing you

96
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:14,518
right here so fortunately there is a a

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,798
generic variation in crop plant species

98
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,358
which we can exploit to understand what

99
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,399
are the physiological mechanisms that

100
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:25,719
underly this this aluminum resistance

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,000
process and for most crops what has been

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,400
founded was early described back in the

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,839
early '90s is that those aluminum

104
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,478
resistant varieties actually upon

105
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,918
exposure to aluminum The Roots Rel

106
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:40,560
release organic acids into the risos

107
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,959
spere what this organic acids do is they

108
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,360
complex the aluminum they keate it and

109
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,079
they form complexes that a are not toxic

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
and B are not taken up by the root that

111
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,120
way they're excluding aluminum from

112
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,799
coming into the root system and uh have

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,879
its uh phytotoxic events so as I said

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,960
this was originally described in wheat

115
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:05,000
subsequently we describe it in MA

116
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,638
but has nowadays been uh reported as a

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,439
very highly conserved mechanism

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,560
throughout a whole variety of crop

119
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:14,319
species so overall aluminum resistance

120
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,079
in plants can be can be achieved by an

121
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,560
exclusion mechanism such as the one I

122
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,120
just described which is the release of

123
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,639
organic acids into the rizosphere

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,199
forming non-toxic complexes or true

125
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,280
tolerance or detoxification mechanisms

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,759
if aluminum is able to get across the

127
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,638
across the plasma membr of the root

128
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,479
cells it can form complexes uh with

129
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,478
Organic acids which are sequestered into

130
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,000
the vacle of the roots and stored there

131
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,519
in a nontoxic form or in some cases it

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,759
it can actually be loaded into Asylum

133
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,758
translocated into the into the shoots

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
where it sequestered it and this is the

135
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,560
case of uh plants which are aluminum

136
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,280
hyper accumulators such as the case of

137
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,600
um of tea crops so for the purpose of

138
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,279
this talk all I'm focusing

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,479
on is what I'm going to talk about is uh

140
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,758
a aluminum exclusion mechanisms and

141
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:04,758
particularly I'm going to talk about

142
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,680
these two Transporters or the nature of

143
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,360
these Transporters

144
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
here so the mayor breakthrough in terms

145
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,319
of uh understanding what was the

146
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,918
molecular identity of the Transporters

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,840
mediating this release or of organic

148
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:23,758
acids came back in 2004 about 10 years

149
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:26,038
ago by by Sasaki at all in Japan and uh

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
they basically cloned a novel

151
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,199
transporter which they called aluminum

152
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,598
activated melee transporter or almt in

153
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
wheat in

154
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:39,279
2004 in 2007 Leon's group actually

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,680
cloned the second aluminum tus Gene and

156
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,758
what they found out is there is an

157
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,918
additional transporter or an additional

158
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,120
family of Transporters they clone it for

159
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,439
sorum and it's a family of Transporters

160
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,319
from the multi-drug toxic compound

161
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:55,038
extion family or

162
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,720
mates these two Transporters are very

163
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,120
different in terms of uh their secondary

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,479
structure their structure and the way

165
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,120
they function these are predominantly ni

166
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,959
and channel type of Transporters while

167
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,959
these are sort of

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,959
antiporters so in terms of uh signal

169
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,680
transduction it's a very complex uh

170
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,560
network of signal transduction Cascades

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,759
which basically the aluminum um stress

172
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,800
is sense and there's a whole uh bunch of

173
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,680
transcriptional Regulation going on

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,240
which ultimately affects the expression

175
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,720
of these two two transporters the lmts

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,918
in the mates however what I'm interested

177
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,240
in talking about today is how are these

178
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,799
Transporters actually post translated

179
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,680
regulated in other words I'm not

180
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,120
interested in in finding out what's

181
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,439
what's the gene uh at the Le at the gene

182
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,399
level what is the transcriptional

183
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,639
regulation of these Transporters but the

184
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,959
protein itself how does it work how does

185
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,158
it mediate the release of organic acid

186
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,439
and can the protein actually respond by

187
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,959
itself to the presence of extracellular

188
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,560
aluminum so I'm going to focus today on

189
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,839
the lmts and I'll leave the the the mate

190
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,720
story for another opportunity so the we

191
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:11,598
almt was cloned back in 2004 and it said

192
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,240
the it was the the first almt

193
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,000
characterized at that time and thus they

194
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,840
gave it the name of aluminum activated

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,598
melee release Channel since then we know

196
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,758
that they're expressing the root tips

197
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,279
and subsequently we and other groups

198
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,038
were involved in the cloning of amalog

199
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:30,038
uh amalog genes to lmt1 which these

200
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,759
genes are in fact involveed aluminum

201
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,718
resistance they mediate the release of

202
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
organic acids and they're associated

203
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,080
with the aluminum resistance response

204
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,158
however nowadays we know that the LMT

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,080
family is not just uh Anon channels

206
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,720
involved in aluminum resistance but

207
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,278
they're involved in other physiological

208
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
processes there are lmts that are

209
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,120
expressed in guard cells so they're

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,120
involved in in the regulation of guard

211
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,399
cells there are other lmts that are that

212
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,639
are expressed in Roots and they are

213
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,200
involved in the in Mineral nutrition and

214
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,199
general

215
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
uptake

216
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
from a philogenetic point of view from

217
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,679
The genome sequence projects we're able

218
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,278
to establish that the LMT family is

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,838
pretty much divided into five different

220
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,519
clades with the set of uh aluminum

221
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,120
resistance related almts belonging to

222
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,200
Clay one now this is the only set of

223
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,399
almts thus far that has been

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,120
functionally characterized this is just

225
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,240
based in a genome sequencing

226
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,120
projects from a secondary structure

227
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,759
point of

228
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,720
view most event have a conserved

229
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,480
structure which consists of the first

230
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,879
half of the protein contains about six

231
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,320
transmembrane domains with the other

232
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,759
half of the protein being more uh

233
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,278
hydrophilic and containing

234
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:52,120
a it's it's about half of the protein

235
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:54,639
which is a a highly hydrophilic region

236
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,720
which I'll talk later about so giving

237
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,278
the similarity in the structure of all

238
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,879
these almts what we're interested in

239
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:05,159
finding out is what makes a given LMT

240
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:08,600
like this a LMT that is related to the

241
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,639
aluminum resistant phenotypes that we

242
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,040
observed we know that there are some

243
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,679
almts that are actually expressed in

244
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,319
Roots but they're not related to the

245
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,120
aluminum resistance so there must be

246
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,000
something about this particular set of

247
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,799
almts that allow them to confer aluminum

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,200
resistance phenotype in

249
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,879
plants so for this purpose what we've

250
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,640
been doing is we've been doing

251
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,879
structural and functional anal Anis of

252
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:37,838
particular of the the weat almt1 what we

253
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:40,759
do is we use a functional uh we use at

254
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,880
expression in alloc sites what we can do

255
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,679
is we can generate we we can express the

256
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,360
the transporter we can generate using

257
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,199
conventional molecular biology tools we

258
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,079
can generate different chimeras or

259
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,240
single point mutations

260
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:57,399
trations and so on just Express them in

261
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,959
the oyes we can generate CRNA we inject

262
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,839
the CRNA into the IDE cell which is

263
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:05,759
about 1 mm in diameter so it's really

264
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,120
convenient in terms of doing micro

265
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,919
injections this cells Express the the

266
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,000
CRNA they translate it they place your

267
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,000
transporter in the cell and you can

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,559
perform either functional studies using

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
conventional electrophysiological

270
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,278
techniques such as two Electro voltage

271
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,320
clamp or you can do structur uh

272
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:26,679
structural studies using uh taking

273
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,720
advantage advantage of different

274
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,519
fluorochromes what this allow us to do

275
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
is

276
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,399
perform the functional and structural

277
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,920
studies set hypothesis in terms of we

278
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,240
are expecting in terms of the relation

279
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,000
of the structure to the function of

280
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,720
these

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,919
Transporters and test test our our

282
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
hypothesis by generating different

283
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,039
versions or structurally modifying the

284
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,159
LMT and seeing what its impact in the

285
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:55,519
functionality of that transport protein

286
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,719
is so first giving the let me just take

287
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,159
you back one

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,720
slide given the fact that this uh

289
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,759
almt mediates the release of organic

290
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,680
acids upon exposure to aluminum what

291
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,759
we're interested to see first was what's

292
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,479
the interaction of aluminum with the

293
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,198
actual transporter and for that reason

294
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,320
the first step we have to take is to

295
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,639
determine what is the topology of the

296
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,879
LMT across the plasma membrane is this

297
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,560
side facing the cytool side or is it

298
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:26,120
facing the apoplasmic side of of the

299
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,518
membrane in terms of which is the part

300
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,278
of the protein that first sees the

301
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,639
aluminum experiences the presence of of

302
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,240
the L3

303
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:38,079
plus so to carry on the the membrane

304
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,079
topology studies of LMT what we have

305
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,919
developed is a technique where we have

306
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,799
taken advantage of the pH sensitivity of

307
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,639
the

308
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,198
gfp in such a way that the intensity of

309
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,278
the fluoresence of the emission of the

310
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:52,838
gfp is pH dependent such that when you

311
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,198
start hitting acidic

312
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,320
PHS the emission of the gfp or the

313
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,879
intensity squatched down it's

314
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,240
reduced so what we first developed was a

315
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,759
method where we can monitor the

316
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,879
intracellular pH of the oosy using a

317
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,799
small uh pH micro electrode so we impale

318
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,600
those cells with the pH micro electrode

319
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,479
and we establish a set of extracellular

320
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,480
solutions which we profuse on on the

321
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,720
outside of the oide and measure the

322
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,800
changes in PH that occur internally in

323
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
the

324
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,240
oide and this is what we observe as we

325
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,359
change the extracellular pH from 7.5

326
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,600
through 7 .5 plus sodium acetate or

327
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,879
extracellular pH of5 we maintain a

328
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,920
relatively constant intracellular pH

329
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,078
however when we put sodium um

330
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,399
extracellular solution of ph5 plus

331
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:47,479
sodium acetate sodium acetate is a weak

332
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,399
acid which dissociates at ph5 permal

333
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,600
bias is the membrane of the oide gets

334
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:55,039
inside and yields this intracellular

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,000
acidification in the oide so having

336
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,719
established this methodology we look at

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,278
what's what's the change in the Rel

338
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,360
ative fluoresence of the gfp through

339
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:07,240
this this uh set of solutions and what

340
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm showing you here is a confocal image

341
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,839
of

342
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,799
uh of the edge of the oide as it's being

343
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,160
bathed through this different set of

344
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,919
solutions so at 7.5 is it running yep

345
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,719
basically the the intensity of the gfp

346
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,479
doesn't change and as soon as we put in

347
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,879
5.0 plus sodium acetate what we obtain

348
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,800
is a quenching of the gfb so we have a

349
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,879
nice system where we can correlate

350
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:35,159
changes in in the intensity of the gfp

351
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,240
with changes in intracellular pH so that

352
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,559
we we can use that as an indicator of

353
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,278
potentially where where is the gfp found

354
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,838
in this case obviously the soluble gfp

355
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:47,320
is found in the inell space we did the

356
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,320
same with a particular transporter at

357
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,079
mate by tagging it in the end Terminus

358
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,639
with the gfp and what we obtain is a

359
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,439
similar pattern to that described for

360
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,799
the soluble gfp we know that that that

361
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,240
the the inter terminal domain of the at

362
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,879
mate is located in the inside so we have

363
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,519
a good indication that our technique is

364
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,278
working now we use a negative control

365
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,480
using opt3 a transporter that uh we

366
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,278
heard about early this year a talk given

367
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,959
by Alena and uh we tagged it at the C

368
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,799
terminal we know that the thank you we

369
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,919
know that the ca terminal of of that

370
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,679
transporter is located to the

371
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,838
outside and just as you would expect

372
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,359
when you bath it to the different set of

373
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,199
conditions we have there's no change in

374
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,560
the first two solutions but as soon as

375
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:37,198
there's ph5 in the extrasellar space we

376
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,559
quench the gfb so we have a nice system

377
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,599
to show to basically use the gfpf an

378
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,638
indicator of is that particular n

379
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,839
Terminus or C Terminus located to the

380
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,399
inell space or the apoplasmic face of

381
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,399
the

382
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,719
transporter using this approach we took

383
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,359
our Gene of Interest the weed lmt1 we

384
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,120
first tag it in the C in the end

385
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,278
Terminus and what what we obtain is

386
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,198
pretty much the similar Behavior to what

387
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:08,000
we obtain for the soluble gfp indicating

388
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,639
that this particular gfb here is is

389
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,958
facing or it's located in the inter

390
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,560
space of the cell we've taken the same

391
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:17,119
approach with Transporters tagged at the

392
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,000
C Terminus we know that this C Terminus

393
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
is actually located into the inside of

394
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,759
the cell we know that the end of the

395
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,639
transmembrane domain six is also located

396
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,120
to to the inside of the cell and there

397
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,079
was some controversy about the potential

398
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,000
existence of additional transmembrane

399
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,719
domains around this region what we've

400
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,799
done is we've taken the gfp and we've

401
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,000
flanked those different transmembrane

402
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:41,958
domains and we found that uh the gfp is

403
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,039
located towards the inside indicating

404
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,278
that there's no transmembrane domain

405
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,000
region there even though it might be a a

406
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,318
highly hydrophobic region it might be

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,278
involved in the anchoring of the protein

408
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:56,639
rather than actually constituting a

409
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,639
domain which transverses the the lipid

410
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
bilayer

411
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,600
so having established the topology of

412
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,078
the protein the next thing we're

413
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,678
interested in understanding is how does

414
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,959
the protein assemble does the the

415
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,120
channel work as a single subunit so one

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,919
single subunit of almt is functionally

417
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,399
active or does it assemble as a

418
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,120
multimeric uh transporter in such a way

419
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,559
that you require the Assembly of several

420
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,399
subunits to form the actual functional

421
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,839
channel for this purpose we have used

422
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,640
BFC pretty much a well established

423
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,279
technique by now we've tagged the

424
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,919
subunits of almt with the two

425
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:39,000
complimentary halves of the yfp and what

426
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,559
we we get is complation of the yfp at

427
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,079
the plasma membrane indicating that almt

428
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,440
the almt subunits are actually

429
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,918
interacting we've also tagged the the

430
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,279
subunits in in opposite directions with

431
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,679
half of the of the yfp attached to the

432
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,000
end the other half attached to to the C

433
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,280
Terminus and we also obtain

434
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,759
complementation suggesting once again

435
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,440
that the C Terminus in and the end

436
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,879
Terminus are facing in the same in in

437
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,880
the same compartment the cytoplasma of

438
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,960
of the

439
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,320
cell so we know that the LMT subunits

440
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,360
interact the next thing we we were

441
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,599
wondering is what's the stomry of LMT so

442
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,399
are two subunits interacting or is the

443
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,599
transporter consisting of three or four

444
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,480
subunits

445
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,439
interacting for this purpose we're

446
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,679
collaborating with uh the is of lab in

447
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,840
UC Berkeley and uh what they use is they

448
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,960
use uh Turf microscopy

449
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:35,399
to to address this particular question

450
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,679
so the first step we had to do was prove

451
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,798
that their technique actually is

452
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,038
suitable for starting uh plant membrane

453
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:44,798
Transporters not just just suitable for

454
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:47,679
starting animal channel Transporters so

455
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,798
what we did is we tagged uh cat one with

456
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,400
a gfp cat one is a potassium channel

457
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,240
from arabidopsis and there's there's

458
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,120
good knowledge about the structure and

459
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,359
the Assembly of of this type of

460
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,678
potassium channels what we've shown is

461
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,439
that the functional properties of the

462
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,120
intacted cat one resemble those of the

463
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,880
cat taged with the gfp so the addition

464
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,239
of the gfp is not affecting the

465
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,200
functionality of the

466
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,000
transporter when we express that

467
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,360
transporter in all sites and in a low

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,880
density under the turf microscope what

469
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,798
you can observe is actually single gfp

470
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,000
molecules that are being photo

471
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:31,079
bleached single uh single gfp molecule

472
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,960
when you look in in detail to to a

473
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,319
particular set of of those single spots

474
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,798
and I'm just going to show you I want to

475
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,158
focus on on this red region

476
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,400
here what we can do is we can actually

477
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,960
measure the changes in intensity that

478
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,240
take place in that particular spot as

479
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,600
the as the gfp is being quenched by by

480
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,440
the laser so basically what we get is a

481
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,719
high-intensity point and as the gfp is

482
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,400
being bleached you lose the signal and

483
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,079
that's what's being Quantified here over

484
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,960
a period of about 20 seconds now what

485
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:06,079
you see is that the change in intensity

486
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,480
actually occurs in four very discrete

487
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:12,158
steps it's not a continuous Behavior but

488
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,720
you have four different steps or

489
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,799
discrete changes what that is telling

490
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,798
you is that you actually have four gfp

491
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,720
molecules that are emitting in that

492
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,679
particular spot four gfp molecules each

493
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,798
one attached to one of the subunits of

494
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,559
cat one in other words but that telling

495
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,200
is in every single spot that you look at

496
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:36,960
what you're finding is cat one assembled

497
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,240
as a tetr consisting of of the four

498
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,519
subunits and this is what actually forms

499
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,359
the functional transporter of cat one

500
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,679
four subunits assemble in such a way

501
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,719
that this this region in the middle

502
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,159
actually consists of the permeation

503
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,919
pathway or the pore of the transporter

504
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,799
so knowing that we can actually use this

505
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,919
technique for for plant cells what we

506
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,639
did is we implemented it for the almt1

507
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,840
and other almts and what we obtain is

508
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,159
that the Transporters actually assemble

509
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,158
as a

510
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,240
dier so this is the functional state of

511
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,798
the transporter we've done this for not

512
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,798
only the weat LMT we know that it's um

513
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,918
that also happens for the arabidopsis

514
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:25,079
for the maze LMT so apparently the dim

515
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,038
state is conserved throughout the entire

516
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:30,439
alent

517
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:33,359
family so what I've shown you so far is

518
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,400
those structural studies that we've done

519
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,119
uh basically just coming out from a

520
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,960
secondary structure we're able to know

521
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,918
more or less the topology of the LMT

522
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,360
across the membrane which part faces the

523
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,480
cytoplasm which part face the

524
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,319
extrasellar side we know that assembles

525
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,319
as a dimer now what we're interested in

526
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,480
in finding out are uh what are what are

527
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,678
the functional properties of this almt

528
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,798
and how do those functional properties

529
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,960
correlate with the structure

530
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,400
or the secondary structure

531
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,798
prediction so for that purpose once

532
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,000
again what we're doing is we're

533
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,879
expressing our protein of interest in

534
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,319
the oocytes we're able to load the

535
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,159
oocytes with the substrate in this case

536
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,439
melate we micro inject the cells with

537
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,520
melate a couple of hours prior to doing

538
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,840
the electrophysiological recordings and

539
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,798
we used two Electro voltage clamp to

540
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,119
study the activity of that transporter

541
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:28,519
expressed across the plasma

542
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,719
membrane to to put in simple terms

543
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,079
what we do is the cell is so big it's 1

544
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,880
mm in diameter we're able to impale two

545
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,119
micro electrodes on it with one micro

546
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,320
electrode we are able to impose a

547
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,918
voltage across the plasma membrane of

548
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,038
the cell with the other microelectrode

549
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,679
what we're able to do is we're able to

550
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,278
record the currents that are elicited or

551
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,559
that happen at that particular holding

552
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,159
potential those currents are simply the

553
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,359
movement of of ions across the plasma

554
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,120
membrane current is just the transport

555
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,119
the transport of ions across the plasma

556
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,119
membrane

557
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,200
so let me show you what happens in a

558
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,919
control cells by control cells I mean

559
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,038
cells that have not been injected with

560
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,120
the RNA so they're not expressing the

561
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:17,759
transporter versus what happens with

562
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,199
cells that have been injected with the

563
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,240
almt

564
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,759
transporter so here I'm showing you a

565
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,679
holding potential ofus 100 molts this is

566
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,200
the magnitude of the current again it's

567
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:32,400
simply a a it just relates to the amount

568
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,038
of Transport that's taking place control

569
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,360
cells so show a very small current very

570
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:41,200
basil endogenous transport taking place

571
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,798
across the plasma membrane and lmts in

572
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,120
the absence of aluminum mediate a

573
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,400
slightly larger transport in those cells

574
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,959
however what's really important is that

575
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,679
upon just adding aluminum to the bath so

576
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,600
basically you replace the bath medium

577
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,600
for the same solution but now it

578
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:01,240
includes uh about 20 micromolar aluminum

579
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,439
chloride what you get is a very

580
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,120
relatively quick it happens within a

581
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,600
couple of minutes a very quick

582
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:13,479
enhancement of the transport activity

583
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,959
mediated by aluminum by by LMT sorry so

584
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,319
here basically we have a transporter

585
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,360
that is not at the regulatory it's not

586
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,000
at the transcription level but actually

587
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,278
just happens within minute so basically

588
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,119
the transporter somehow is sensing the

589
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,919
presence of aluminum the fact that

590
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,439
aluminum interacts with the transporter

591
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,679
changes it Con changes the

592
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,640
confirmational state and it surrenders

593
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,640
the transporter in a more active

594
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
state so this is another way of of uh

595
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,679
looking at the transport activity of

596
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,319
almts so rather than holding holding the

597
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,080
the membrane potential for a long period

598
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:52,359
of time what we can do is we can just uh

599
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,199
look at the transport activity over a

600
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:56,319
small period of time of about 600

601
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,640
milliseconds at a given voltage say

602
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,960
minus 100 m 100 - 140 M

603
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,120
volts we measure the magnitude of the

604
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,759
transport at that particular uh voltage

605
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,158
and then we just keep changing the

606
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,119
holding potential to smaller and smaller

607
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,278
less negative holding potentials and we

608
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,319
keep measuring the transport activity at

609
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,759
those particular voltages so once again

610
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,398
these are just traces superimposed or

611
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,398
current magnitude superimposed at

612
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,639
different holding potentials once again

613
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:27,000
control cells show a very small

614
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,080
transport activity they still have some

615
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,558
transport activity and it's obvious it's

616
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:32,960
it's the transport activity from the

617
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,319
endogenous Transporters of the cell but

618
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,319
when you express almt you you obtain

619
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:42,000
a you obtain a magnitude of Transport

620
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:44,158
much higher which is mediated by this

621
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,519
transporter but most importantly when

622
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,399
you expose them to Al to to aluminum to

623
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,398
extracellular aluminum what you obtain

624
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,879
is once again an enhancement of the

625
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:56,000
transport activity mediated by the almt1

626
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,240
channel I'm not going to go into the

627
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,480
bioh physics of it but B basically we

628
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,120
can perform our s of analysis based on

629
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
the magnitudes of this current and the

630
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,678
different voltages and substrates that

631
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,319
we used which what I what I want to

632
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,399
summarize is that we do know that the

633
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:14,439
lmt1 one as I showed you is enhanced by

634
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,599
the presence of extracellular luminum

635
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,159
second it mediates negative currents

636
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,278
which are actually the product of melee

637
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,120
moving from the inside of the cell into

638
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,119
the outside of the

639
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:31,159
cell so here we are we have a transport

640
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,679
water that mediates organic acid release

641
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,399
just like you would expect it in in

642
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,960
Roots and most importantly it responds

643
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:40,479
to the presence of

644
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,640
aluminum so we're interested in finding

645
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,319
out what is it that

646
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,559
determines that aluminum enhancement

647
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,398
property and this is all I'm going to

648
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,158
talk about for the rest of the talk and

649
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,398
it's what are the motives or what are

650
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,278
the parts of the protein that are

651
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,759
actually responsible for

652
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:59,359
sensing the aluminum the extraer phase

653
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,679
so what we have been doing is we have no

654
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,319
structural knowledge of the LMT apart

655
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,600
from secondary structureal predictions

656
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,119
so we've

657
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,119
taken uh originally we took a crude

658
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,599
approach which is we started looking at

659
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,719
truncations of the protein so we started

660
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:18,558
by removing the terminal 19 amino

661
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,319
acids and we express that truncated

662
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,599
version of the protein into all sides

663
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,398
and we compare the transport properties

664
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:28,278
relative to the unmodified protein so

665
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:31,079
when you truncate the last 19 amino

666
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:33,440
acids basically you get a transporter

667
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:36,119
where the transport properties are not

668
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,798
affected the same is true if we removed

669
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:42,000
up to residue 435 so basically

670
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,918
expression of the first 435 residues

671
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,480
including this transmembrane domains

672
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,600
plus part of the SE tail results in a

673
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,519
transporter that's functionally

674
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:55,000
active however when we remove uh five

675
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,720
amino acid acids more from the terminal

676
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,880
region what we obtain is a transport

677
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,798
that is no longer functional we've lost

678
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,919
the activity of the transporter both the

679
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,960
basal activity of the transporter and

680
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,919
obviously as well as the enhan ability

681
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,038
of the the enhan ability feature of the

682
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,120
transporter we know that the transporter

683
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,158
is being targeted to the plasma membrane

684
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,879
so there's something about the folding

685
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,640
that has been lost that surrenders the

686
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,720
transporter uh nonfunctional not

687
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,399
surprisingly when you keep doing more

688
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,640
truncations around the ca terminal

689
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:28,798
domain we obtain Transporters that are

690
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,080
basically nonfunctional what was

691
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,879
surprising was upon removal of the

692
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,720
entire C terminal domain that long

693
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,240
hydrophilic tail what we obtain is a

694
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,679
transporter that recovers its

695
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,720
functionality however just just the the

696
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,200
end terminous domain being expressed

697
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,038
being functional it cannot be enhanced

698
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,919
or it's not responsive to the presence

699
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:56,440
of extracellular aluminum so what that

700
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,440
posed um what that what that is telling

701
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,600
us is the interal domain this first half

702
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,360
of the protein underlies the permeation

703
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,678
pathway which is not surprising seeing

704
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,158
that it contains the transmembrane

705
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,919
domains forming the pore where the ions

706
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,200
are going to flow through across the

707
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,200
Bayer but the question is is this C

708
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,519
terminal

709
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,720
domain we know that it's not essential

710
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,000
for protein functioning but is it

711
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,399
actually a domain that determines the

712
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,398
aluminum enhan ability of the

713
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,398
protein

714
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,720
so

715
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,839
when we expressed LMT we're able to

716
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,038
calculate a km for the aluminum enhan

717
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,439
ability of the transporter basically

718
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:41,398
it's concentration dependent and around

719
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,600
five micromolar we're able to get 50%

720
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,918
maximum activation or enhancement of the

721
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:49,398
transport activity of the almt what that

722
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,679
is telling us is that that high Affinity

723
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:54,278
what it suggests is basically aluminum

724
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,880
being al3 plus most likely is binding to

725
00:29:54,278 --> 00:30:02,159
negatively charged residues in the

726
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:04,159
protein thus stand sorry g g uh we're

727
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
measuring the the conductance so

728
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,480
basically we look at the relationship

729
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,759
between voltage and current and the

730
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,599
slope of of of that relationship should

731
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,480
tell you what the conductance or the

732
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,240
transport rate of the transporter would

733
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,759
be so it's the basically the conductance

734
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,640
we obtain at a given U aluminum activity

735
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,839
over the the maximum conductance we're

736
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,360
able to

737
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:31,119
obtain so what that what that suggests

738
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,839
is that al3+ is most likely binding to

739
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,439
negative residues in the in the

740
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,038
transporter so to evaluate the role of

741
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,360
the C terminal of the LMT what we did is

742
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,398
we started neutralizing every single

743
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,879
amino acid negative residue uh in in the

744
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,759
C terminal of the LMT by changing

745
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,000
aspartic acid either to asparagine or

746
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:52,759
glutamic acid changing into glutamine so

747
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,398
basically we're neutralizing each one of

748
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,599
those residues we take each one of those

749
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:00,158
single point mutations we Express them

750
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,638
in all sides and again we compare the

751
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,600
influence or the potential change in the

752
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,519
functionality of the transporter

753
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:10,719
relative to the non-modified

754
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,960
transporter the data I'll be showing you

755
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,319
just um is just in regards to the

756
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,759
responsive of the transporter whoopa how

757
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,759
did that

758
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,119
happen

759
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,440
wow where are

760
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,798
we talk about

761
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,759
freak where somewhere around there

762
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,360
right

763
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,359
okay Jesus stay away from

764
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,879
it there we go so all the the all I'm

765
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,399
going to be talking about is the changes

766
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,600
in aluminum responsiveness how much does

767
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:02,479
the uh responsiveness of each one of

768
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,480
these Transporters changes relative to a

769
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,240
while type which we're going we're

770
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,480
calling 100% responsiveness so what you

771
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,759
can see is we we obtain a whole uh

772
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,200
variety of phenotypes in terms of the

773
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,319
percentage of enhancement which goes

774
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,159
from uh transports that are a little bit

775
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:22,759
more responsive but overall most of the

776
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,960
uh single uh mutations or most of the

777
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,200
neutralizations result in Transporters

778
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,038
with lower responsiveness with a couple

779
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,200
or a few Transporters that have actually

780
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,558
lost the responsiveness to aluminum

781
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,360
another way of presenting that

782
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,000
data is is this way in terms of the

783
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,798
magnitude of the responsiveness but this

784
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,038
is just to highlight that it's not a

785
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,798
discrete response but it's rather a very

786
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:47,720
continuous

787
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:51,720
response so there are interesting

788
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,519
residues like 274 275 and 423 where we

789
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,880
have actually lost the responsiveness of

790
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,558
the transporter and it's very tempting

791
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,039
and actually uh

792
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,158
the Japanese group proposed it initially

793
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:05,200
to say well we have identified the

794
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,519
residues where aluminum is binding to

795
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,960
the LMT as soon as we neutralize them

796
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,038
aluminum can no longer bind to the LMT

797
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,798
thus it's no longer responsive to

798
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:19,000
aluminum however we know that that's not

799
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:21,240
the case when when you look at the

800
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,599
distribution of those particular

801
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,919
residues uh throughout the entire 400 or

802
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:30,599
so sequences so far known for the alumin

803
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,720
for the lmts what we see is that

804
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:36,759
residues like 274

805
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,639
275 or residues like 423 are actually

806
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:40,839
highly conserved or entirely conserved

807
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:43,879
throughout the entire LMT

808
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:46,038
family so most of this sequence includes

809
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,320
lmts which are not related to the

810
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:51,679
aluminum uh resistance response so what

811
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,720
we think it's happening is among these

812
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,200
residues we have identified residues or

813
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,319
we have mutated residues which are high

814
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,120
conserved and they are required is

815
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:04,638
actually for uh they're required for

816
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,439
protein stability and proper functioning

817
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:10,159
as a overall almt family and they

818
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,320
actually have nothing to do with the

819
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,919
aluminum binding to a transporter or

820
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,200
with the phenotype of aluminum

821
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:18,199
responsiveness to

822
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:24,519
prove to prove this uh this hypothesis

823
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,398
what we did is we look for highly

824
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:29,119
conserved residues throughout the entire

825
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,199
family residues which are not uh

826
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,039
negatively charged s such as the

827
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,638
tryptophan here tryptophan

828
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:39,079
283 and what we' done is we've done a a

829
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,519
single point substitution in that

830
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,399
residue as well as a residue 218 or 431

831
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:49,119
but basically what we show is if you're

832
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:51,319
able to uh substitute those highly

833
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,440
conserved residues what you end up with

834
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,879
is a series of Transporters that are no

835
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,960
longer as functional as the original

836
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:01,199
almt therefore we do believe that these

837
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,480
residues negative residues we identified

838
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,639
originally are more involved in overall

839
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,920
protein stability folding and

840
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,358
functionality rather than they having

841
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,960
something to do with the aluminum

842
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,119
responsive responsiveness

843
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,599
phenotype so the next question we wanted

844
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,960
to address was can we move then the

845
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:22,240
entire C terminal

846
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,800
block uh and the entire C terminal block

847
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:28,239
is the one responsible for the aluminum

848
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,240
responsiveness so we have characterized

849
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,479
several almts this is the one I've been

850
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,559
talking about it's aluminum enhanceable

851
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,679
we know that the Hue in arabidopsis is

852
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,559
also aluminum enhanceable in the Maze uh

853
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,719
almt1 is not aluminum enhanceable so

854
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,480
what we' done done is we've done the

855
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,480
we've swapped the domains basically we

856
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,719
take the end terance of this transporter

857
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,119
and we attach the end terminers of this

858
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,559
transporter or we can take the inter

859
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,318
terance of this transporter and attach

860
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,559
the C termin of this transporter

861
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,279
resulting in this swap domain

862
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,559
in that way we've generated six

863
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,800
different uh swap domains we express the

864
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,400
cells uh we express these contracts in

865
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,920
all sides and we look at the changes in

866
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,000
functionality so just to summarize all

867
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,720
that data in a very colorful way here

868
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,358
I'm showing you once again the lmts

869
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,719
which are responsive and the lmts which

870
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:20,078
is not

871
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:22,679
responsive when you take the C terminal

872
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,880
region of the responsive almts and you

873
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,399
attach attach them to the interus of a

874
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,720
non-responsive

875
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,838
what do you obtain is no aluminum

876
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,358
enhancement activity so just the sea

877
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,838
block moved to a pore of a different

878
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:40,039
transporter is not able to uh enhance

879
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:43,239
the transport activity of that

880
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:45,559
almt likewise if you take the C Terminus

881
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,838
from from the non-responsive one and you

882
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:50,358
place it into the end terminous Poe

883
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,358
region of the two of the wheat and the

884
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,559
arabis what you obtain is actually an

885
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:56,920
enhancement of the transport activity

886
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,759
which was quite POS uh puzzling as we

887
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,800
thought that the ous domain was not

888
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,000
involved finally when when you swept

889
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,039
them among the two responsive responsive

890
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,679
ones what you get is in some instances

891
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,000
it's able to recover it and the other

892
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,480
construct is not able to recover it what

893
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,239
that is telling us that the nature of

894
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,280
the end terminal domain which what we

895
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,639
had this card originally is actually a

896
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,640
determinant of aluminum enhan

897
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,639
ability

898
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,640
so we decided to look at the end term

899
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,199
domain in terms of the potential

900
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,400
negative residues associated with the

901
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,239
with that protein region and once again

902
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,480
we perform single point mutations and we

903
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:38,639
look at changes in phenotype once again

904
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,679
we obtain a very continuous uh changes

905
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,639
in phenotype relative to the aluminum

906
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,598
responsiveness we obtain several

907
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,838
residues which basically surrended the

908
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,318
surrender the transporter in a state

909
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:50,318
where it's no longer enhanced by

910
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,679
aluminum I forgot mentioning that all

911
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,440
the single por mutations that we've done

912
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:56,838
actually result in Transporters which

913
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,200
are functionally active they mediate the

914
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:01,639
basal level what varies is their degree

915
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,159
of aluminum responsiveness however once

916
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:06,480
again when you look at this at the at

917
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,799
the residues at this particular residues

918
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,599
what we find is they are highly

919
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,480
conserved throughout the entire LMT

920
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,400
family so suggesting once again we

921
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,880
cannot attribute a role to these

922
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,838
residues to the aluminum responsiveness

923
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,000
of the protein but rather we think

924
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:25,519
they're involved in overall functioning

925
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and uh stability of the LMT

926
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,920
family so the question is

927
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,159
uh is it all lost was it a lot of uh

928
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,720
single point mutation analysis that led

929
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,358
us know where um we took a different

930
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,719
approach so far what I showed you is how

931
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,440
we try to correlate the changes in in a

932
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,439
particular residue with the distribution

933
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,280
throughout the entire family based on uh

934
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,720
sequences from genomic uh

935
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,680
efforts now what we tried to look the

936
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:55,318
question we posed was okay let's let's

937
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,318
take a look at what What's Happening

938
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:00,759
Here in terms of the functionality but

939
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:03,239
are we able to find any domain on the

940
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,359
set of almts that have been functionally

941
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:08,078
characterized we have three lmts that we

942
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:09,920
know are responsive to aluminum and we

943
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,519
have a set of lmts that are not

944
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,680
responsive to aluminum can we find in

945
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:17,480
sequence alignments any particular

946
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:20,358
domain that might be unique to this set

947
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,000
of almes and the answer is yes what we

948
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:25,119
ended up finding is a motif right at the

949
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,440
beginning of the protein right at the

950
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,160
extreme uh end of the end term we found

951
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,200
a motif that is associated and is found

952
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,159
uniquely in this set of almts which are

953
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,279
uh aluminum

954
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,440
responsive so this is how the motif

955
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,640
looks is basically a highly conserved

956
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,599
region of the first 12 amino acids with

957
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:48,118
a variable region between two and up to

958
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,800
35

959
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:53,240
residues most interesting when when you

960
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,760
now now we're walking back to the

961
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,838
philogenetic analysis and we say okay

962
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,680
let's look through through all the

963
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,838
philogenetic uh through the 400

964
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:04,078
sequences that have been available at

965
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:06,599
the moment and see how this uh

966
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,400
identified Mo Motif is present in this

967
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,519
clades what we find is that out of the

968
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,519
403 sequences we find 17 sequences that

969
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,759
contain this Motif and interestingly

970
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,920
that Motif is only contained in

971
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,920
sequences that belong to Clay one which

972
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
is the the clay which accounts for this

973
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,119
particular

974
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,559
Transporters so everything seems to

975
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,920
indicate that this motif might be

976
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,039
associated with the uh aluminum

977
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,880
responsiveness of LMT and this is

978
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:39,639
current work that we're performing in

979
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,920
the lab what we've done is uh we have

980
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:46,159
removed that in uh that 35 amino acid

981
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,240
Motif and we know that the LMT upon

982
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,799
removing this Motif is no longer

983
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,399
functional so it's no well it's

984
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,160
functional but it's no longer responsive

985
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,079
to

986
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,679
aluminum however if we remove the

987
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,760
terminal eight eight amino acids we know

988
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,838
that is uh the LMT is still responsive

989
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,079
to aluminum so we're still looking into

990
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,519
we're trying to dissect which which of

991
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,400
this entire Motif actually corresponds

992
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,119
to the part or contains the part that

993
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,960
makes the protein responsible and that's

994
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,079
what we're evaluating at the moment a

995
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,519
whole series of of deletions of this

996
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,640
Motif also what we're testing is we're

997
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:22,039
taking that Motif and we're doing a swap

998
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:24,559
domain on an LMT which is not aluminum

999
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,838
responsive to see if insertion of this

1000
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,639
particular Motif at the end Terminus

1001
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:29,639
will bring back the responsiveness of

1002
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,400
the

1003
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:34,639
protein so overall summarizing what I've

1004
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,519
shown you is we started with a secondary

1005
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,960
prediction of the lmts we've done some

1006
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:42,480
topological work uh and some um Turf

1007
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,159
work indicating they assemble as diers

1008
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,760
uh we know the topology is such that the

1009
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:48,559
both the end and the C domains are

1010
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,920
contained to the inside of the of the

1011
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,358
protein what's still puzzling is if

1012
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,480
aluminum is interacting with the

1013
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,838
protein how come it's interacting with

1014
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,400
domains which are contained within the

1015
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:03,799
inside of the protein right if if the

1016
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,039
especi of aluminum is such that at

1017
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,240
neutral pH is aluminum precipitates as

1018
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,519
is a hydroxide how come aluminum might

1019
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,598
be getting into the cell and interacting

1020
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,679
with motifs located in a in a region

1021
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:21,318
which is basically neutral pH what we

1022
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:23,598
think is we have identified regions

1023
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:27,279
which are involved in the structural

1024
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,559
changes that take place underlying the

1025
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,839
enhan ability of the transporter however

1026
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,839
the regions we have identified are not

1027
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,880
necessarily the regions where aluminum

1028
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:39,880
is interacting directly with the protein

1029
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,160
and all this has been done with any real

1030
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,440
structural knowledge of the L&amp;T uh we

1031
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:48,558
have just done it with uh secondary

1032
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,519
structureal predictions but we are in

1033
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:55,599
urge we need to get a crystal structure

1034
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:58,400
that allow us to place a spe uh spatial

1035
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,480
structure crystal structure a 3D model

1036
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,240
of the lmts to be able to overlap all

1037
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,639
the functionality that we know uh to

1038
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,558
basically to El elucidate what are the

1039
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,960
molecular determinants of the

1040
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,720
functionality of the

1041
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,480
LMT so the other part that I never told

1042
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,000
you about is the other family of

1043
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,838
Transporters the the M Transporters

1044
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,960
which is a complete different story

1045
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:23,119
they're regulated in a different way and

1046
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,679
hopefully one day I'll get the chance to

1047
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,720
talk about it so basically summarizing

1048
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,558
I've shown use sort of uh a set of

1049
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,799
multidisciplinary approaches that have

1050
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,280
allow us to initiate function structure

1051
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,359
analysis of membrane Transporters which

1052
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,280
are involved or mediate a particular

1053
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:42,480
abiotic stress response this knowledge

1054
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,400
will allow us to potentially identify

1055
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,800
the AL of membrane Transporters that are

1056
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,160
most effective in conferring aluminum

1057
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,839
resistance in corrup plants and in the

1058
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:55,118
era of uh genome editing it's it's it's

1059
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:58,318
pretty plausible to propose that we

1060
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,358
should be able with the knowledge of of

1061
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,558
what are the domains that mediate

1062
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,639
aluminum enhancement in a particular uh

1063
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,599
family of Transporters we should be able

1064
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,358
to engineer these membrane Transporters

1065
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,680
in order to enhance their ability to

1066
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,759
confer aluminum tolerance and thereby

1067
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:17,000
expanding their usage in available

1068
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,559
marginal soils so finally I just want to

1069
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,440
acknowledge a lot of people that have

1070
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,200
been invol involved at different parts

1071
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,039
of this

1072
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:27,639
project first of all the Oldtimer in the

1073
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,719
kosing lab thanks for all the help

1074
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:31,239
technical help and intellectual

1075
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:34,000
discussions particularly I want to

1076
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:36,679
acknowledge people from from my group

1077
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,239

1078
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:41,159
part of part of the work as well as

1079

visiting Scholars International visiting

1080
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:45,480
Scholars rotating students from plan

1081
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,640
biology that have collaborated and added

1082
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,838
little bits and pieces to the puzzle as

1083
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,639
well as uh undergrads who have rotated

1084
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,440
during the summer through the plan

1085
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,879
genome research project that bti hosts

1086
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,000
over the summer also

1087
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,680
collaborators Ingo uh Ed they're

1088
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,199
involved in the phenetic analysis as I

1089
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:07,719
mentioned Ed is involved in the turf

1090
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:10,159
work um Jeffrey Chang is our rightand

1091
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:11,719
man uh in regards to fun to the

1092
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,519
structure and crystallization of

1093
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:16,639
Transporters and uh Dave snar and Kula

1094
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:18,559
involved in other work that I hav't

1095
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,358
present so thank you very much I finally

1096
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,079
want to acknowledge the funding from

1097
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:25,440
what used to be NRI nowadays is the is

1098
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,880
the Nea Grant and uh thank you for your

1099
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,880
time

1100
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,400
um have you estimated the single channel

1101
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,280
conductance for

1102
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,079
melee no we

1103
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,680
haven't with with the expression of Al I

1104
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:49,400
haven't done any single

1105
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:52,519
Channel because I looked at your Turf so

1106
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,200
you have some Channel density yeah that

1107
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:58,599
you can estimate and from your IV curves

1108
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:02,199
I guess a melee are going in per

1109
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,079
second so I wonder if you could maybe

1110
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:07,239
estimate you do the correlation yes we

1111
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,599
haven't uh I haven't done any single chw

1112
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:12,039
from uh from experiment to those for

1113
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,680
those that are not familiar basically

1114
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,279
single channel is uh you can actually

1115
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:19,239
isolate a little patch of the membrane

1116
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,200
to measure the activity of the single

1117
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,759
molecule of that

1118
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:27,118
transport and measure the transport rate

1119
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,800
what we did do was uh back in the early

1120
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,119
2000s we did a lot of patch planing

1121
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,359
looking at uh the transport activity

1122
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:39,838
protopass for Maze and from that we

1123
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:42,000
detected a we characterized a Ani

1124
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,519
current which basically accounts for the

1125
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,760
release of intracell uh an into the

1126
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,318
extracell part of the protoplast and we

1127
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,240
did single Channel work with that and I

1128
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:57,440
believe it was a conductance of around

1129
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:59,279
20 to 30 p seens in those conditions and

1130
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,760
what we know is that that channel

1131
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,119
isolated in patches also was dependent

1132
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,599
on the presence of Mr Alum basically the

1133
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,559
the patch is quiet if you remove

1134
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,519
aluminum but as soon as you bring

1135
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:16,040
aluminum seemly CH appears which is

1136
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:19,039
consistent with the activity of but no I

1137
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,400
haven't done any any single Channel Do

1138
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,400
you have do you have any estimates of

1139
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,400
the channel density from the turf

1140
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,919
no

1141
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,960
so I'm curious I know getting a crystal

1142
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,318
startu obviously be a wonderful approach

1143
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,358
to this but in VI of that if you look to

1144
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,079
see whether that inter terminal domain

1145
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:40,759
that you've identifi is potentially to

1146
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,640
be some involvement in aluminum um are

1147
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,680
there similar structures and other

1148
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:48,078
transport proteins involved in C IR

1149
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,799
binding that could give you some Clues

1150
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,960
not for that particular so there's

1151
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,880
something unique about that domain yes

1152
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,358
it's pretty frustrating to work with you

1153
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,960
know this guys when you work like for M

1154
00:47:56,358 --> 00:48:00,039
you just simply put your sequence out

1155
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,318
here and you get three four different

1156
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:04,159
Cales so all you have to do is take your

1157
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,239
sequence thread it through those C

1158
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,920
structures right those predictions you

1159
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:13,719
get nice you throw in Te get nothing

1160
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,280
choing half you throw just the internal

1161
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:20,039
domains nothing it's a family unique

1162
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:24,040
unique to the plan Kingdom all the more

1163
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:27,639
reason to sorry all the more reason to

1164
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,639
get that

1165
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,639
in the LTS uh no I mean yes there are a

1166
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,519
couple of substitutions at least for the

1167
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:47,279
weak one originally they had proposed

1168
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,358
two differents and uh the I think it's

1169
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,240
like two or four me

1170
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:56,639
last um originally they had proposed

1171
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:58,279
from working all sides that uh

1172
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:01,598
there was a functional difference among

1173
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:06,240
them but uh but we have done the work

1174
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:09,640
basically transport same expression so

1175
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:13,000
no we don't which would be nice to have

1176
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:13,000
you know a changing

1177
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,400
phyp well there are no more questions

1178
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:19,400
thank

1179
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,519
