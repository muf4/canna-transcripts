1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:04,839
University

3
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:09,650
all right so what I'm saying is that

4
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:11,089
we're gonna split the talk into two

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,150
halves I'm gonna give the first half

6
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,288
then headed off to Yolanda and the first

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,910
half I'm gonna talk about is a little

8
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:20,059
bit about our position and then mostly

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,440
about New York City and urban

10
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,149
agriculture in New York City and then

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,339
you wander we'll talk about the

12
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:27,368
challenges that we found as we've been

13
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:32,689
working with people over the last year

14
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:35,149
so New York City you haven't you don't

15
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,808
know about it is big it's very big it's

16
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,120
three hundred and four square miles and

17
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:42,619
as far as its sort of physically

18
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,828
compared to upstate New York the winters

19
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,568
are milder the summers are hotter we

20
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:50,808
have a moderating effect of the ocean

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:52,639
being there it's also further south and

22
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:54,768
we have the urban heat island effect and

23
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:56,629
that's a big factor that we're still

24
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:58,068
sort of figuring out what that has to do

25
00:00:56,628 --> 00:01:00,108
with urban agriculture but it can mean

26
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:02,559
for example that in the summertime it

27
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:06,228
means hotter peak temperatures in

28
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,780
afternoon and it means warmer nights in

29
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:10,218
summer so sometimes as much as seven

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,200
degrees Fahrenheit warmer than just

31
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:13,280
outside the city so that that can be a

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,728
big factor that we're still sort of

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,950
figuring out and then also it's

34
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:21,140
obviously very populous biggest city in

35
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,840
the country most densely populated city

36
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,590
in the country and by pretty wide margin

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,469
and very culturally diverse and that

38
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,670
comes with I mean you can see a little

39
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,959
bit from this map which is kind of

40
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,090
overwhelming so I could spend too much

41
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,408
time on it but you can see a little bit

42
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,179
from the each color being different

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,859
racial ethnic groups that there's some

44
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:42,320
segregation built into the end of the

45
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:43,669
city like historical segregation and

46
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,108
structural inequalities that come with

47
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,929
that and that overlays a lot with the

48
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:49,099
work that we do and then there's just

49
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:50,450
high cost of living in the city and

50
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:54,858
that's sort of a fact of life in New

51
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,478
York and it it sort of plays a big role

52
00:01:54,858 --> 00:02:00,288
in a lot of different ways that bourbon

53
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,959
agriculture takes shape as well so our

54
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,939
position we this position was created

55
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,459
just a year ago so we started just a

56
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:09,228
little over a year ago the program

57
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,109
didn't exist before that in the city so

58
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,970
Yolanda and I were hired to be the urban

59
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,500
agriculture specialists in New York City

60
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,879
and basically bring agricultural

61
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,560
extension into into the city

62
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,319
our sort of central focus is to build

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,030
educational programs and and other

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,109
support for commercial urban agriculture

65
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,090
and we'll talk a little bit more about

66
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,270
what what we mean by commercial or what

67
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,860
what the description means but mostly

68
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,340
it's an it's a you know an extension

69
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,840
position doing program development and a

70
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:46,020
lot of individual technical assistance

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:48,629
and manual labor as you can see here we

72
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,180
so New York urban or New York City urban

73
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:56,099
agriculture takes a lot of different

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,969
forms we are dealing primarily with what

75
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,650
we're calling commercial urban

76
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,009
agriculture what we're classifying as

77
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,379
commercial which is for-profit and and

78
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,479
privately owned operations like you

79
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,319
would expect but also includes a lot of

80
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,609
nonprofits which are growing produce and

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,609
selling it and it goes back into their

82
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,660
budgets so we're including them as well

83
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,190
it's a different structure but it's

84
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,949
still we're still calling it commercial

85
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,810
and it also includes a lot of very small

86
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,429
operations backyards and people selling

87
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,930
you know a thousand dollars worth of

88
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,200
tomatoes within their community that

89
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,730
counts as well but beyond that they're

90
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,849
also when I could spends much time on it

91
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:34,139
today but very important other forms of

92
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,000
urban agriculture in the city and

93
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,639
community gardens are really big

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,800
presence I'll talk about that the next

95
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,239
slide but also there a lot of other

96
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,590
nonprofits that aren't selling what

97
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,969
they're growing or aren't selling very

98
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,939
much and most of their food is being

99
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:50,389
donated to schools to food pantries or

100
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,800
just sort of within the community

101
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,509
community gardens are sort of the

102
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,370
foundation of urban agriculture in New

103
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:59,969
York City they've been around for a long

104
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,770
time and I mean a very long time and the

105
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,150
sort of present-day community garden

106
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,880
movement in the city really took off in

107
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,439
the 70s and 80s and had a lot to do with

108
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,879
green space preservation and that

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,240
remains a really important role of

110
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,359
community gardens in the city there are

111
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,120
over 700 in total throughout the city

112
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,040
this map just shows green thumb' gardens

113
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,689
which is sort of the division of the New

114
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,520
York City Parks Department so they run

115
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,719
the largest portion of them but they're

116
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,579
another one or two hundred that aren't

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,380
even on this map but you can see

118
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,180
concentrations of them this is in

119
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:35,129
central and eastern Brooklyn

120
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,530
and in the Bronx and in Harlem so when

121
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,389
we talk about the operations we work

122
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,899
with more often the farms and the market

123
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:45,449
gardens you can see a little bit of

124
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:48,388
overlap where these this blue which is

125
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,478
nonprofit sites and up here to overlap

126
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,860
some with where the gardens are they

127
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,779
tend to be in the similar neighborhoods

128
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,910
and that there's a lot of those to go

129
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,978
hand-in-hand and some of the community

130
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,009
gardens are sort of function as a

131
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:04,288
nonprofit farm which is a whole other

132
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,990
sort of topic but you'll also see that

133
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:09,810
the red dots the for-profit enterprises

134
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,769
are serve a cluster here in northern

135
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,120
Brooklyn and that is a lot of hydroponic

136
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,129
operations that are in this sort of

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,780
industrial zones and then they're

138
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,098
scattered around the city so we've

139
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:25,769
worked we found 34 35 so far and we

140
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:31,800
think there are others that's fit this

141
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:34,918
description so the nonprofit's like I

142
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,259
said they are growing spaces operated by

143
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,209
mission driven nonprofits mission

144
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,209
besides food production

145
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:45,930
so education workforce development food

146
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:48,239
justice to social justice and so some of

147
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,918
the food is sold for project revenue a

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,009
lot of that money goes right back into

149
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,629
paying farm staff so that's one of the

150
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,250
reasons we we do think of it as a

151
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,658
commercial enterprise because it or as a

152
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,189
commercial agriculture because it is

153
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:03,149
economic development a very direct way

154
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:04,560
and one thing that you find that we find

155
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,989
out a lot of the nonprofit operations is

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,240
crops being grown with the neighboring

157
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,408
community in mind often because the

158
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,478
neighboring community is participating

159
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:14,610
and so that includes for example an

160
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,219
eastern or central Brooklyn there's a

161
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,720
large Caribbean community so there are a

162
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,889
lot of amaranth greens growing for

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,539
callaloo bitter melon which was brought

164
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,918
up from the West Indies and all over the

165
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:31,050
city there's a lot of collard greens and

166
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,430
then the other serve category is the

167
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,699
for-profit and privately owned

168
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,579
operations the majority of the indoor

169
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,908
and hydroponic operations fall into this

170
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,939
category but they're also also the soil

171
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:48,709
based rooftop farms are more

172
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:50,839
before profit for profit businesses are

173
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:54,079
more likely to be growing high-value

174
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,789
products in the city so high-end salad

175
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,740
greens like you see here at Gotham

176
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,530
greens Oh actually that's basil well

177
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:05,860
high-end salad greens and herbs they do

178
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:08,659
both and also specialty specialty

179
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,790
enterprises like mushrooms this on the

180
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,720
bottom they grow this is all hot peppers

181
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,340
and then in order to supplement the

182
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,860
revenue because it's difficult to make

183
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:21,829
up the to make enough in income just

184
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,150
from selling produce in the city there

185
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:26,300
will be supplementary revenue from

186
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:29,149
hosting events consulting on other

187
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,520
projects and people people will pay to

188
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:33,439
do tours and workshops on the sites and

189
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,689
also some of these projects especially

190
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,339
the hydroponic ones will have venture

191
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:41,110
capital behind them which we'll get into

192
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:43,639
more so the other way that we sort of

193
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,280
look at the two different or another way

194
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,439
of dividing the the categorizing the

195
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,839
urban agriculture enterprises in this

196
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,810
city is sort of indoor versus outdoor to

197
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,060
kind of oversimplify it and so indoor

198
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,610
being in our case sort of shorthand for

199
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,149
a controlled environment agriculture or

200
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,949
CEA

201
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:03,500
which is an acronym will probably say a

202
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:07,310
few more times this is these mostly

203
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,100
hydroponic operations again greens and

204
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,230
herbs most commonly a lot of them are

205
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,060
startup startup enterprises with

206
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,610
investors investment behind them either

207
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,290
the owner put their own capital into it

208
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,509
and they had a lot of capital or they

209
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,120
brought in venture capital and this

210
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,550
includes a lot of or a few alternative

211
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,168
enterprises which include aquaculture

212
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,450
and mushrooms and I should mention this

213
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:34,218
last this is square roots which is one

214
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,979
that gets a bit of press this is in a

215
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,150
shipping container in Brooklyn there are

216
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,570
a bunch of shipping containers this is

217
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:43,610
just one of them and then the other side

218
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,090
of that operation type being the soil

219
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,919
based or outdoor farms which can be at

220
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,960
ground level or some of them are on

221
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,838
rooftop on rooftops where they brought

222
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,060
the soil up these are more likely to be

223
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,740
nonprofit or maybe they're for-profit

224
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,109
but they have a mission a similar

225
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,659
mission

226
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,039
sort of built into it and they're more

227
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,620
likely to be diversified vegetable

228
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,799
operations so really this this example

229
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,839
here's that and I own family farm is

230
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,729
obviously it's on Staten Island and it's

231
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,800
one that you walk around there and

232
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,360
Augustine the farmer has been there for

233
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,359
twenty years

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,370
it's an acre or so of what it looks like

235
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,690
just a miniaturized diversified

236
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,370
vegetable farm that could have been at

237
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,720
the Hudson Valley and so there are a

238
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,310
number of farms sort of like that in

239
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,600
especially around the edges of the city

240
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,588
where there's more land available and/or

241
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,480
where there's basically any land

242
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:36,360
available that you can farm right into

243
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,889
that ground but there there are a lot of

244
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,470
different source or based operations and

245
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:45,600
so a side note on that is that actually

246
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,450
the majority of these that we found in

247
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,310
the city are not growing in the soil the

248
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,310
native soil on the site and even when it

249
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,958
is native soils very often actually fill

250
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:58,739
dredged it brought in from the bay or

251
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:01,018
construction fill but two-thirds or more

252
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,899
of the sort of soil based sites that we

253
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:06,720
found are growing in imported soils or

254
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,419
sort of soil like media like purchased

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,459
topsoil from from nurseries which is

256
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,309
often mixed with compost or heavily

257
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:16,139
amended afterwards with compost rooftop

258
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:17,789
mixes so the rooftop farms will add some

259
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,259
to have a really lightweight blend in

260
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:21,269
order to meet the weight requirements of

261
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,879
the roof which comes with its own sort

262
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,789
of challenges and then actually the

263
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,220
biggest piece of this pie here is a

264
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:31,469
hundred percent compost which is the

265
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,959
that's the most common single sort of

266
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,060
growing media in the in the city the

267
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,539
city gives away the Department of

268
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,849
Sanitation gives away bagged compost for

269
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,620
free from they're sort of big municipal

270
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,209
compost site so it's a very high carbon

271
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,480
as far as we can tell very high carbon

272
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:51,239
compost a lot of like woodchips and leaf

273
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,100
litter and stuff and so because it's

274
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,539
given away for free a lot of people use

275
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,379
that as their primary growing medium and

276
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,099
that raised a whole lot of other

277
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:02,328
interesting questions which is a

278
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,329
slideshow in itself we won't get into

279
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:06,639
and then so here's a map of those

280
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,798
differentiating those two different

281
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,198
types of operations the lighter green

282
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:13,928
being the the hydroponic and CEA

283
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:16,058
operations darker green about being soil

284
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:17,798
based as you can see that a lot of the

285
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:20,948
dark green dots the soy-based are more

286
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:22,749
around the fringes of the city and the

287
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:27,149
hydroponics are especially in that

288
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:30,298
cluster in northern brooklyn and finally

289
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,889
to divide the sort of looking at the two

290
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:35,678
again indoor/outdoor being a shorthand

291
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:37,859
for those two different groups you can

292
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:40,539
see the difference in enterprises

293
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:42,759
outdoor again um the dark blue is the

294
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:44,918
sort of primary enterprise of slice to

295
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,688
be visited and light blue beings or an

296
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:49,928
additional secondary enterprises or side

297
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:53,498
enterprises so outdoor enterprises or

298
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:56,769
outdoor operations focus on diversified

299
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:57,819
vegetables in almost every case often

300
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,928
because it's part of their mission

301
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:02,108
rather than because it's the most

302
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:04,568
profitable thing and but they also have

303
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:08,049
a whole lot of secondary enterprises

304
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:12,039
including a lot of herbs cut flowers we

305
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:14,350
see honey and eggs and some perennial

306
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:17,110
fruits to indoor enterprises are more

307
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,739
focused less diversified and again

308
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,100
focusing on high-value for the space and

309
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:26,879
high turnover so herbs especially basil

310
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,619
high end salad greens mostly lettuce and

311
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,869
microgreens and then a few alternative

312
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:33,489
enterprises so we see some room for

313
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:35,860
growth or additional enterprises down

314
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:39,278
the road in especially fish or

315
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,749
aquaculture and mushrooms and there's

316
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,769
one person growing spirulina and we'll

317
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:49,089
see how that goes so at this point I'm

318
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:50,528
gonna head it off to Yolanda all right I

319
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,829
don't have a mic so I'm just gonna be

320
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:55,568
using this so now that we have kind of a

321
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:58,418
general overview the different types of

322
00:12:55,568 --> 00:13:00,668
urban agriculture this portion is gonna

323
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:02,918
be focusing on the challenges both soil

324
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:06,428
based and CEA controlled environment

325
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:10,149
agriculture so when we started about a

326
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:11,619
year ago in October of 2017 we really

327
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,448
wanted to get a better sense of how we

328
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:15,990
were gonna direct our efforts in New

329
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:18,120
York City so we conducted an in-form

330
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,399
all needs assessment and we visited and

331
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,769
interviewed 25 different commercial

332
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,230
operations had discussions with other

333
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:28,139
stakeholders including non commercial

334
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,420
farms and gardens and also consulted

335
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,028
with a few urban AG leaders may be

336
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,129
familiar with Karen Washington and other

337
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:38,820
AG service providers in the city like

338
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:41,009
grow NYC and just food and we also did

339
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,100
some background research on other urban

340
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,509
AG surveys and assessments may be

341
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,120
familiar with the five borough farm

342
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:50,309
project just to build off of what's

343
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:56,580
already the research that's already

344
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:57,929
taking place so the challenges can

345
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,870
really be summed into three main

346
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:03,509
categories space funding and knowledge

347
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,089
and these upcoming slides are just gonna

348
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,909
dive deeper into the specifics of each

349
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:11,490
of those challenges so within soil based

350
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,259
operations space is obviously a huge

351
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,940
issue

352
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:17,189
the lack of ground-level space we talked

353
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,350
about how in the periphery of New York

354
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,680
City and Staten Island Randall's Island

355
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,889
you have more open space but in

356
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,049
Manhattan Brooklyn part yeah mostly

357
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:30,778
Manhattan Brooklyn Queens space is more

358
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:34,019
limited so the lack of ground-level

359
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:39,899
space is an issue physical challenges

360
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:43,049
Sam mentioned oftentimes the soil is

361
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,179
contaminated by heavy metals so a lot of

362
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,490
times the soil needs to be imported

363
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:51,389
there's also shade from nearby buildings

364
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,889
which is a challenge for growing in the

365
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:55,230
city and like we mentioned this is

366
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:58,289
hellgate farm they're going on a quarter

367
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,480
acre on a rooftop and primarily produce

368
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:04,578
hot peppers that is formed into

369
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,528
value-added products like hot sauces and

370
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:12,659
pepper infused honey and interesting

371
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:15,659
products like that again a space is a

372
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:18,049
challenge within CEA operations the cost

373
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,338
of space is a high barrier of entry

374
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,809
regulation and building codes kind of

375
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,230
understanding what's permissible and

376
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,229
what's not

377
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,078
so within soy based operations

378
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:34,649
oftentimes operating on limited funds

379
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,179
this leads to low salaries the cost of

380
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,360
living is really high in New York City

381
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,638
so often times it also leads to fire

382
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,970
manager turnover so that makes it

383
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,919
difficult for us to because they're

384
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:50,879
within one season there could be too far

385
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:54,360
managers at a site and so there's that

386
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,639
kind of differentiates or like extension

387
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,639
work in the city versus in a rural

388
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,709
context where if we were upstate we'd be

389
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,079
primarily working with farm owners and

390
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,719
building that relationship over time but

391
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,219
with the farm manager tone turnover

392
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,319
there's also loss of institutional

393
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,269
knowledge and kind of have to start over

394
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:15,838
all over again so that makes it

395
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,060
difficult for us and also I'm sure for

396
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,589
the organization's as well

397
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,469
this also leads to difficulty in

398
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:27,000
investing infrastructure and just sort

399
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,920
of scaling up the operation this is a

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,620
picture of the youth farm in Brooklyn

401
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:37,919
and they're actually using the front

402
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:40,139
space of a high school funds is like I

403
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,649
mentioned within the CEA operations as a

404
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,990
high startup cost difficult to enter the

405
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,389
space the returns may be too little or

406
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,579
too late in terms of some of the

407
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:57,060
investments that are that have been made

408
00:16:50,578 --> 00:17:00,388
by venture capitalists knowledge so this

409
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,609
is the third mean category of the

410
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,669
challenges in New York City there's sort

411
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,318
of two backgrounds and mindsets of

412
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,569
gardening versus production and there's

413
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,318
a steep learning curve in terms of what

414
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:17,009
you need to know to be able to sell to a

415
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,928
market so oftentimes there's just a gap

416
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:22,318
in knowledge about efficiency and

417
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,500
marketing so that's sort of lacking with

418
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,418
gardeners that come into this space and

419
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,240
also just learning technical skills on

420
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:33,090
the fly and just having a general sense

421
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,269
of the technical production knowledge

422
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:36,919
that's needed

423
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:40,639
this is a beekeeping workshop in the

424
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,410
Bronx we have a group called crafts in

425
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,000
New York in New York City and crafts

426
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,980
stands for collaborative regional

427
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,549
Alliance for farmer training so this is

428
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,769
one way that farmers are started getting

429
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,389
the technical knowledge and doing

430
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:58,299
peer-to-peer learning and learning from

431
00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:01,130
other operations in the city and again

432
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,470
knowledge within CEA operations there's

433
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,840
a sort of a lack of information sharing

434
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,430
so there's a sphere of within tech

435
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,519
growers that they're sort of reinventing

436
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,750
the wheel and this comes from having

437
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,420
proprietary mindset a lot of these

438
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,789
companies are really tech companies and

439
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,480
so they just come at it from a different

440
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:21,980
perspective and oftentimes this results

441
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,279
in the lack of experienced growers and

442
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,289
decision making roles folks that have a

443
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:33,799
lot of that experience managing larger

444
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:36,230
scale operations test pests and disease

445
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,000
pressure so at least in New York City

446
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,589
some of the most common insect pests

447
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,380
that we saw were flea beetles and

448
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:44,449
Harlequin bugs on brassicas to spot a

449
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,020
spider mite on tomatoes and other crops

450
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,500
and as well as foliar diseases bacterial

451
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:53,389
spot on tomatoes and bacterial bacterial

452
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,750
speck on tomatoes and bacterial spot on

453
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,750
peppers and really in the city there's a

454
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,730
big focus on organic controls and that

455
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,299
sort of follows in line with the values

456
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,339
and the mission of a lot of these

457
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:11,480
operations so they tend to be more

458
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:14,929
organic than conventional this is a

459
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,599
Harlequin bug on broccoli and this also

460
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,660
just shows the differences with upstate

461
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,490
New York with upstate and downstate some

462
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:27,259
of the pests and disease pressures are

463
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:30,009
different given the warmer climates so

464
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:33,400
next steps right now we're taking on

465
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:36,109
both shared and individual projects so

466
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,710
providing individual ta technical

467
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:42,229
assistance to urban growers sometimes

468
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,390
through email but other times through

469
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,690
social media a big platform for us is

470
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,130
Instagram we find that that's where

471
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,210
we're able to do the most

472
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,710
reach to our target audience and also

473
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,750
focusing on production oriented

474
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,150
workshops and small group learning as we

475
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,640
head into the winter and this is sort of

476
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:05,540
the downtime for farmers we're entering

477
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,620
that grower meeting season I'm taking on

478
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,990
food safety

479
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:11,959
some CEA controlled environment

480
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,480
agriculture operations are focusing on

481
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,980
GAAP certification so that they can

482
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,059
enter new markets Sam is going to

483
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:24,920
continue his work on soil survey and

484
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:27,579
yeah so this photo right here is vets

485
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,820
and vets dye campaign against hunger

486
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:35,359
it's there Saratoga farm in Brooklyn and

487
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:37,849
this is an example of on-site ta so us

488
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:43,219
going out and helping farmers

489
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:47,389
individually in person so next steps a

490
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,519
few upcoming projects this is a picture

491
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,090
of a mushroom workshop at La Finca deals

492
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,579
for and in the Bronx I'm continuing work

493
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:58,159
on specialty mushroom production in the

494
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:59,990
city so I've applied to a couple federal

495
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,870
grants to create a network of mushroom

496
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,500
educators throughout New York City we're

497
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:09,769
also trying to connect CEA growers sort

498
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,230
of fostering more collaboration and

499
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:15,289
network sharing amongst this group that

500
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,809
tends to be our priority area based so

501
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:21,049
that is done you like through meetups

502
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:23,450
and roundtables we're also trying to

503
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:26,180
find more sites for research and field

504
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,370
trials as well as well as developing a

505
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:32,720
newsletter where we can sort of continue

506
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:34,549
to do this outreach to our network and

507
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,259
our target audience of commercial

508
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:41,619
growers in the city and so this is our

509
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:43,759
Instagram handle we have over 500

510
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:49,479
followers right now and our email

511
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:49,480
addresses and yeah that's about it

512
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:58,159
[Applause]

513
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:16,759
okay so the question was about markets

514
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:20,480
and the different marketing outlets that

515
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:22,990
these operations sell into so it really

516
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,519
varies from operation to operation but

517
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:28,519
I'll give you an example Brooklyn Grange

518
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,349
has a farm stand like on the weekends

519
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,288
and so folks come up to the rooftop and

520
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:37,119
buy their produce there they also have a

521
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:40,250
CSA I don't know how big that CSA is

522
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:44,839
they also sell to a company called local

523
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:51,319
roots NYC that's an online CSA website

524
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:53,750
and online buying platform and actually

525
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:57,589
it's interesting in their third site in

526
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,648
Sunset Park a school knew that they were

527
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:03,769
opening up and so they asked them to

528
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:05,869
start a CSA for the school so just sort

529
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,638
of with that brand recognition and the

530
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:11,048
publicity that they get around being in

531
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:15,288
a city sometimes folks come to them for

532
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:17,418
CSA and it's like a lot of other things

533
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:21,158
or like the sort of general theme of

534
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:23,720
these urban agriculture in New York is a

535
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,159
no to operations being the same and so

536
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,558
they're all these sort of creative

537
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,269
marketing approaches people are taking

538
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:31,548
so I got from greens you point out

539
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,109
before is on top of the Whole Foods and

540
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:35,619
they just walk it down into those foods

541
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:38,928
most places obviously don't have that

542
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:41,418
more often it'll be on site yeah farm

543
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,580
stands a lot of the nonprofit's so that

544
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,820
way and the a lot of the nonprofits have

545
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:49,128
CSAs and I think a lot of times that's

546
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,509
partly just because it's a way of

547
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,339
engaging the community it's not

548
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:53,360
necessarily the most profitable way they

549
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:55,069
get rid of stuff because now you're

550
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,979
growing all this squash and stuff that

551
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,408
takes up a lot of space but it gets

552
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:05,259
people engaged and yeah you don't see a

553
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:08,210
lot of urban growers at green markets

554
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:10,339
probably because of scale and a lot of

555
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,840
cases or because they already have their

556
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:14,209
markets bend down like that the

557
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,679
higher-end places are selling directly

558
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,019
to restaurants a lot of time so like

559
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,960
Gotham greens or like I'm Brooklyn

560
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:22,789
Grange I mean so I mean that's a huge

561
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,120
market in the city there chefs like to

562
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:28,129
buy directly and and to have to be able

563
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,619
to say we bought from somebody down the

564
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,150
street is you know when it when local is

565
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:34,069
a big thing that's hyper locally you

566
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,990
know you the only one who gets to say

567
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:37,849
that you bought stuff in from somebody

568
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,950
in the same borough that you're in and

569
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,750
some restaurants have Gardens on the

570
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,819
rooftops and a couple of them have sort

571
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,259
of like a small like a like a Market

572
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:48,710
Garden on the rooftop we haven't worked

573
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,599
with them as much yeah restaurants I've

574
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,370
mentioned that one but restaurants make

575
00:24:50,599 --> 00:25:13,189
up a huge portion of the sales a lot of

576
00:24:52,369 --> 00:25:15,589
times what the advantage is okay I think

577
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,360
we sort of touch a little bit of on that

578
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:21,619
I think a lot of it is just sort of like

579
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,659
this cool factor and it's novel and it's

580
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,459
different and so they can kind of play

581
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,400
up on that in terms of the mark in a

582
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,400
marketing sense and it's not just local

583
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,240
it's hyper local and the advantage is

584
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,100
that it also allows people to sort of

585
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,349
learn more about where their food comes

586
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:41,119
from how it's grown and really engaged

587
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:44,509
with the food system so there's that

588
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,959
aspect as well yeah and most of these

589
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:50,809
farms I guess you wouldn't probably say

590
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,730
that somebody just went to New York City

591
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,500
in order to start a farm necessarily

592
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,990
maybe with some of the indoor or some of

593
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,720
the startups and in that case it's

594
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,279
probably about being close to Talent or

595
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,269
having you know about the people that

596
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,139
they're hiring and that's where those

597
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:08,299
people want to live but for a lot of the

598
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,160
projects it's that people work this is

599
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,559
where they were already living and in a

600
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,420
city of eight and a half million people

601
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,829
it's hard to find a way to sort of you

602
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,149
know if you want to get out and get your

603
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:19,608
hands dirty

604
00:26:17,148 --> 00:26:22,218
it can be tricky to find that and there

605
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:24,499
are community gardens but a lot of it

606
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:25,909
seems like it's people who already lived

607
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,308
there and want to do something but they

608
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:29,419
don't want to move out of the city so

609
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:31,989
figure out how to farm in the city

610
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:34,009
mm-hmm it's not it's not a place that

611
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:35,538
you would probably travel from far and

612
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,969
wide because it's the best place to farm

613
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:54,048
you know like it's got a lot obviously a

614
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:56,359
lot of challenges okay so the question

615
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:59,838
was with a lot of these operations if

616
00:26:56,358 --> 00:27:02,019
they're any farm owners or are they

617
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:05,048
primarily renting or leasing the space

618
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:09,848
primarily renting or leasing the space

619
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:12,668
they work out some sort of contract or

620
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:15,439
negotiation with the building owner and

621
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:18,469
that arrangement looks different with

622
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,509
every operation there was a hydroponic

623
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:24,588
facility on top of a portable housing

624
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:26,450
unit a building owner in the case of

625
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:29,628
Gotham greens is Whole Foods so they

626
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,580
have their own relationship Hellgate

627
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:34,728
farm that picked that photo that I

628
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:37,368
mentioned where they're growing peppers

629
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:40,159
hot peppers that's like it was like

630
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:41,238
through a friend I'm trying to think of

631
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,849
other arrangements

632
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:50,558
it's hard to think of any case where the

633
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:53,689
operator owns the land land is just

634
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:56,628
really expensive and there's I'm not

635
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:59,088
sure mathematically you can make it work

636
00:27:56,628 --> 00:28:00,259
as a business if you need to purchase

637
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:02,148
the property first

638
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:03,288
except maybe there might be some areas

639
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:06,048
around the fringes or something

640
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:07,759
it's unless there's some sort of support

641
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:10,158
for that and there isn't it's something

642
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,659
we've talked about a little bit with

643
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,759
some people is this idea of you know

644
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,589
what would AG preservation you know

645
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,118
restrictions look like in New York City

646
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:19,519
but I'm chuckling but it's a real

647
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:20,598
question like maybe we could maybe there

648
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,088
is something around maybe there could be

649
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:24,468
something that looks like purchasing

650
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:27,588
development rights or something that

651
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:29,450
that makes a an incentive to actually

652
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:30,159
farm somewhere and maybe even own the

653
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,140
land but

654
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,610
as it is it's long-term ideally

655
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,950
long-term lease arrangements is the best

656
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:38,079
that most people are yeah most people

657
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,470
can get and yeah that's mostly what it

658
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:44,199
is oh what's so good just a lot of it is

659
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:47,470
on parks land that's what one of the

660
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,539
common probably the most common like

661
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,850
landowner for these operations and so

662
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:54,149
the community gardens very often are on

663
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:57,219
parks land green thumb is part of parks

664
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,800
but also parks owned some properties

665
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,150
that were sort of grandfathered into the

666
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,279
green thumb program that were bigger and

667
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,170
that are community farms or nonprofits

668
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,349
and there are a couple of examples of

669
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:11,320
for-profit farms that are on parks lands

670
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:12,969
as well yeah and also um I was just

671
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,879
gonna make comment about we've taught a

672
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,430
farm so the example that I gave up

673
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,610
Brooklyn Grange been flaner the director

674
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:23,850
of agriculture there and the co-founder

675
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:26,169
he did a lot of cold calls so he sort of

676
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:29,439
focused on areas that would be able to

677
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:33,580
have the adequate weight bearing

678
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,039
capacity so he folks first had a

679
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:37,720
location in Long Island City and then

680
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,180
the second one it was in the Navy Yard

681
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,809
so focusing on buildings that can

682
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:46,720
withstand that kind of load and it was

683
00:29:43,809 --> 00:30:14,950
really just cold calling just there's no

684
00:29:46,720 --> 00:30:19,150
like directory to really go off of yeah

685
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,710
so they were part of the 25 yeah I don't

686
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,750
know if they were included in the 25 but

687
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,990
we definitely did visit a lot of the

688
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:29,019
tentacle gardens where we didn't mention

689
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:32,950
this but we are co-located with the USDA

690
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:35,289
and Agra markets on the same floor and

691
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,410
our building at 55 pounds in in Fort

692
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:40,089
Greene and I'm trying to think of

693
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,680
specific collaborations are probably so

694
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,319
many right now there are too many yeah

695
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,600
yeah

696
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,519
our time is talking with with

697
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,059
stakeholders all over the city and it's

698
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,619
very often I mean you're mentioning like

699
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,500
working food insecure neighborhoods so

700
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:58,229
it's very often it's justice oriented or

701
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,359
social justice racial justice sort of

702
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,910
all combined into food justice um

703
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,339
that's maybe the one of the biggest

704
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,620
umbrellas of the different organizations

705
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,619
we work with and I know they're probably

706
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:12,799
at least 20 that we could rattle off but

707
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,969
also and then there's also other farmer

708
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,500
other sort of farmers support that was

709
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,180
in place so there's community garden

710
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,289
support green thumb being the biggest

711
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:25,049
player there and we're we're mostly sort

712
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,670
of letting them do that because they're

713
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,099
like we said there are hundreds of

714
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,390
community gardens so that two of us

715
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:32,250
would be pretty tough for us to keep up

716
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,970
with that and green thumb sort of has it

717
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,950
covered in any ways but there's also

718
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,690
grow NYC which is a city program they

719
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,110
have a program called farm roots which

720
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,400
is a farmer training a farmer training

721
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,319
initiative that they've had for a number

722
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,660
of years and there's a program called

723
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,019
the farm school which is another sort of

724
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:54,210
urban farmer training program and so

725
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:56,029
those are both sort of in place from run

726
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,970
as you know they're nonprofits or city

727
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:01,259
programs for farmer training where it's

728
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,690
still there's such a big city that

729
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:07,680
there's room there's a lot of room for

730
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,720
you know for more players and so part of

731
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,830
what we've been doing in working with a

732
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
lot of these stakeholders is figuring

733
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:14,490
out how we can support them and that as

734
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,799
we enter the space where a lot of people

735
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,109
have already been a lot of our role

736
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,909
right now is support for all sorts of

737
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:23,490
other groups figuring out how we can

738
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:32,880
support other groups rather than trying

739
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:35,220
to do what they're already doing yeah I

740
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,810
mean we've been working with some

741
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,160
Botanical Gardens I mean they sort of

742
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,779
have their own gardening they're another

743
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,820
place that work more with gardeners I

744
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,680
guess then and farmers but we've

745
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,179
definitely been visiting them and we

746
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,990
have we have people we work with there

747
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:55,500
yeah USDA I guess less directly but we

748
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:57,059
do we do have USDA FSA on our floor who

749
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,299
works with a lot of the same people that

750
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:14,819
we

751
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:17,250
so we do collaborate there so the

752
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,099
question was on what the mission is of

753
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,200
these mission based groups right and if

754
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:39,389
it's what were the examples that you

755
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:41,130
were saying yeah a lot of it is so the

756
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,100
one one of the big missions is food

757
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:47,100
access is growing food to either either

758
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:49,189
just to be donated or to be sold at a

759
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:51,179
lower price than you'd normally find it

760
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,710
and also to go culturally appropriate

761
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,970
food so that's where like amaranth and

762
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,500
bitter melon and things like that come

763
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,420
in you stuff that's hard to find the

764
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:01,109
grocery store that the surrounding

765
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,900
community really would like to have and

766
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:08,759
has been asking for and so yeah amaranth

767
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:10,559
is a really popular thing and so that's

768
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,169
why it's a food access being one part of

769
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,110
it access to healthy food a lot of that

770
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:17,898
is educational and that's the other sort

771
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,190
of overlapping big mission is education

772
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:21,659
so there's a lot of youth programming a

773
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,610
lot of summer programs you know summer

774
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,349
obviously lines up nicely with the

775
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,760
growing season so there's a lot of

776
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:29,789
summer programming on a lot of these

777
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,050
farms I want to say probably most of the

778
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:34,860
nonprofit's have some sort of summer

779
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:37,110
youth programming where kids the high

780
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:41,579
schoolers or younger are there you know

781
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,380
working on the farm every day and by the

782
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,849
end still a lot of overlap between the

783
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,349
different missions and so and they're

784
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,599
served general admissions of empowerment

785
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,130
of empowering the local community and

786
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,730
providing green space and providing a

787
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:56,369
public space writing providing gathering

788
00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:00,389
places yeah like two examples that come

789
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:01,829
to mind one is the nonprofit like sister

790
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,949
organization of Brooklyn Grange is

791
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:06,090
called City growers and so they host

792
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,069
educational tours for school-aged

793
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,860
children to come primarily from

794
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:14,160
low-income public housing neighbor

795
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:16,620
so that's one example Randall's Island

796
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:21,409
bird farm they're located close to

797
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:24,659
Harlem so they focus their educational

798
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:27,210
tours and their mission is outreach to

799
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,769
that community and you mentioned

800
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,110
workforce development and that is one as

801
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:33,360
well right next to Randall's Island

802
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:36,240
urban farm is a project eats Ward's

803
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,820
Island they have a lot of program like

804
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,069
sort of job training programs for

805
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:44,160
returning citizens so there's a like a

806
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:46,140
culinary program there on the island and

807
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,949
men who've recently recently

808
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:51,299
incarcerated men will come and and a

809
00:35:49,949 --> 00:36:14,730
couple days a week will come and do job

810
00:35:51,300 --> 00:36:16,860
training stuff there I wouldn't say that

811
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,460
we have hard numbers on that but we do

812
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,110
ask and when we you know sort of bring

813
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,940
up this question um have you tested your

814
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:27,750
soil people the first thing that they

815
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,369
think of is they're thinking a test for

816
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,289
heavy metals they're not thinking about

817
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:32,880
nutrients at all so that's something

818
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,730
that's very much on the forefront of

819
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,579
their minds but I would say most of

820
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:41,429
operations have tested their soils we

821
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,559
just don't know exactly how many yeah I

822
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:46,619
mean the the common approach is to

823
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,559
assume that your soils contaminated

824
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,329
right and to just bring it right off the

825
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,219
bat you know maybe put down landscape

826
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:54,779
fabric and bring in soil on top of it

827
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:56,699
that's probably the most common approach

828
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,350
and that's sort of the that's worthy of

829
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,719
the the community garden approach of the

830
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,579
green thumb general approach now and I

831
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,769
think since they're so intertwined

832
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,569
especially with a lot of nonprofit farms

833
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:10,440
that people replicate that as a best

834
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:12,180
practice but ya know it's it's that's a

835
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:20,579
big sort of ever-present question for

836
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:23,839
all the soil based folks starting to

837
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,840
finds the materials of

838
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:33,309
that's a good lead-in project yeah that

839
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:35,710
we're starting to connect with so that

840
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:38,139
okay so first the question if they're

841
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,619
having trouble accessing stuff accessing

842
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:42,848
growing medium generally I think I mean

843
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:45,550
that's why people grow in out percent

844
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,650
compost is because they can get it for

845
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,910
free the city you can drop it off maybe

846
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,710
it might not be dropped off when they

847
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:52,779
want it but they get it and it's free

848
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,858
and they don't have to pay hundreds or

849
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,930
thousands of dollars to have it

850
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:59,469
delivered in from nursery out of the

851
00:37:55,929 --> 00:38:01,750
city so there's that it was just another

852
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:05,108
just having the money but so there's a

853
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,599
good project that's being started up

854
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:09,519
called the what's called pure soil NYC

855
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,170
but build on what's called the clean

856
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:15,070
soil bank that already exists in the

857
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:17,980
city no back yeah is there slime yeah it

858
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,869
was early on when we talked about manual

859
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,059
labor that's right

860
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:23,740
that's where we were working on yeah

861
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:30,549
that's what this is right

862
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:31,929
so this was a this is a test site so

863
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,880
okay I'll back up the clean the clean

864
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:35,319
soil bank is a project that sort of

865
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,079
already existed in the city it was being

866
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,480
being rolled out which is which wasn't

867
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,759
for growing space it was just for clean

868
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,280
fill so the idea being that the topsoil

869
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,869
if you assume that the top however many

870
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,820
feet are contaminated that below that

871
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,500
because lead especially isn't that

872
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,809
mobile soil that if you go deep enough

873
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,989
it's not going to be contaminated and

874
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:58,659
yeah it's clean in that way right hence

875
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:00,489
the name so for people who needed to do

876
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:03,670
like build a berm in front you know by

877
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:05,949
the ocean or there's something needed

878
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,530
who needed fill material that they knew

879
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:11,108
was was free of contaminants then they

880
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,730
would get stuff being dug up from a

881
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:14,858
foundation of a construction site which

882
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,909
is obviously it's happening all the time

883
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:18,489
all around the city there's all this

884
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:20,230
clean so being dug up and being hauled

885
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:22,329
out of the city and dumped in and up

886
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,599
somewhere in new jersey probably we

887
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:28,269
assume it's almost the second stone and

888
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,430
and so it just gets trucked out of the

889
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:33,070
city and then trucked back in for people

890
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:34,929
who are needful so they were setting up

891
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,940
this Bank to connect them directly so

892
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:38,489
that it would go to

893
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,050
from one site to another it's not much

894
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:42,359
used for gardeners because as soil is

895
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,850
you know totally free of organic matter

896
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:48,840
basically and and you know lifeless

897
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:50,159
essentially and so this idea for the

898
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,079
pure soil and when I see that the

899
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,119
governor's off to the I'm not government

900
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,480
the mayor's yeah office of environmental

901
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,730
remediation is is putting together is to

902
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,829
take that soil take this sort of like

903
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,740
best that they can find at that soil not

904
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:06,809
exactly sure how that's figured and

905
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:09,539
makes it with compost and then deliver

906
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:14,549
that for growing in so that's what's

907
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:17,039
happening here we're helping to mix that

908
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:21,110
mix the clean field that's a I think a

909
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:23,400
pile of the fill with compost and so

910
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,840
somebody that we that we've worked it's

911
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,190
a little bit in the city's it was doing

912
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,710
this trial trying like zero percent

913
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,269
compost you know ten twenty thirty and

914
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,500
see and growing stuff in and seeing the

915
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,820
difference and you definitely can see

916
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,030
the difference zero percent does not

917
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,160
it's not work very well although a

918
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,760
little bit better than you'd expect but

919
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,699
not very well

920
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,070
and so up there so finding that sort of

921
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,960
like sweet spot of what's the ratio of

922
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,900
course the compost and the fill are not

923
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,280
uniform around you know the sources are

924
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,070
not gonna be uniform so it's all gonna

925
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,019
be a little bit approximate but we want

926
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:58,230
to weave in try anyways to work with

927
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:00,869
them and we're talking about maybe some

928
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:04,050
some field trials to figure out like how

929
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:06,839
to make use of that soil and how how can

930
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,100
you make that work it's not we're not

931
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,110
gonna come in and say don't do it cuz

932
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:12,179
they're gonna do it we want to come in

933
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:29,780
and figure out how we can help make it

934
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:37,190
work yeah yeah places being located near

935
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:37,190
cultural communities are constraints

936
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,309
[Music]

937
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,960
in terms of community gardens or the

938
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,088
commercial operations are both just why

939
00:41:49,960 --> 00:42:00,519
so much of Brooklyn kind of a desert

940
00:41:52,088 --> 00:42:02,469
there's so many so for community gardens

941
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:06,429
well so that big empty area in southern

942
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:08,739
Brooklyn is more sort of yards and it's

943
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:09,519
just different it's a I mean we've been

944
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,919
wondering the same thing

945
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,179
yeah to extent yeah and yeah just

946
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,309
looking at it now like Bay Ridge

947
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:19,480
Sheepshead Bay they're tense it tends to

948
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:20,799
be more presidential and you would think

949
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,329
that there would be more urban AG

950
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,310
happening in those areas but I think I'm

951
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:30,098
not really sure the cluster but the

952
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:33,670
cluster of so the clusters in the Bronx

953
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:37,660
Harlem and central and eastern Brooklyn

954
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:40,599
correspond very closely with the earlier

955
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:42,129
crazy colored map that those are

956
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,890
historically black communities that were

957
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,150
present day and historically and so a

958
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:47,769
lot of work has been focused there

959
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:50,139
because those are areas that had been

960
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:53,019
systematically underserved for for

961
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:56,139
decades and so now that's one thing is

962
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:57,460
that that people you know sort of in

963
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:00,098
some cases pushing back against

964
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,550
development and gentrification is a huge

965
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:04,980
huge factor in a lot of these places

966
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,730
have gone into neighborhoods where

967
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,050
people had started up their own

968
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,789
community gardens in a lot of cases I

969
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,869
mean the Bronx definitely but also in

970
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:12,759
Brooklyn people had started up their own

971
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:15,579
community gardens and just vacant lots

972
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,290
and then developers that started to make

973
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:19,989
the surrounding community more desirable

974
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:21,550
and developers started want to move in

975
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:24,639
and of course the open spot is the

976
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:26,530
garden and so that's one of the ways

977
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,569
that that the community garden movement

978
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,700
has played a really big role in the city

979
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,260
is in basically just fighting developers

980
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:36,219
they've been fighting against developers

981
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,690
for you know 40 or 50 years now so I

982
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:39,338
know that's sort of a long long way

983
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,950
around it but yeah and when you think

984
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:45,338
about historically community gardens

985
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:47,649
were sort of like a reaction of the

986
00:43:45,338 --> 00:43:50,320
economic crisis happening in the 80s in

987
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,780
New York City and so a lot of times it

988
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,260
was just it was survival it was trying

989
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:58,000
to have some open space so that you can

990
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:02,280
grow your own produce and just be able

991
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,280
to survive in really difficult times

992
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:10,160
one more question and I just like to ask

993
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:21,999
what are your hopes for York City in the

994
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:24,768
next five years that's a big question

995
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:27,318
you know well um

996
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:28,909
something that comes to mind there's a

997
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:35,239
lot of work right now happening in the

998
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:37,068
policy realm so we would hope to see at

999
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,929
least for me and maybe I could speak for

1000
00:44:37,068 --> 00:44:42,228
you is bridging this divide between

1001
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:45,288
civil based groups and CEA controlled

1002
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:47,929
environment agriculture groups so there

1003
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:50,180
tends to be this divide where a you know

1004
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:56,748
mission-driven versus profit-driven

1005
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:58,639
and it has been at times contentious so

1006
00:44:56,748 --> 00:45:01,218
we would like to see within the next

1007
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:04,670
five years those groups working with one

1008
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:09,199
another and collaborating and not being

1009
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,729
so divided yeah that's a big bit that

1010
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,229
was something we started noticing

1011
00:45:10,728 --> 00:45:15,649
I mean before we even started our job

1012
00:45:12,228 --> 00:45:21,189
and has been a constant sort of presence

1013
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:24,249
in in our work yeah and maybe just a

1014
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:26,838
sort of stability I guess in in

1015
00:45:24,248 --> 00:45:28,368
something that would give in this was

1016
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:31,869
also sort of would go to policy I guess

1017
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,869
but if we're talking about hopes

1018
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:37,489
community gardens have this challenge

1019
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:39,619
but a lot of the soil based farms as

1020
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:41,170
well like just tenure just because you

1021
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:45,890
could don't own the land a sort of

1022
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:48,199
tenuous situation and exists there and

1023
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:50,538
then on top of that just the funding

1024
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:53,599
challenges so for the mission different

1025
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:56,539
farms funding is a challenge in almost

1026
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,459
every case if not every single case and

1027
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:00,019
so if there's you know maybe a more

1028
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:02,899
secure funding stream or something and

1029
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:05,118
and we we look for you know how we can

1030
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,949
help all these projects and if they're

1031
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,239
bottom if it's for property we're trying

1032
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:09,920
to help the bottom line a lot of times

1033
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,318
that's sort of an easy that's you know

1034
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,690
easy way for us to everything for us to

1035
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:17,429
focus on but with the nonprofits that

1036
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,358
I'm talking about it more cuz it's sort

1037
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:22,169
of it's a little more complicated I

1038
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:24,690
guess we're just trying to figure how we

1039
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,420
can support like what does it support

1040
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:30,480
look like if the end goal is more about

1041
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,769
just staying open or about or if there's

1042
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,329
a justice mission like how do we support

1043
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:37,619
that mission yeah I don't know I have a

1044
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:39,450
lot of questions and I have a my hope in

1045
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:47,099
five years is to have answers to all the

1046
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:49,529
questions I just have yeah this has been

1047
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:54,200
a production of Cornell University on

1048
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,200
the web at Cornell edu
