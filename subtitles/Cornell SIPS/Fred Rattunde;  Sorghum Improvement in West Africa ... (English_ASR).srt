let me introduce

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,679
the two of them starting with our

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,718
speaker fred and i just want to say

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,439
at the outset here that um back in 2015

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
the pair of them received a tremendous

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,280
honor of the us von liebig award for

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,320
world nutrition so it was a

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,679
huge uh honor from the german uh

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,359
government and um or maybe i'm wrong

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,840
that it's a government but but a huge

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,879
huge honor there recognizing lifetime

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
achievement

31
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,359
for this very distinguished pair and

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,439
they'd also received the king bowdoin

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,400
award for pearl millet breeding in the

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,559
past so

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,520
um extremely um accomplished

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
pair of breeders for dryland cereals so

37
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,079
uh

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,478
starting with fred um fred um

39
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,200
is from wisconsin and the the two of

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,359
them are

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,520
still associated or now have been since

42
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,560
2016 associated with the university of

43
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,359
wisconsin where

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
fred's from and one of their daughters

45
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,560
is

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,680
currently uh there in wisconsin and the

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
others there with them

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
uh the fred and never currently in

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,439
germany where it was from

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
so uh fred got his master's in phd from

51
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,359
iowa state

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,880
back in the 80s and then um got a he'd

53
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,000
gotten his bachelor's at university of

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,718
wisconsin

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
uh then he did a dairy internship peace

56
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,158
corps

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,200
in ecuador um worked at the university

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,600
of iowa in 80 early 80s an oat breeding

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
then in the mid 80s started working on

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,478
pearl miller breeding with icarusa in

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
india

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
the international center for research on

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
this emory tropics

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
uh and then did a postdoc back in

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,080
hohnheim in germany

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
working on rye breeding and then since

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
the

68
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,639
early 90s have been back with the inter

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
international research

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
uh center for research in the summer air

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
tropics echo said

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,319
first for some years in india working in

73
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,280
rajasthan

74
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,958
and then for almost 20 years working as

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,479
principal scientists

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
on sorghum breeding and genetic

77
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,079
resources um

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,440
so evan sort of they've both been

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,560
wisconsin germany um

80
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,439
india west africa of course ever got her

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
started

82
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,239
um in hohnheim with her degrees

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
but she actually did her did her high

84
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,719
school years in beirut lebanon which i

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,199
had not been

86
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,519
aware of so and she also had us

87
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,639
with the technical university of munich

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
in the 80s

89
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,119
which was in collaboration with icarda

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,719
one of the other uh

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,039
area international centers i've also

92
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,479
played key roles in the drylands

93
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,519
collaborative research

94
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,840
program of the cg of recent years

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
and they both bring i think for this

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
seminar i'm really pleased that it's two

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
aspects that i hope will interest

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
everybody a lot which is uh well

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
reading for the dryland cereals and with

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,799
climate issues and stresses

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,158
ramping up i think there are insights on

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,760
breeding for difficult

103
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,359
and heterogeneous environments will be

104
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,679
very important

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
in addition the idea of participatory

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,879
research engaging

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
farmers themselves in the research

108
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,399
process sometimes at impressive scales

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,560
and then thirdly but i'm sure not lastly

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
the idea of how to work with farmers on

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,759
seed systems getting the

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,438
the products of the breeding process

113
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,359
into the hands of more farmers

114
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,680
um in a way that is fully respects their

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
roles as decision makers and and and

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,719
actors in that process so

117
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,120
i think these are some of these things

118
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,840
are areas where we we as a department

119
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
or sorry now a section don't have as

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,238
much

121
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,839
formal training for our students and so

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,719
i'm just really appreciative i really

123
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,918
appreciate fred

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
you're sharing your insights and

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,758
experience with us i know there's a lot

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,279
of demand around agricultural

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,040
thinking and reading not just from the

128
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,559
students also from the whole whole

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,639
faculty as well

130
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
um not for this participatory and

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
stress-related reading so

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,439
um over to you fred with tremendous

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,199
thanks and best wishes

134
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,199
to eva so i'm just feeling yes

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,759
thank you very much rebecca and

136
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:49,439
we'll just start right in with

137
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:53,120
our talk which really was

138
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:56,800
representing trying to distill our

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,560
experiences and contributions from so

140
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,439
many partners

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,399
throughout the years regarding sorghum

142
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:08,079
improvement in west africa

143
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,560
and first just a few pictures just to

144
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,839
get

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,199
an impression of sorghum here in

146
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,560
mali in the field harvesting

147
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,840
uh the braided bundles of

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,560
panicles of selected

149
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,959
panicles that farmers are going to be

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,319
keeping

151
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,969
[Music]

152
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,519
for using as seed and

153
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,639
[Music]

154
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,439
where sorghum is grown across west and

155
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,439
central africa

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,919
across a wide band as you can see

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,520
stretching from

158
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,519
senegal and the far west across to sudan

159
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,759
and conforming to

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,800
the rainfall iso heights that are

161
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,639
actually very narrow bands stretching

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,319
east to west and sorghum

163
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,519
being a staple crop

164
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,960
in a very broad area

165
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:14,000
involving many if you will different

166
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,599
uh agro ecosystems ranging from about

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
100

168
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,560
days of growing period to 200 days

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,079
of growing period based on the lengths

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,399
of rainfall in the

171
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,198
single rainy season per year you any

172
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,198
modal rainfall

173
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,839
another aspect of

174
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
importance for sorghum production in

175
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,159
west africa is

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,519
that the soils are very old highly

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,560
weathered

178
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,240
and available plant available phosphorus

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,160
is very low

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,560
as you can see here where

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
the level for sufficiency threshold is

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,478
about

183
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,519
10 parts per million and

184
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,279
you can see how much of west africa is

185
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,758
colored yellow which is five

186
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:09,598
or less parts per million

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,840
and that translates

188
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:17,439
here into experiences for

189
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,638
many people individuals here we have

190
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,360
a sample of 90 farmers fields

191
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,000
who were participating in sorghum

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,199
variety testing

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,478
men and women equal numbers

194
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,080
and you can see the majority of both are

195
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:39,279
below that sufficiency threshold

196
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:44,000
but particularly women which

197
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:47,519
actually would be expected

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,720
when their system of

199
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,758
rotation is understood and that

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
typically women

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,439
are assigned the fields

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,079
for their use when the fertility has

203
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,598
dropped

204
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,318
so low that the men who are responsible

205
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:08,000
for producing the staple cereals like

206
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:12,879
sorghum pearl millet corn

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
it's no longer uh productive

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,199
and the women who very often are growing

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,079
uh peanuts for the sauce then

210
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,639
are having the lowest fertility

211
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,639
available

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,199
so with this short background for

213
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,038
sorghum

214
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:37,038
production in west africa we

215
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:40,240
in the big sense uh

216
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,199
both even myself as breeders with

217
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,000
ecosatch

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
in an international ag research center

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,759
as well as the national

220
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,519
program breeders are faced with several

221
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,720
dilemmas

222
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,080
for improving sorghum the first is what

223
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,160
germplasm-based to use for breeding

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
and then how to design an effective

225
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,039
selection strategy

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,799
that meets the diversity complexity of

227
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,519
the conditions

228
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,719
how to get seed of those new varieties

229
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,320
of farmers

230
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,440
and what does it mean to breed

231
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,640
for achieving development goals

232
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
these dilemmas will provide the

233
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,319
structure

234
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,640
for what i will share and

235
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,720
hopefully we can discuss about later

236
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:35,199
first of all the germplasm base sorghum

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,639
can be classified into five major races

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,759
based on the grain shape

239
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:47,278
and the gloom uh

240
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:50,720
shape morphological characteristics

241
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,838
which interestingly enough match

242
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,360
very closely with what is found when

243
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,320
doing

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
molecular marker diversity studies

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,680
genetic studies

246
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:07,599
and this is a very beautiful study

247
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:10,799
which cornell has been a big part of

248
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,159
for sorghum uh with

249
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,399
analysis using g was

250
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,399
of

251
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,120
nearly a thousand sorghum accessions

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,240
these are

253
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,360
germplasm gene bank accessions

254
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:33,440
and with this we can see how

255
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,600
those major races really divide up

256
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
from the map of africa and the

257
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
distribution of those races we can see

258
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,439
that

259
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,599
the quad datum race in blue

260
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
is really important in eastern and

261
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,759
southern africa

262
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,278
and that is the race that has been used

263
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,879
most widely in

264
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:56,399
international breeding worldwide

265
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,439
from india to the us australia

266
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,440
the guinea race the tan color

267
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,040
is actually distributed worldwide

268
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,640
and is one of the most it is actually

269
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:14,078
based on molecular studies

270
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:18,000
the most diverse of the races

271
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:21,919
uh west africa uh

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,240
has predominantly and almost only

273
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,679
uh the guinea race with a little bit of

274
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,519
dura actually in

275
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,359
the drier sahel region

276
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,078
it's also interesting while we're on

277
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,680
this just to note how

278
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,159
for the sorghums in far west africa that

279
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,439
would be

280
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,600
from senegal through mali to burkina

281
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,920
faso

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,920
separate from those

283
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,879
i'm sorry i did it's actually far west

284
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,800
would be those and

285
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:59,439
separate from those of the more humid

286
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,639
areas nigeria and cameroon

287
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,639
and that actually has we think

288
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,440
uh gives some useful insights for hybrid

289
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
breeding

290
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
but we can maybe touch on that later

291
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,838
so the germplasm options for breeding

292
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,600
sorghum basically are

293
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,160
two one is to use a land race germplasm

294
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
which is widely grown by farmers is

295
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,240
considered

296
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,240
to be rustic meaning

297
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,360
low yield grain yield

298
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
but very resilient

299
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:41,519
very tall average three meters

300
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,600
four meters we had trials uh even

301
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
five meter height average

302
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:53,039
uh photoperiod sensitive uh

303
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,078
but there's been very little formal

304
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,639
breeding

305
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,799
done in this race unless no elite

306
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
materials are available

307
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,399
the second option would be to use the

308
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,278
improved germplasm developed through

309
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,600
international breeding efforts

310
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:14,399
which is short height and

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,079
almost uh entirely insensitive to photo

312
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,240
period

313
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,679
and is predominantly caudate and based

314
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,159
and the photos

315
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,039
that upper two are of uh guinea

316
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,719
pinnacles

317
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:30,480
as you can see uh very different from

318
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,000
here from mali uh caudata material

319
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,639
more compact medical and if you can see

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
within a sufficient resolution of the

321
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,959
photos

322
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,320
here considerable grain mold is also

323
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:47,838
because of the compact pentacles

324
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,000
feeding of head bugs

325
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,560
with nice protection in those compact

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,559
pentacles

327
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,278
so uh so there are many traits

328
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,879
that need to be considered for certain

329
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,000
breeding

330
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,559
uh fortunately

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,440
if you will most of them only need to

332
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,359
meet a certain

333
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,360
threshold for acceptability we don't

334
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,959
have to improve all of them but

335
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,240
they have to be there but

336
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,719
grain yield really is imperative

337
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,079
it is one that needs improvement it's

338
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
identified by farmers

339
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:29,599
as being a top priority

340
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:33,278
stover quality is another trait that

341
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,120
really represents tremendous opportunity

342
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:40,720
as the local land race sorghums tall

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,000
extremely sturdy

344
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,639
woody and non-digestible for livestock

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,679
and with a crop livestock integration a

346
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,039
real opportunity

347
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,039
for improving stover quality

348
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,078
if we look at the two options that we

349
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,480
have laid out the

350
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,359
land race material basically guinea and

351
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
the improved

352
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,480
claudia materials we can see that for

353
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,719
most of those traits required for

354
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,959
adaptation for quality

355
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,920
they are present in the germ the

356
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:13,119
landry's germplasm which is

357
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,919
well material it evolved and was

358
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,879
selected

359
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,319
in that environment as compared to the

360
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:23,360
improved quad and materials

361
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,040
with the exception importantly of for

362
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,320
example stover quality

363
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:31,439
and specific resistances

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,560
so in short we

365
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,920
as a group have targeted uh work using

366
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,198
the guinea race

367
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,319
as a germplasm base with its very hard

368
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,319
grain

369
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
which is resistant to decortication

370
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,519
losses

371
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,720
which we'll come to later and

372
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,320
the blacks

373
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,959
loose panicle which has adaptation

374
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,879
advantages for adaptation and the photo

375
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,879
period sensitivity which is important

376
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,078
for

377
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,879
uh plasticity of matching the growth

378
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,000
duration

379
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,600
of the stone crop to the

380
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,440
available moisture and

381
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,600
achieving basically a the same

382
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,440
flowering maturity date irrespective of

383
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,320
whether it's sewn

384
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,639
in mid-june or end of july

385
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
and adaptation to various factors soil

386
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,039
fertility

387
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,919
uh excess of water as well as

388
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,919
insufficient water

389
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,198
with uh germplasm

390
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,720
of uh land race and improved land race

391
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,758
materials

392
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,440
we and predecessors have created

393
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,639
renomating populations uh

394
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,040
tall guinea land race from that uh

395
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,399
drive the dwarf guinea land race guinea

396
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,240
population also

397
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,720
uh one for low p adaptation

398
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,078
and also uh more narrow-based

399
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
populations with

400
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,918
back crossing diverse donors of

401
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,439
different

402
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,600
races including the guinea

403
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,919
to a guinea parent and then back

404
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,958
crossing once to the guinea

405
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,079
parent and from these different

406
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,798
populations we have

407
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,678
been able to obtain useful diversity for

408
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,798
example

409
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,600
with dwarf height which did not exist

410
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,160
prior in the land race materials was

411
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,480
combined

412
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,600
with stover quality

413
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,240
and these populations are

414
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,879
ideal for sharing with others with other

415
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,079
breeders

416
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,720
with also with farmers

417
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:54,720
who can select according to their

418
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,720
priorities and conditions

419
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,879
the second issue question is how to

420
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,120
design an effective selection strategy

421
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,120
with

422
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,720
increasing grain yield being a top

423
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,160
priority

424
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,038
but generally

425
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,600
there is i can say at most a single

426
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,519
research station per

427
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,678
agroecological zone

428
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,440
and the unstationed experiment station

429
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,160
conditions

430
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,840
are very different and poorly represent

431
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,400
the target conditions in the farmers

432
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:32,159
fields

433
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,679
which are also very diverse

434
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,160
with a broad complexity of

435
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,200
environmental factors and as we have

436
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
seen many traits

437
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,558
of importance for acceptance and

438
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,679
adaptation

439
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:52,000
and the difficulty for individuals

440
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:55,120
to be able to discriminate among

441
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,319
progenies or varieties for

442
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,519
really important traits like yield

443
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,960
food yield and for farmers for traits

444
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,639
requiring

445
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,679
more managed conditions for example

446
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,679
straggler resistance

447
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,798
and our

448
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,839
results from trying to address those

449
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,038
issues

450
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:28,079
through collaboration between breeders

451
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:31,119
and farmers we begin

452
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,759
here with a study on early generation

453
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,479
yield evaluation a real question as

454
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,160
we've

455
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,839
just mentioned with on station and on

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,360
firm conditions being so different and

457
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:48,639
wanting to maximize genetic gain for

458
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,839
farmer conditions so with 150 early

459
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,720
generation progenies

460
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:58,798
tested and selected both on farm

461
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,519
with subsets of 50 progenies per farmer

462
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,480
and on station with the whole set

463
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,759
together

464
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,038
in a three replicate alpha lattice

465
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,679
design

466
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,400
in two fields one with low phos plant

467
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,400
available phosphorus and one with high

468
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,559
and 12 progeny selected from each

469
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,759
with actually it turns out three being

470
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,759
in common

471
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,960
between those and those were tested over

472
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,000
two years

473
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,600
in farmer's fields and here we have the

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,558
yield of those progenies

475
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,240
platted against the trial means and

476
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,200
what's interesting is we have in black

477
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240
the czechs

478
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,159
land race varieties and all of the

479
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400
others are selected

480
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,760
we can see some progress over the land

481
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,159
race checks

482
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,759
the selections from on farm and on

483
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,080
station are

484
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,798
actually overlapping but the three that

485
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,558
were

486
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,918
selected from both on-farm and on

487
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,879
station

488
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:59,919
were very high so three cheers for

489
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:05,039
combining results

490
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:08,000
at the involvement of the breeders with

491
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,919
farmers in conducting on-farm

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,200
participatory variety trials

493
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,440
for yield became a major aspect of the

494
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,640
breeding programs

495
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:23,200
in mali and in the region

496
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:26,240
in these trials

497
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,000
we're testing 30 to 40

498
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,759
progenies varieties both on station as

499
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,200
well as on farm

500
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:38,558
and here this table

501
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,319
it shows the results

502
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:44,960
prepared with the names of the varieties

503
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,158
each column is a different farmer with

504
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,840
the yield given

505
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:54,080
in 100 kilo sacs a unit they can

506
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:58,879
identify with with in the local language

507
00:21:54,079 --> 00:22:03,119
the mean yield and the repeatability

508
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,720
and color coded for above

509
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:11,279
the mean based on standard deviation

510
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,279
centered here mean and below

511
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,879
and the farmers would study these and

512
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
use these as well as of course the

513
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,600
breeders using this data

514
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,798
for making decisions on what to retain

515
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,359
what to

516
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,798
focus on for for example seed production

517
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,479
in the

518
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:33,759
following years etc here

519
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,200
trial results from those yield results

520
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,079
from those trials

521
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
here we have

522
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,439
in blue and red the local variety here

523
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,960
blue

524
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,960
the local variety and we see here

525
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:54,239
a very promising progeny that

526
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:57,678
shows superior yield across

527
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,798
the productivity range

528
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,798
to the local varieties

529
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,720
this was an open pollinated variety

530
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,000
and here we have two hybrids or actually

531
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,798
three hybrids and the locals and we can

532
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,159
see here

533
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,720
uh again with these trials we can

534
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,640
really see the performance across

535
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,640
productivity conditions which is a whole

536
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,640
mix of factors

537
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,119
with the open pollinated varieties we

538
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,798
had managed to make 10 15 percent gain

539
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:35,279
with the hybrids

540
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:38,319
we had 30 percent yield to priorities

541
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,759
uh the post-harvest

542
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:45,678
quality testing also became a

543
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:49,278
important part of the testing

544
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,278
series conducted

545
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:57,038
both for uh

546
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,919
taste consistency

547
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,038
quality of the food with taste testing

548
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,840
but also in the

549
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,839
preparation and processing of the grain

550
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,158
so the actions that

551
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:21,119
as a group were being taken were

552
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:25,439
testing and selecting in the target zone

553
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:28,959
thanks to many farmers at collaboration

554
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,080
testing in multiple environments

555
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,038
and under a range of conditions both

556
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,519
fertility and on station

557
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,079
with managed low phosphorus as well as

558
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,119
the

559
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:45,038
routine recommended

560
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:48,079
if you will uh fertility management

561
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:51,278
and linking breeding and crop management

562
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:57,119
and food preparation in

563
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:57,119
the mix of the breeding decision making

564
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:08,000
and farmers were

565
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,000
involved integrated into the

566
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,200
different stages of the breeding cycle

567
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:17,919
through these

568
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:21,360
trials through discussions

569
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,159
during the trials in the annual feedback

570
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,038
meetings

571
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,200
and planning meetings etc for setting

572
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,599
priorities

573
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,080
for generating diversity particularly

574
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,599
the random eating populations

575
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:38,000
uh in selections farmers

576
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,678
and breeders love to select but

577
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,880
especially farmers love to select

578
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,120
individual

579
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:49,120
plants spentacles to the evaluation and

580
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:52,558
to bridal release and dissemination

581
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:56,479
which we'll be talking about later

582
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:59,359
so there were really

583
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,120
a network of farmers and breeders

584
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,939
established variety testing

585
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,639
and selection

586
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,000
[Music]

587
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,480
which is presented here in this

588
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,159
map here with the experiment stations of

589
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,440
ecosatch and two of the national

590
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,120
program sorghum breeding program and the

591
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,000
farmer cooperatives

592
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,000
or unions of cooperatives that were

593
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,440
collaborating with the breeders

594
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,679
across southern valley

595
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,080
with a back drop of the rainfall iso

596
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
heights

597
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:43,439
uh the third question how to get seed of

598
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,359
these new varieties that are being bred

599
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,600
to the farmers

600
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,759
let's take an overview a snapshot from

601
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,839
the year 2000 where the national seed

602
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,839
service was largely dysfunctional

603
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,519
with the structural adjustments being in

604
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,839
full swing

605
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,000
and the extension services shrinking or

606
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,519
disappearing completely

607
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,919
there were no private sector seed

608
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,960
companies present

609
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,038
and farmers did not

610
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,360
purchase seed it was basically an

611
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,839
unknown

612
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,839
behavior

613
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
fortunately at that time variety

614
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,720
registration

615
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,398
in the national variety catalog was very

616
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,519
easy

617
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:35,119
uh the breeders could just develop a

618
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:38,798
description fish technique and it

619
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,759
sent it to the responsible person for

620
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:44,079
inclusion

621
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:48,398
as the breeder was responsible for

622
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:50,639
choosing and maintaining the seed

623
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,519
and seeded certification was possible

624
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,520
but expensive

625
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,720
steps that were taken in this

626
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,439
background for getting seed to

627
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,839
farmers of these new varieties there

628
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,360
were

629
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:14,319
detailed studies of the farmers

630
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:17,359
seed management system conducted

631
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:20,000
a farm organizations farmer clubs

632
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,000
that were involved they're interested in

633
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,798
grain marketing were identified

634
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,839
as uh likely having interest and demand

635
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,839
for new varieties

636
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,038
and collaborating farmers in the variety

637
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:40,158
testing activities

638
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:43,599
on their own decided to initiate

639
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,799
large-scale seed production

640
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:49,759
and through these various activities

641
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,759
there was joint learning by the farmer

642
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,440
organizations

643
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:58,960
and the various partners including ngos

644
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,640
radio breeders

645
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,640
and disseminating seed

646
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,558
we'll start with some results here from

647
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,038
a

648
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,839
study of the farmer seed system in one

649
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,398
village in mali

650
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,519
which uh it was found that there were 12

651
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:17,278
varieties

652
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,759
being grown in that village with one to

653
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:24,240
five varieties being grown

654
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:27,839
by each of the large extended families

655
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,519
corresponding to the different uses and

656
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:34,639
adaptation specificities of those

657
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:39,119
uh varieties and the conditions for the

658
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,240
available to the farmers uh

659
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:45,119
the source of those varieties were from

660
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,319
basically from the village or from the

661
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,639
family

662
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,639
and from the farmer's own production

663
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,759
we had several surprises one was that

664
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,079
although there were many varieties being

665
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,440
grown there are only one or

666
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,839
two varieties that were really

667
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,038
predominant that were covering about 80

668
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:10,959
of the area the major

669
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:13,599
varieties and that those varieties

670
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,240
were changing they were the ones that

671
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,918
were currently

672
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,240
predominant were very new they were less

673
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,759
than 10 years old

674
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,120
and these new and new varieties actually

675
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,119
rarely came from

676
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,558
formal sources from breed breeding

677
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,559
programs

678
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,278
also there was learning of

679
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,359
the social expectations and thinking

680
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,798
about

681
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,918
seed in obtaining seed in acceptable

682
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,519
ways

683
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:51,120
for example that a good farmer produces

684
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:55,278
his or her own seed that

685
00:30:51,119 --> 00:31:00,158
taking seed from outside

686
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:06,720
at the time of sowing is not okay

687
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:10,480
but it really is a prestige

688
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,679
to be asked by someone to give them seed

689
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,240
but

690
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,240
taking money for that seed is not okay

691
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:22,959
and that the farmers

692
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,640
almost universally welcomed testing of

693
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,278
new varieties we're excited

694
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,759
and when i asked would you like small

695
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:33,200
trials looking at three to f

696
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,278
or five fridays or big trials generally

697
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
people always wanted the more we can see

698
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:37,839
the better

699
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:46,079
so through many years of

700
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,640
learning by doing basically and

701
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,960
discussing

702
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,080
uh we learned several things one that

703
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,159
the unfarm variety trials

704
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,199
actually didn't assure large-scale

705
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,120
awareness

706
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,480
or dissemination of new varieties one

707
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,518
thing we were

708
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,480
thinking might be piggybacked on the

709
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,558
testing program

710
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,839
however the farmers

711
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,200
interest and demand for receiving trial

712
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:19,038
sets

713
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,600
uh especially of the not the first stage

714
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,839
testing but the second stage farmer

715
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,558
entirely farmer managed only three to

716
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:29,199
five varieties

717
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,639
far outstripped the breeders capacity to

718
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,000
provide

719
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,038
uh with requests going up to 200

720
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,038
300 400

721
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,839
that the collaborating farmers

722
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,600
as i mentioned farmers

723
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:52,079
who were involved in the variety testing

724
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,719
on their own decided to start producing

725
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,038
seed

726
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,399
of those varieties as a really conscious

727
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:03,599
decision to address the issue of

728
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:07,599
disseminating seed of

729
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,599
the newly developed varieties

730
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,000
and the seed certified seed that they

731
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,759
were being

732
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,558
and they were producing was

733
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:23,599
increasing yearly actually doubling

734
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,599
from year to year with the

735
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:30,158
pharmaceutical selling to

736
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:33,759
emerging seed companies uh

737
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:39,360
however after many years of this

738
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:43,278
uh growth in seed production

739
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:47,439
there still was basically no noticeable

740
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:51,200
seed being grown coming through that

741
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,600
pathway by the neighbors of those

742
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,679
pharmacy cooperatives in the areas where

743
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,480
those pharmaceuticals

744
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,159
were located which led to discussions

745
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,720
among the farmers

746
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,200
and with the breeders which led to

747
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,800
exploring different options for example

748
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,800
that of selling mini packs test packets

749
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:20,078
here just to

750
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,320
give a picture of the number of

751
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,879
certain varieties that these pharmacy

752
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,879
cooperatives

753
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:32,000
have produced during a four-year period

754
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,959
uh with uh i would like to highlight

755
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,119
it was the farmers themselves and their

756
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,000
organizations who decided

757
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,280
which varieties to produce on their own

758
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,280
risk

759
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,000
there was no uh contracting or uh

760
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,639
the breeders were only there supporting

761
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
uh

762
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,079
with provision of

763
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,359
the foundation seed as well as

764
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:02,800
accompanying with various

765
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:05,519
activities so

766
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,640
across three different areas a large

767
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,960
number of

768
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,639
varieties being produced and the

769
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,599
majority

770
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,480
were the new varieties of the open

771
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,480
pollinated

772
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,880
traditional type 3 4 meter height

773
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,440
there was a few land races that were

774
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,280
continually produced

775
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,320
but the quantity was not increasing over

776
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,960
time

777
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,240
and there were few bread of this

778
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,320
traditional type

779
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,039
the majority of varieties that they were

780
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,880
producing were of new types

781
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,920
of short and dual grain plus stover

782
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,838
types

783
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,838
and of hybrids

784
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,880
here just to look at

785
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,000
the what happened the outcomes from

786
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,960
the mini packs those 100 gram

787
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,039
seed packets that were farmers seed

788
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,079
co-ops were selling

789
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,000
for very little money but offering

790
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,760
farmers a chance to look at new

791
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,800
varieties as well as

792
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,000
the first chance to actually

793
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,480
buy to pay money to receive seed for

794
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,480
variety

795
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:27,519
and it was successful in terms of

796
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,560
farmers saving seed and even a

797
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,320
significant considerable number sharing

798
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,279
seed with others this is both for

799
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,720
sorghum and millet mali and

800
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,640
burkina faso and niger

801
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,118
so now we can come back to the question

802
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,639
can

803
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,920
sorghum seed be sold to farmers

804
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:54,400
and see can be sold

805
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,760
if uh it's for testing

806
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,000
in the local uh culture and

807
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,000
if

808
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:07,519
it benefits a group so individuals no

809
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,519
no go but for a farmer clock or vs

810
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,719
the mini packs were great for marketing

811
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,480
but did not generate

812
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:17,679
income uh sufficiently

813
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,039
but over the years the demand for larger

814
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:24,319
seat side of packages increased

815
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:27,679
uh to see co-ops currently are still

816
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,200
selling mostly to both buyers

817
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:34,559
but the market is unpredictable uh

818
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,919
at the whim of ngos government

819
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,480
programs on very short notice but the

820
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,599
farmers

821
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,039
are selling seed directly to the seed

822
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,559
co-ops are selling

823
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:50,400
directly to farmers which they realize

824
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:54,639
is a more sustainable option

825
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,280
many options many advantages of farmers

826
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,279
as the managers of seed businesses the

827
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,160
trust and accountability and the quality

828
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
and adaptation

829
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,039
so building on farmers expertise and

830
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,838
capacities

831
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,838
it's generating income where it's needed

832
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:15,759
in the rural areas

833
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:19,199
and the pharmacy co-ops can partner with

834
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,320
breeders for continuing to develop new

835
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,039
varieties

836
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,720
feeding the pipeline and making the seed

837
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:29,119
system sustainable

838
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:32,000
and with other belly chain actors

839
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,599
and the last point is breeding for

840
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,920
sustainable development goals

841
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,640
with the example of sorghum improvement

842
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,320
for micronutrient

843
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:46,639
nutrition in mali and the first

844
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,920
step is to understand the context and

845
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,440
here

846
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,639
very briefly a consumption study which

847
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,880
showed that

848
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:58,639
all types of nutrition aspects are

849
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,559
deficient but

850
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:05,679
iron across the board total

851
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:08,719
looking at feasibility for improving

852
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,960
ninja strata nutritional status via bio

853
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,480
fortification

854
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,599
in brief

855
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,960
sorghum is important especially

856
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,160
so children's diets are so limited

857
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,720
so based on uh staple cereal sorghum

858
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:32,480
millet maize but

859
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:35,838
to increase the iron content

860
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,960
in the flower to make a meaningful

861
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,000
difference in nutrition

862
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,838
requires a dramatic increase

863
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,760
in the concentration iron concentration

864
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:50,000
good news there is genetic variability

865
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,920
relatively low genotype by phosphorus or

866
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,559
environment interactions

867
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,240
high heritability so breeding can

868
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:02,320
contribute but only

869
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:02,319
as one component it's not enough alone

870
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,000
looking at the use of sorghum

871
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:14,000
by women grown by

872
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,318
women what's interesting to find that

873
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,679
thanks to a social science student

874
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:24,800
uh if a fandom

875
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:27,118
that this sorghum that women grew

876
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,119
was

877
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,719
frequently used to prepare a special

878
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,400
meal for the children

879
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,078
when they were hungry when there was no

880
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,160
leftovers available

881
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,599
which would never come from the men's

882
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,199
granary because that

883
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,720
food is for the family for the main

884
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,318
meals

885
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:50,159
so a pathway for child nutrition

886
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:54,318
and uh bio fortification through women

887
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:57,358
in women's sorghum cultivation

888
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:59,039
looking at processing and preparation of

889
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,880
the grain

890
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:05,440
here we have a whole grain in green and

891
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,160
manually decorticated the traditional

892
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,240
way

893
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,639
modern festival producing flower

894
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:14,000
removing the

895
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:17,838
seed coat to produce flour

896
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,920
and with that decortication

897
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,679
there's the loss of 50 percent of the

898
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,800
iron

899
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,078
also the phytate as well as zinc the

900
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,599
phytate content

901
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,390
is reduced proportionally meaning

902
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,599
there's no improvement or

903
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:33,440
[Music]

904
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,359
no change in the bioavailability of the

905
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,280
iron or zinc is simply

906
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:44,078
reduced through decortication

907
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:47,760
and the breeder is then incorporated

908
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,560
more systematically and actually

909
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,240
giving more attention to that trait

910
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,599
decortication rate

911
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,639
decortication losses here from the

912
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,119
farmer

913
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,078
on farm participatory variety trials

914
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,358
different varieties

915
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,480
the percent of

916
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,159
grain lost during decortication

917
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,880
of the different varieties ranging from

918
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,679
10 to 30 percent

919
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,559
l mark's land race varieties you can see

920
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,279
that

921
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,440
we have mix of improved and land race

922
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,880
varieties

923
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,039
and that there's a big difference

924
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,079
a much more difference than

925
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:33,358
the content of iron and zinc per se

926
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,400
in the grain and uh

927
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:39,759
here from unfarmed trials with

928
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,119
uh two hybrids uh fada

929
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,400
and uh sorry one hybrid fida

930
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,838
an nopv latta and the local variety

931
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,400
tablet

932
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,480
very similar iron concentrations in the

933
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,680
grain across

934
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,280
environments and one hybrid that was

935
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:02,799
very poor sewer with the very low

936
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,599
decoration yield in low iron

937
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,640
content so the changes made in the

938
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,079
breeding program

939
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:12,879
were to observe brain quality monitoring

940
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,640
iron and zinc concentrations

941
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,280
and really critically making sure that

942
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,279
new fridays

943
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,838
show it advantages when grown in

944
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,598
women's fields that means under low

945
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,920
phosphorus conditions

946
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,760
also typically in intercropping

947
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,358
conditions for example with ground nuts

948
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,880
the collaboration with the

949
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:44,078
breeders with food technologists

950
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,880
nutritionist to identify options

951
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,920
for improving nutrition including and

952
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,559
beyond

953
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,559
simply genetic

954
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:57,199
biofortification and

955
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:00,078
[Music]

956
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,879
delivering developing collaboration also

957
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,079
for

958
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,119
education it was amazing simply

959
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,240
in the trials talking about

960
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,358
nutrition about micronutrients was a new

961
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,479
concept

962
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,199
led to changes and differences in

963
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,880
behavior

964
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,279
on the part of farmers as well as

965
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,280
breeders

966
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,160
so in conclusion uh effective reading in

967
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,160
the center

968
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:31,759
of sorghum domestication

969
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:35,358
uh setting priorities in

970
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,839
building clarity of

971
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,480
what is targeted the product profiles if

972
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,880
you will

973
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:46,480
the selection strategies uh required

974
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,200
farmers participation with breeders

975
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,400
and interdisciplinary collaboration with

976
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,118
social scientists

977
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,800
gender specialists nutritionists

978
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,440
physiologists contributed

979
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:03,119
uh and agronomists

980
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:07,280
and that large yield

981
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:10,960
improvements are needed ten percent

982
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,160
uh gains uh with the complexity of

983
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,599
environments

984
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,838
and factors is cannot be noticed by

985
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,838
farmers it cannot

986
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:22,880
generate

987
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:26,400
any momentum if you will

988
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,599
but 20 30 is needed to really

989
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,079
make a difference but

990
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,920
those yield improvements must be made

991
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,839
with the appropriate

992
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,159
array of adaptation and quality

993
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:41,599
characteristics

994
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,879
and that farmer raider collaborative

995
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,200
networks

996
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,358
really have so much to offer in

997
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,799
supporting bridal diversity

998
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,639
ensuring experiences and resources

999
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,359
that the farmers and breeders bringing

1000
00:45:52,639 --> 00:46:01,358
together can create synergies

1001
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:04,480
of the information flow and feedback

1002
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,159
that also gender considerations and

1003
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,440
gender inclusion is essential for

1004
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,639
achieving benefits

1005
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,679
for the whole family and community even

1006
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,838
though

1007
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,598
this is a crop that is considered to be

1008
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,039
a men's ground

1009
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,318
and finally the importance

1010
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,079
to be aware and consider it to do no

1011
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,279
harm

1012
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,640
which can be attended to through

1013
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,000
inclusion

1014
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,960
of all different people and

1015
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,679
learning together with that i'd like to

1016
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,920
thank you

1017
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:43,279
and thank the contributions of so many

1018
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,720
many people and

1019
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,680
also just to mention that there is

1020
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,679
the references in full at the end for

1021
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:55,199
anyone who is interested to look

1022
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,199
further thank you

1023
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:02,239
so thank you so much fred um

1024
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,160
that was really fantastic um i

1025
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,358
must say where we don't have a ton of

1026
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,480
time left but

1027
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:11,838
may i uh ask if anyone would like to uh

1028
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,838
bring up any questions

1029
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,959
uh i don't actually easily see the

1030
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,400
hands-raised feature here

1031
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,000
so if anybody wants to just go ahead

1032
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,039
feel free um

1033
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,960
hearing no open mics um let me let me

1034
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,119
make one comment and one question fred

1035
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,039
um i had the honor about a year ago

1036
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,720
visiting mali and seeing one of the

1037
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,400
participatory sorghum

1038
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,480
trials play out and it was just a

1039
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,280
beautiful piece of like performance art

1040
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,358
or something

1041
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,040
it was a hybrid that farmers were

1042
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,000
testing and it was it was maybe their

1043
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,759
100th

1044
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,318
event i was told where you know you had

1045
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,079
icresad and ngo people and

1046
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,239
people from the community there it's

1047
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,359
just very very impressive

1048
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,358
um how people were able to follow a

1049
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,199
nice protocol you know even using

1050
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,838
digital technologies and women were able

1051
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,439
to represent themselves very well and

1052
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,880
decisions were made both on the agronomy

1053
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,559
over the season that farmers had

1054
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,960
recorded the data and also

1055
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,160
um on the culinary test that was done on

1056
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,480
the on that day

1057
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,159
but i um so just that's just like a

1058
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,800
testimonial that was really

1059
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,639
incredible and then i i was wondering if

1060
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,079
you could comment on the issue of g by e

1061
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,318
of any sort like

1062
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,000
you know the three best varieties you

1063
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,880
mentioned came out both

1064
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,400
on farming on station which in a way

1065
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,160
isn't that consistent with me with the

1066
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,880
you know the imperative of going on farm

1067
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:33,199
to see

1068
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,039
different things so ultimately do you

1069
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,239
see what you would consider meaningful i

1070
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,639
saw some of those lines over

1071
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,838
you know crossing here and there but is

1072
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,598
there anything that you would consider

1073
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:45,279
meaningful g by e that you think

1074
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,480
you know deserves note thank you

1075
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,480
a beautiful question and

1076
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,719
and your testimonial testimonials are

1077
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,719
great

1078
00:48:53,838 --> 00:49:00,719
g by it was interesting

1079
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,639
with analysis of the unfarm trial data

1080
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:06,799
trying to tease out

1081
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,799
major factors and it was so difficult

1082
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,000
there are so many different factors and

1083
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,358
they're

1084
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,239
really interwoven what

1085
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:17,199
the conclusion is is that you really

1086
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,879
need to test

1087
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:25,279
across a wide

1088
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:28,720
range of environments rainfall alone

1089
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:32,640
onset or ending and strike a presence

1090
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:34,399
or weeding totally weed infested or not

1091
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,159
soil fertility

1092
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,760
all of them play a part but we couldn't

1093
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,118
pull anything out

1094
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:45,359
uh regarding on farm

1095
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:48,640
combining on pharma nonstation tests

1096
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:52,558
this was it's a small sample let's put

1097
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:56,838
the results in perspective but

1098
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:00,400
also the on station test was

1099
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:03,519
uh both with uh

1100
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,000
regular favorable conditions as well as

1101
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,960
under managed low phosphorus conditions

1102
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,079
which are

1103
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,358
are approaching farmers field conditions

1104
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,640
the productivity is

1105
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:18,078
50 that of under the normal if you will

1106
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,480
conditions uh it had higher correlation

1107
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,839
with

1108
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,280
unfarmed trial results higher genetic

1109
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,558
correlations

1110
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,319
uh heritability was not much worse

1111
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:34,240
and was a really valuable

1112
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:37,358
uh contribution i wouldn't say

1113
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:41,598
test on lopi feels alone

1114
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:46,558
it also was

1115
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,559
risking failures

1116
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:52,838
which we due to

1117
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,240
the low fertility susceptibility to for

1118
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:59,119
example rate infestation with

1119
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,439
sort of midge etc so really combining

1120
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:06,079
results from many different environments

1121
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:10,318
and collaboration among breeders

1122
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:13,359
among farmers uh is the way to deal with

1123
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,358
uh g by e

1124
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,760
um so we have a couple of comments in

1125
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,000
the chat and then i would

1126
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,800
unless anybody has a point to make we

1127
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,119
can

1128
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,800
turn fred over to the graduate students

1129
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,559
so kathleen hefferon

1130
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,480
has said how can the idea of gender

1131
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,440
differences in crops and farming be

1132
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,240
transmitted to westerners

1133
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,240
and then ruby followed on with a comment

1134
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,239
i second interest in that concept

1135
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,598
as new to me personally but also as a

1136
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:40,879
powerful illustration of gender

1137
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,480
differences that can contribute to

1138
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,760
better breeding for women's fields is

1139
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,199
very interesting to me

1140
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,800
and a concept i'd like to explore

1141
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,439
further thank you so a couple people

1142
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,519
with

1143
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,358
clear interest in the gender issues any

1144
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:55,280
anything you want to say on that

1145
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:57,920
topic fred yeah um

1146
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,200
actually i'm the wrong person about

1147
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,838
transmitting gender

1148
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:07,759
issues to westerners being that

1149
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:10,078
we spent most of our time in

1150
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,240
west africa and so it's from that

1151
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,000
perspective that we're seeing it

1152
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,358
and we don't have much experience trying

1153
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,358
to talk to

1154
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:21,119
westerners if you will uh

1155
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,799
you're better at west africans sorry

1156
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,838
sorry sorry let me take that back ava's

1157
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
been doing

1158
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:30,400
uh and not me

1159
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,960
i'm showing my uh my ignorance ava

1160
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,760
has been doing training programs but

1161
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,400
that's not for westerners

1162
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,160
what i was thinking is it's talking

1163
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,838
talking talking

1164
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:47,440
and learning for us

1165
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:51,519
it was we were not from the beginning

1166
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,480
engaged in any explicit gender

1167
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,679
activities

1168
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,559
we were interested but

1169
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,799
we were doing what we thought was most

1170
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,359
appropriate with the resources we had

1171
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,400
but with learning for example that a

1172
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,960
social science

1173
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,519
student insisted she wanted to study

1174
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,318
women

1175
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,838
and women's organ production and he said

1176
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,358
okay go ahead

1177
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:18,558
and from that we learned wow

1178
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,078
there really is a role and we do need to

1179
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,720
take this into consideration

1180
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,039
in our breeding program if we want to

1181
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:28,399
consider the whole system

1182
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:30,318
and it's the same

1183
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,280
way for nutrition we cannot deal with

1184
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:36,719
nutrition if we don't include women

1185
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,720
i mean that was such a

1186
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,719
big learning for us is by involving

1187
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,279
women

1188
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:45,039
yet in the culinary testing be it in the

1189
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,319
farmer participatory

1190
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:51,039
trials specifically designed for women

1191
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,239
seed production including women in the

1192
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:57,279
discussions

1193
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:59,199
it changed the discussion and brought

1194
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,280
progress that would have been missed

1195
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:05,759
otherwise

1196
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,880
okay great um so it's now 1 35 so we've

1197
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,119
gone a bit over

1198
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,000
and actually ellie has reminded me that

1199
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,318
the graduate

1200
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,280
student meeting with you fred become

1201
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:16,558
starts

1202
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,760
uh at what is for us 150

1203
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,079
so 15 minutes from now which

1204
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,960
will be later later for you but it's

1205
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,640
meant to afford you

1206
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,159
