1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,000
University.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,480
So, it's Mast's week, right? It, you

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
know, it seems like the world stops uh

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,400
for us in the golf world when this

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,839
happens. We talked about it last week.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,359
Talk about it again. And in honor of

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,600
that, we got a sports turf discussion

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,519
today. So, uh we are going to find a way

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,920
to twist this thing uh into a golf

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,679
discussion to the start, Evan. And I'm

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,600
going to ask you a couple of questions.

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,278
And I'm wondering your thoughts because

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,039
there are some things I think for golf

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,719
folks that are listening that I think

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,239
will be really fascinating because we're

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,558
starting to look at putting surfaces in

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,039
a way that you used to look at baseball

19
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,878
infields if you don't mind. Sure. Hey

20
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,238
golfers are athletes too. Yeah, that's

21
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,159
right. They are now. Uh that's for sure.

22
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,558
Uh we got this note, Carl and I got this

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,078
note from our good pal Rick Slatterie uh

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,238
who's down at the Masters. What did he

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,280
say, Carl? He walked 25 miles in two

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,439
days. Man, he's putting the steps in. is

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,960
putting the steps in and thrilled to see

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,358
a pimento cheese sandwich for $1.50. And

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,159
anybody that gets down there knows uh

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
that's exactly how this works. Carl,

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,080
come on with this guy. Tape his mouth

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,719
shut because he couldn't hold his uh

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,959
tongue. He was getting himself so upset.

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,599
I'd like to hear your thoughts on, you

35
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,599
know, taping your mouth shut. I think

36
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,079
this should be something we could use in

37
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,798
other parts of our lives as well. Why

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,239
should it be confined to this guy? Uh

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,479
what are your thoughts about the

40
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,158
mentality that drives a golfer to do

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,078
this ridiculousness? This, you know,

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,520
this speaks to my theory that golf just

43
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,359
makes people crazy and you know, they

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,840
you could see really smart people just

45
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,719
in all other walks of life and as soon

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
as you put a golf club in their hand, it

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,399
is all out the window for whatever

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,158
reason.

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,680
Well, this poor guy, I think, played a

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,560
cornfairy event uh like this uh and and

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,280
you know, was completely serious about

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
it helping his

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,040
game. A couple of guys that don't need

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
help. And of course, as an old guy

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,079
myself now, just want to raise

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,038
everybody's attention that while Ludvig

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,680
Oldborg at 20 years old or 21 years old

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:16,399
is on the leaderboard, my man Freddy

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,280
Couples is T13 and Bernard Langanger, 70

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
67 years old, will probably be the

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,680
oldest guy to make the cut. He's at even

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
par right now. So, we'll see how it goes

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,159
today and what he's able to do. But

64
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,439
we're very excited about these two old

65
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,919
guys really showing up. Okay, Evan. So,

66
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,318
we talk about firmness on putting

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,839
surfaces, right? I know you're in the

68
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,439
We're going to talk about your line of

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,560
work and that you're currently doing

70
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:47,199
with Biocore and in field uh uh safety

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,360
and measurements. Um uh we look at a

72
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,238
variety of different ways. There's a Kle

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,560
hammer uh on the right making an indent

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,080
and either a traditional true firm or

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,719
even the PGA railroad ball bearing that

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,280
they drop uh at a uniform height to

77
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:07,439
measure firmness. So this is a very

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,719
commonly uh discussed term now. It's

79
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:14,800
getting more widely known. What is not

80
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,039
as widely uh studied and known is the

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
strength of that surface. Right. And you

82
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,519
studied this a little bit with your clay

83
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,280
work years ago. So, you know, no matter

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,039
if it and of course this may be the

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,439
first masters they have that's really

86
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,000
firm and fast cuz they get rain all the

87
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,639
time and then they run those subairs and

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,759
oh, everybody's the subair thing. And

89
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,878
this still happens in the top millimeter

90
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,039
no matter how much they run that subair.

91
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,439
So, here you are uh back in your

92
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,759
Pittsburgh pirate days as a working man.

93
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,878
Now you're now you're a senior engineer

94
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,959
with Biocore. Um and when we had you on

95
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,959
years ago, uh you know, when you were

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,598
doing your infield work, we were talking

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,920
about cleat in cleat out and how the

98
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,639
ball was responding to these clay

99
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,559
surfaces. So, my question to start this

100
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
out before I get to the weather and we

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,799
get to the meat of the sports

102
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,119
conversation today is what are your

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,480
thoughts about ways of potentially

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,120
measuring this or understanding it a

105
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:19,199
little bit better on a putting surface?

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,040
Well, I feel uh only a little ambushed

107
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,240
by this question. So, um, I think real

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
quick just from an engineering

109
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
standpoint, there's there's all

110
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,039
different kinds of gobbleygook terms

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,439
that that people use to describe

112
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,439
materials. Young's modulus, elastic

113
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,120
modulus, sheer modulus, and all these

114
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,959
terms describe the way that a material

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,519
deforms in different directions under

116
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,198
different means of loads, right? So,

117
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,839
firmness is typically thought about in

118
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,160
the vertical direction or normal um

119
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,198
forces. Whereas a shearing strength, I

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
think that's pretty intuitive. I think

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
most people understand sheer strength to

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,400
be in sort of a a perpendicular or

123
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:58,079
co-planer direction to the surface,

124
00:04:53,399 --> 00:05:00,319
right? So in uh in sand root zones,

125
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,079
we're really relying mostly on the

126
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,680
anchoring of the grass plants to provide

127
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,399
the stability. My old adviser Andy

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,038
McNet, he would say, you know, we've

129
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,359
tried in the past to to stabilize sand

130
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,639
root zones by changing the particle size

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
distribution and with this sort of the

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,918
CU concept that's really caught on in

133
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,120
the golf course world for firmness.

134
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,319
Well, if you do this sort of thought

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
experiment when you have an athlete

136
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,159
running around on the surface with no

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,240
grass, if you had this high uh high CU

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,439
sand that's very non-uniform and ideally

139
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
you could have some of the particle

140
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,560
packing working to to fill that in. Do

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
you really think that's going to

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,439
stabilize the surface or I mean the

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
reality is those athletes are going to

144
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,120
still blow that sand all over the place,

145
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,038
right? So, you're really relying on the

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
network of roots and ryomes in the case

147
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,199
of a you know Kentucky bluegrass sports

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
field or a Bermuda grass field on a golf

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,520
course. you know, if it's a a bent grass

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
or even a bent poa surface, you're

151
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,560
relying more on the stoleniferous growth

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,000
habit, which is contributing to this

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,038
organic matter on the top. So that I

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
guess that's kind of a starting point

155
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,800
for the conversation. We're really, I

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
think, in this case, concerned a little

157
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
bit more with the organic materials,

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
whether they're living or dead, and then

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,319
certainly the degree of decomposition on

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
the top. See, this is so great. I am you

161
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
and you give me an answer like that. I

162
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,680
got to do this more often to to people.

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,519
That was absolutely brilliant. And I

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,840
think you're right. what we're trying

165
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,478
there's two parts to this. One is how do

166
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,399
we measure it right to simulate a ball.

167
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,800
There's a lot of discrepancies even in

168
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,638
dropping a thing down on the surface to

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,960
determine it you know is it correlated

170
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,759
to moisture is it correlated to organic

171
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,478
matter. Now you know we have this the uh

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,240
uh USGA method of organic matter testing

173
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,240
the uh OM246 where you know yeah you're

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,079
honing in on the 2 millimeters. So I

175
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,079
think you know this is there's no

176
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,478
answer. This is what's great about this.

177
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,959
This is the beginning of the thinking of

178
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,439
how we have to measure this because

179
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,918
firmness is only part of the equation,

180
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,560
right? You can get it firm, but when you

181
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,879
get those forces from other directions,

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,280
especially when you consider the spin

183
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,519
rate, uh if they're hitting a uh you

184
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,638
know a close iron that they can use the

185
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,079
grooves and get the spin on the ball, uh

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
it really adds uh quite a bit of

187
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,519
complexity. And then at the end of the

188
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,598
day, what does a s golf course

189
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,439
superintendent do? Should we verticut

190
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:19,759
and put more sand in here? Do we need to

191
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,839
airify? Uh is it is it a brush? Does

192
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,120
brushing help? You know, I don't think

193
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,519
we understand really what it takes to

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
manage that upper millimeter, right,

195
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,318
Evan? Where this reaction is occurring,

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,080
right? It's not a deep thing. When the

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,080
ball hits it, we're only talking about a

198
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,639
millimeter or two, right? different than

199
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,120
your sports field where the cleat is

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
entering into the substrate a little

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
bit. Yes. Yeah, I totally agree. The the

202
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
surface surface really is what you're

203
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,280
managing. Um, you know, honestly, it's

204
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,879
similar to a infield skin. You're really

205
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,399
managing that top, you know, maybe inch

206
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,680
or usually less than that, just where

207
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,120
the cleats are interacting and in this

208
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
case where the ball's interacting. I

209
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
think one thing that sticks out to me on

210
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,280
this picture, you can see um obviously

211
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,519
the living plant material on top, but

212
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,679
this sort of turf slime or or

213
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,680
relatively, you know, degraded organic

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,598
or intermediate degraded organic matter

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
anyway, which has very little shear

216
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,199
strength and probably whose physical

217
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,918
properties is highly dependent on the

218
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,680
water content. Um that type of material

219
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,000
has a very high water holding capacity

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,478
due to its you sort of I guess molecular

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,918
structure and sort of random randomly

222
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,240
oriented um organic molecules. But also

223
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,519
uh

224
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,960
um will depend highly on the water

225
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,158
content, right? So when it's dry, it's

226
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,519
pretty stiff. It's it's probably

227
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,679
compressed a little bit. When it starts

228
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,599
to absorb water, it's going to swell.

229
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,679
And even if there is some sand in that

230
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
top layer, some grit, that swelling

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,278
could potentially open up that, you

232
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
know, that medium so that the sand

233
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,600
grains are no longer in such intimate

234
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,199
contact. This is so great. All right.

235
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,879
Okay. Let's get to the weather and then

236
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,320
we're going to get to the meat of the

237
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,838
discussion. Um it's been pretty wet. Uh

238
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,760
we're going to talk about temperature in

239
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
a minute, but when you look at sort of

240
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,919
rainfall across the region, there are

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,839
very very few places maybe along the

242
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,079
Great Lakes where we were a little bit

243
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,399
drier and it looks like the coast is

244
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
going to stay wetter uh than inland. So

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
if you're along the coast, you can

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
expect quite a bit of rainfall in the

247
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,000
next few days. It could be a wash out of

248
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,440
a weekend. Uh I hope I'm not in the

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
baseball business because I'll be

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,160
dragging a tarp a fair amount in this

251
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,399
kind in in this kind of weather. Um, in

252
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,799
the golf world, seed head suppression,

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,639
you're pretty late now for your first

254
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,879
application of proxy for the spring,

255
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,639
which seems very odd to be saying that,

256
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,120
but you're pretty late. And in if you

257
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,120
still have some embark lying around and

258
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
you're one of those folks that still use

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
embark, you still have a little bit of

260
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,759
time, particularly into upstate New York

261
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,399
and the Hudson Valley. Um, you know, we

262
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,519
were talking about soils in the low 50s,

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,240
uh, mid50s last week at the 2-in level,

264
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,039
and now you're hardressed to find a soil

265
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,440
in the 50s. And we talked to RT Gitano

266
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,879
who was our guest last week uh about

267
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
this. And of course, this in the

268
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,360
springtime, that two in soil temperature

269
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,399
is going to track the air temperature

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,759
pretty closely and even cooler uh with

271
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
moisture in there because, you know,

272
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,480
we're wet and we're cool and we've been

273
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,000
cooler than normal regionwide. uh you

274
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,159
know two to two to minus2 degrees at

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,440
normal, maybe a little bit above normal,

276
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,159
but not uh essentially uh what we would

277
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,880
think we'd be warming up. And it looks

278
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:30,078
like cool and wet is coming. The eight

279
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,278
to 14 day probabilities are looking like

280
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:36,000
at least for the next week, maybe until

281
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,000
May, we're going to be pretty wet and

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,360
cool, which you know, this is the pretty

283
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,078
typical spring stall that we talk about

284
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,320
every year. I mean, it was 17 degrees uh

285
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,479
just the other day in Ithaca and and I

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
and I I shuddered. I'm hoping that a lot

287
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
of fruit trees have not broken dormcancy

288
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,479
yet because then they're going to be in

289
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
all sorts of trouble. Now, when you put

290
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,800
all this together and we look at our

291
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,039
growth potential model, this is the map,

292
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,639
nice and easy to see, grass isn't

293
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,719
growing in New York State and it's not

294
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,039
going to be growing for a few more days

295
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,959
uh anytime soon. And so when you talk

296
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,559
about athletic fields, and I thought I'd

297
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,319
start out with a picture from Greg

298
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,879
Chorvis, a regular contributor and

299
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
listener to the program, uh sending a

300
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,958
picture from a local school district

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,120
that I think he worked with a while ago,

302
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,159
uh trying to help him out. And then

303
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,839
other people got involved, uh I maybe

304
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,879
you want to believe well-intentioned,

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,279
but not really smart, uh about just

306
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,278
dumping ditch material. Carl, do I have

307
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,078
this right? They cleaned out the

308
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:39,120
community ditches and they dumped it on

309
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:41,039
these baseball fields. Um, and

310
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
apparently that's not their only problem

311
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,360
because if you take a wrong step, you're

312
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,518
going to kill yourself on these stands.

313
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,600
So, it's obviously clear that the grass

314
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,399
isn't growing and fields aren't

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,800
necessarily in good shape. At this time

316
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,799
of year, you know, you get reports that

317
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,799
fields are being overused, especially

318
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,838
when they're not growing and they look

319
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,719
unsafe like this. you put kids on them

320
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,760
and all of a sudden you get hurt. Um,

321
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,639
and now we start to talk more about

322
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,399
faceplanting concussions. Uh, you know,

323
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
where, you know, concussion care for

324
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,120
parents and young people that are on

325
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,680
these fields. Again, we oftentimes think

326
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,159
of firmness, right? And concussions.

327
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,319
I've had some experience uh having to

328
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,519
report about concussions in division one

329
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,320
athletes from my time uh uh serving the

330
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,399
athletic department uh here at Cornell.

331
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,120
And uh a number of years ago, we put

332
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,000
together a concussion report from

333
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,799
various sports from football and soccer

334
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,519
to ice hockey, wrestling, and lacrosse.

335
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,240
And you can see uh we have many many

336
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,200
years where we're above average. uh

337
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,360
whether it's a men or woman sports, um

338
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,879
you can get a a high number of

339
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,079
concussions. Now, obviously, we're not

340
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,480
talking about ice uh in this particular

341
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,638
presentation, but we try to make

342
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,440
adaptations, right, guys? We try to make

343
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,519
adaptations to the game to try to

344
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,639
prevent this. And and the new kickoff

345
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,120
rule in football is is certainly a a

346
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,360
demonstration of that. It's a it's a a

347
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,360
small percentage of the number of plays

348
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,000
in a football game, American football

349
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,240
game, but but has a higher percentage of

350
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,559
concussion and injuries associated with

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,639
it. And of course, we go and test. And

352
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,799
this is where we start to get into the

353
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,600
discussion about firmness and testing.

354
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,240
And we care a lot about this, but it's

355
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,839
almost

356
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,039
non-existent at the high school and

357
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,279
collegate level that I'm aware of. In

358
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,599
fact, I would think it's safe to say

359
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,919
other than the companies that come in

360
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,240
and test the synthetic surfaces,

361
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,479
virtually no one in the Ivy League is

362
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,519
testing their surfaces for safety and

363
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,079
performance other than the uh synthetic

364
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,799
turf people that put that stuff in. So

365
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,638
just to remind everybody uh we have a

366
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,120
really good sports field management

367
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,440
website which we are in the process now

368
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,759
of updating and looking forward to

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,240
launching that in the next year uh in an

370
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,399
updated fashion. And of course there's

371
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,198
the best management practices for sports

372
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
fields that the

373
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,759
SFMA or back then the STMA the New

374
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
England people really led this charge

375
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,159
and you can find uh this publication

376
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,799
pretty easily on the web anywhere. Okay,

377
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,120
Carl. So now I'm ready for you. I was

378
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,240
recalling

379
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,759
recently that there was back in maybe

380
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:36,600
2002 or 2004 or

381
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:39,600
2006 in the middle of the season, Bill

382
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,040
Bellichic decides to pull out natural

383
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,240
grass and put in synthetic turf. Well,

384
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:49,360
now he's down at UNC with Little Wayne

385
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,720
and his new girlfriend, and he wants

386
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,919
natural grass. And I'm wondering what

387
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,360
this is about from one end to the other

388
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:02,240
where he is. And of course, early I was

389
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,639
talking about firmness. Now we're

390
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,600
talking about traction, which brings in

391
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,320
these multiple forces, right? Not just

392
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,839
the downward force, but these rotational

393
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,320
forces. And Carl, maybe I hope I set you

394
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,880
up enough to start the discussion with

395
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
Evan. Yeah. So Evan, you set it up

396
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,078
really well. the the direction of the

397
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,879
force and and how we measure that

398
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,799
probably matters. We've used uh and last

399
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,039
year we did this testing about twice a

400
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,719
week on our fields, a variety of fields

401
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,039
here at Cornell. And we've got the

402
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,600
really simple Turf Tech shear strength

403
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,958
tester. It's just that co-planer as

404
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,920
Kevin mentioned. You you stick it in the

405
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,638
ground, you rotate it, it gives you a a

406
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,078
shearing number, a force that uh the

407
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,198
maximum sort of force before that the

408
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,039
turf breaks. And there's different

409
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,319
things you can put on the bottom. Uh,

410
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,159
and when we looked at the data last

411
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,879
year, we were really looking at it for

412
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,639
our soccer teams. We have a Burman, uh,

413
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,559
for those watching the yellow line on

414
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,360
this graph, that's our game field.

415
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,958
Kentucky bluegrass predominantly. Not a

416
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,360
whole lot of practices, just games in

417
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,119
the fall. U McGovern is our practice

418
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,079
field. Both men's and women's have their

419
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,320
own field. It's a poor arai field uh,

420
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,838
and a satellite location. Uh, and when

421
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,320
we looked at the traction data last

422
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,000
year, that that Kentucky bluegrass

423
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
surface Burman had higher traction

424
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,480
numbers in the summer, but as we got

425
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,719
into the season, August, September, when

426
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
we start playing on that field, uh, they

427
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
really sort of narrowed to match the

428
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,199
McGovern field. And if we look at the

429
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,439
firmness data, if we look at the ball

430
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,120
roll data, they all did the same thing.

431
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
Burman was sort of different than the

432
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,039
practice field. And then they got they

433
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,078
they sort of uh, you know, coalesed

434
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,679
together towards the end of the year.

435
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,000
Now, part of that is probably more

436
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,758
rolling. Uh Chris Siko, our director of

437
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,519
grounds and sports turf, took the height

438
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,680
down a little bit on the bluegrass, but

439
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,519
what he also did was he added ryrass in

440
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,838
in June on that blueg grass field at

441
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,480
Burman. He got a great catch of of that

442
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,639
overseated rye. And as we saw that rye

443
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,759
come in, we saw the traction values go

444
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,839
down and start to match that poa rye

445
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,039
traction of the McGovern field. So now

446
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
we're starting to think about the growth

447
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,798
habit of the grass. Evan, you mentioned,

448
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,798
you know, that shearing is really a

449
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,199
function of sort of the vegetated growth

450
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,599
and organic material down below. So now

451
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,439
we're wondering like is that why that

452
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,198
that ryrass in place of bluegrass, is

453
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,519
that why we're seeing these things

454
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,558
coales? And then Evan, you guys measure

455
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,679
traction in a much more complicated way

456
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,759
uh with the beast, right? This this uh

457
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,120
huge machine, you're riding on it. I've

458
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,079
got some pictures on here. So now I want

459
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,159
to set you up, Evan. Why do you measure

460
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,678
traction in this sort of way? It looks

461
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,240
like it's coming in at different angles.

462
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,160
It's probably rotating. Why do we need

463
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,798
that? Whereas the traction device is

464
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,480
very simple. Uh is it too simple? Is it

465
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,000
really capturing everything we'd want to

466
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
know when when we're considering

467
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
traction?

468
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,679
As you alluded, there's excuse me,

469
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,798
there's a number of different variables

470
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,640
that we need to control in this

471
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,160
situation. you know, athletes have all

472
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,880
sorts of different sizes, different

473
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,120
cleat engagements, um, both within

474
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,600
within sports, within, you know, age age

475
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,639
groups, within even genders. And so,

476
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,639
this device, the Beast, is it's designed

477
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
very specifically around NFL size

478
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,799
athletes. Um, it is configurable, so the

479
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,600
weight stack can be changed, but this

480
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,759
was developed in response to a desire by

481
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,519
the league to, um, really attack lower

482
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,599
extremity injuries, which comprise about

483
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,759
60% of the injury burden in the league.

484
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,759
So the concussions often gets a lot of

485
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,279
the press, but in terms of total time

486
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,359
missed, the lower extremity injuries

487
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,678
actually play a little bit bigger role.

488
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,678
So this this device um one one of the

489
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,600
main t So that that's number one is that

490
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,679
it it it replicates the loads and the

491
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,319
forces associated with the extremely

492
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,360
large athletes in the NFL.

493
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay. So Carl, you mentioned yesterday

494
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,399
um which position, Evan, is it the

495
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,880
lineman who have to plant that

496
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,759
heavyweight? Is it the receiver who's

497
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,799
running lightly to make a cut? Uh is it

498
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,798
the quarterback who's stepping back and

499
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,119
playing? Where do you get the force you

500
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,839
want to replicate? Do you go to the most

501
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,959
extreme? Several years ago, there was a

502
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,399
a biomechanical study done with um

503
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,079
professional football athletes running

504
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
around on force plates, you know, highly

505
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,759
instrumented artificial turf surface to

506
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
get a sense of what are the vertical

507
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,879
loads, what are the shearing forces that

508
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,160
they actually apply to the surface, how

509
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
much can they use, how much do they

510
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,279
need, and this has been done at other

511
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,720
places in the literature in the past

512
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,960
both with American football and with

513
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,279
other athletes. So, we basically use uh

514
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,440
the 50th percentile NFL athlete to

515
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,279
represent this particular test. Okay.

516
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
And and the other thing that that we

517
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,798
found, and this actually persists across

518
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,799
sports, that generally the most

519
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,720
energetic maneuvers apply about two and

520
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,400
a half times the player's body weight to

521
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,120
the surface at the peak the peak

522
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,559
vertical loading. Whoa. Okay. So, just

523
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:50,000
to be clear,

524
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:52,240
300B uh um linemen are putting 800 lb or

525
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,679
700 pounds of force down. That's right.

526
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,279
That's why this device is so much it

527
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,880
looks so much bigger than an NFL athlete

528
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,839
because it is bigger. ways to talk more,

529
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
right? And the other, you know, the

530
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,759
other thing to think about positionally

531
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,759
is the mode of cleat engagement can

532
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,679
vary. You alluded to the linemen sort of

533
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,359
digging in at that lower angle with the

534
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,038
receivers. They may be be turning

535
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,038
abruptly to make a V-cut, but they're

536
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,279
also often accelerating and decelerating

537
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,119
at very high speeds. And often times

538
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,879
those high-speed decelerations are

539
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,959
associated with some of the non-cont

540
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
injuries like you referred to in the um

541
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
in the kickoffs. We certainly think of

542
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
the headto-head, you know, the the sort

543
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
of violent collisions between the

544
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
players and their helmets, but also that

545
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,679
hard deceleration is associated with a

546
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,599
lot of ACL injuries and other things in

547
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,320
that sphere.

548
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,959
All right, Carl, what's this? So, so

549
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,119
this is where I wanted to get to is uh

550
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,440
you guys presented at that Loftboro uh

551
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,000
international sport conference uh that

552
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,919
that you turned us on to last year. And

553
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,919
this this is data from the beast, right?

554
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,919
On a variety of different surfaces.

555
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,320
There's synthetic, there's Kentucky

556
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,840
bluegrass on its own, there's bluegrass

557
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,399
or ryrass stitched in with the

558
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,439
artificial, so these hybrid surfaces. Uh

559
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
maybe you could just talk a little bit

560
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
about some of the findings there, Evan,

561
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,720
and what's interesting about uh

562
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,479
different kinds of synthetic, different

563
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,839
kinds of natural, and maybe why we're

564
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,599
seeing the stuff at Burman with the

565
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,959
traction values differing now that we

566
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,399
added uh per eye in there. Totally.

567
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
Well, I'm always impressed at your guys'

568
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,240
ability to find, you know, from one link

569
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,159
to still information that you find

570
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
always the the critical thing. So yes,

571
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,280
as you mentioned, this was presented at

572
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,759
a sports engineering conference last

573
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,678
summer, summer of 2024, I guess. And

574
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,119
this is an experiment that we did uh at

575
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,960
a couple different locations, including

576
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,038
our plot here at Biocore. And the

577
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,079
different colors of lines represent the

578
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,359
traction response of each

579
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,678
surface. So if if you haven't seen a

580
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,759
graph like this before to the audience

581
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,600
to walk you through it, on the x-axis is

582
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,000
the degree of rotation. So, it's

583
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,719
measured in degrees starting out from um

584
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,640
the original cleat position and then

585
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
rotating through a full turn. And you'll

586
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,159
notice that it goes the axis goes all

587
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,919
the way up to 100 degrees, which if you

588
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,840
think about rotating your knee 100

589
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,120
degrees, that's well past where your

590
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,879
ligaments would start to give way.

591
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,639
Right? So, this is a we we refer to this

592
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
as an injury test. And we're interested

593
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,720
in not only the peak load that builds

594
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,440
up, but also the rate that it builds up

595
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,798
and um how much load is required to move

596
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
the cleat through a given amount of

597
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,639
rotation. So the y-axis here is the

598
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,320
torque which is actually the same unit

599
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
that you're measuring on that turf tech

600
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,158
shear vein. And you'll notice where the

601
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,400
numbers are are you know an order of

602
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,520
magnitude higher given the higher normal

603
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,038
force or the the vertical load. So each

604
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,720
of the again each of the lines

605
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,440
represents a different surface tested

606
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,200
with this this beast device. And you'll

607
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,798
notice there's a big span not only in

608
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,558
the peak load but also the displacement

609
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,400
associated with where the cleat releases

610
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,798
or where it reaches its maximum force.

611
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,720
So for the the synthetic turf lines on

612
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,798
the left, the gray ones, they're a lot

613
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
steeper and they also reach a higher

614
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,519
peak load. The the purplish lines

615
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,199
associated with the blue grass and the

616
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,519
um the stitched hybrids in the blue

617
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
grass at different densities, they tend

618
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,000
not to reach quite um as high peak load

619
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,440
and they take longer to do so. So that's

620
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
another thing we're interested in, not

621
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,759
only the total force that builds up, but

622
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,280
um how do you get to that point? And

623
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,480
that's one really cool thing that you

624
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,319
can measure with this sort of device

625
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,720
that isn't captured by a manual or

626
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,960
handheld device.

627
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,798
So, so Carl, before we get to the last

628
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,919
slide, Evan, in simple terms, this is

629
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,918
you plant your foot and you're more

630
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:25,200
likely to slip a little bit, right, on

631
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,679
natural grass and less likely to slip a

632
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,038
little bit on synthetic turf. And when I

633
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,519
say slip, I mean the subtlest of sort of

634
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,400
slippage that takes that energy away

635
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,319
from the joint. Is that a fair? I would

636
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,919
I would partially agree. I would shy

637
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,000
away from using the term slip. I think

638
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,720
often times when we see an athlete slip

639
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,720
or we refer to that, it's a more um it's

640
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,079
it's a less complete cle engagement. So

641
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,600
oftent times the studs may not be

642
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,119
penetrating all the way into the soil.

643
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,399
Maybe it's more like that initial

644
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,918
picture you showed of the golf ball

645
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,679
really just touching the whether it's

646
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,480
the thatch, the mat, however you want to

647
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,640
label that sort of intermingled organic

648
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,798
layer or sometimes in a very dense maybe

649
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
a ryrass surface that's wet and slick.

650
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,480
Sometimes the cleats don't engage fully.

651
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,480
That's not necessarily what this test is

652
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,480
after, but I do agree with the part

653
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,240
about um in general the grass is um more

654
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,319
we call it more compliant or not as

655
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,839
stiff and so it it does begin to to

656
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:22,240
release or to uh deform at least in a

657
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,599
more significant way. All right. So the

658
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,240
in my mind the $64,000 question is

659
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,519
where's the sweet spot? Where am I

660
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,480
getting maximum

661
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:37,440
performance and also or optimized

662
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,319
performance that also optimizes for my

663
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,640
safety, right? I mean, is it looks like

664
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,480
where they stitch where you put

665
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
synthetic fibers in and I know Ryan

666
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,278
Woodley's got this in the outfield now

667
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:54,960
at for the Brewers. Um uh it looks like

668
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:57,599
where they stitch it's it's it's stiffer

669
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,679
not less compliant you would say. Yes

670
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:03,759
that's correct. Does is it is it

671
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,480
worrisome is the stitching now are they

672
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,278
able to and I'm ass sure they are stitch

673
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,558
at different densities and does that

674
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,679
then change the stiffness and is that

675
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,240
the way to optim one of the ways to

676
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,159
optimize performance with safety I think

677
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,839
it is and so first of all just to

678
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,200
reiterate what you described there is a

679
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,639
sort of envelope right you have the

680
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,480
floor of traction where you need to have

681
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,240
some be able to run around it's it's not

682
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,000
like running on a beach but Then there's

683
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,480
some upper limit where there's a there's

684
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
a concern that the foot can become

685
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,919
fixated. And to answer the second part

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,679
of your question, I think the purple so

687
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
the purple and the blue lines hopefully

688
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,480
for people that can see you're not color

689
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,439
blind. I think this is actually colorb

690
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,360
blind uh friendly color palette. And um

691
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
Carl, I know you're an R user. This is a

692
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,959
colorblind R package by Claus Wilky.

693
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,558
Okay. Um in any case, the four so the

694
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,159
four purple lines, you've got the bottom

695
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,480
solid, which is just the pure Kentucky

696
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,000
bluegrass, and then stitched at three

697
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,159
different densities. And so we find that

698
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,720
the higher the fiber volume within a

699
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,799
given area or root zone volume, as you

700
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,798
might expect, that the traction becomes

701
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,798
stiffer and more significant in terms of

702
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,158
the peak load. And so that's it's

703
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,158
interesting because it suggests that you

704
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,600
can control the available traction

705
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
depending on the way the surface is

706
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,599
constructed. The blue lines are

707
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,960
bermutarass with the same stitching

708
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,959
rates. And you'll notice they're

709
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,038
squashed together a little bit more. And

710
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,558
so we would hypothesize that this is

711
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,038
probably because the Bermuda grass

712
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,119
already has such a robust network of the

713
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,240
roots and underground stems that it

714
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,158
doesn't I would I'll use the word

715
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,440
benefit. I don't know if we mean that

716
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,200
you know correct but at least

717
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,519
directionally it doesn't um it's not

718
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,759
enhanced in terms of traction by as much

719
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,839
as the bluegrass might be. And there's

720
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,400
maybe why Bellich likes the natural

721
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,240
grass going down south or or the Bermuda

722
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
grass going down south. Oh, there you

723
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,558
are coming to his defense. If I'm

724
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,120
throwing a Hail Mary there on on my

725
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,200
hypothesis, maybe that's why we we like

726
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,199
natural grass on on the warm seasons

727
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,798
that have and a lot of times it comes

728
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,400
down to this debate of grass versus

729
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,240
turf. And it's really not as simple as

730
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,240
that. And this graph doesn't really

731
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,759
depict that super well, but if if you

732
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,919
squint, you can actually see one gray

733
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,440
line that is beneath two of the blue

734
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,880
lines, which is a hybrid, and kind of

735
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,480
right in the carpet, the yellow carpet

736
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,240
hybrid. So there are some grasses which

737
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,599
have higher traction loads and

738
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,919
especially when they're hybridized than

739
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,359
some of the synthetic fields. So often

740
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,640
times, you know, coaches especially will

741
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,240
get an idea in their head that I want

742
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
grass, I want turf, and it's not really

743
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
an absolute. And I I'll also just point

744
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,678
out that since that happened, I don't

745
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,480
remember the year exactly, it was early

746
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,080
2000s, right? The the technology and the

747
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
skill of the sod growers has really

748
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,798
evolved. And so um grass grass in that

749
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,159
era probably not so comparable to some

750
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,240
of the grass that you can obtain even

751
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,159
late in the season. Now, now it is

752
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,319
interesting because uh as we've talked

753
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,840
about or will talk about more over the

754
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,038
show is, you know, when the World Cup

755
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,119
comes, they're going to play on that

756
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,480
carpet hybrid grass, right? That's

757
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:55,599
that's the natural grass planted in a

758
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,000
synthetic surface. Um and that looks

759
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,839
like it's um you know, pretty strong.

760
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,440
Now, it's a different animal to a

761
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,278
certain extent with soccer. They they

762
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,519
like that ball to skid, right? It's a

763
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,480
round ball sport, but it does look like

764
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:11,440
it's closer to synthetic as far as

765
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,278
traction or less compliant, so to speak,

766
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,880
uh, than it is to natural grass. So, I'm

767
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,720
wondering, um, that that's that if they

768
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,720
they can also play around with fiber

769
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,558
density in that hybrid as well. And I'm

770
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
sure they're going to use this data to

771
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,158
determine what's the best way to go

772
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,000
there. Now, John's pretty smart guy.

773
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,679
Definitely. And I again, I want to be

774
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,200
clear, this is only three products that

775
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,720
we tested. One of them we sort of made

776
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,558
ourselves like a homemade kind of off

777
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
label carpet hybrid with super high

778
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,079
fiber density. And so this doesn't

779
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,359
necessarily reflect the suite of

780
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,119
products that would be available or

781
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,119
might come become available anyway.

782
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,119
Okay. All right, Carl, here's your last

783
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,639
slide. Let's wrap it up here. Well, so

784
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,079
the great thing is that Evan already

785
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,679
nailed this for us. I was going to ask

786
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,199
the question are different athletes

787
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,798
different loads and and Evan, you

788
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,319
already answered that. The other part I

789
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,079
liked about this slide, Frank, was uh

790
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,798
Declan Rice there, my guy for Arsenal

791
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,639
Football Club with two gorgeous free

792
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,079
kick goals against Real Madrid the other

793
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,440
day. Just top level. So, so we answered,

794
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,038
you know, the idea that, you know, maybe

795
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,679
different sports and different athletes

796
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,960
win within a sport. Lineman, receivers

797
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,480
experience loads differently. But I got

798
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,079
a question from from Ben Palmer who

799
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,599
asked here. Evan, I don't know how much

800
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,319
you can talk about this, but you guys

801
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,918
collect data for the NFL. Um, are there

802
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,599
instances where the turf and a lot of

803
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,278
that is safety data, right? Are these

804
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,879
fields safe? Do we look at injury rates?

805
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,278
Probably you can't comment too much on

806
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,960
that, but have the turf managers used

807
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,119
that data that you collect and

808
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,679
implemented certain practices that

809
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,678
allowed them to get to, you know, higher

810
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,759
or lower on the traction scale? Is is

811
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,440
there anything you can talk to about um

812
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,079
sort of the turf managers at stadiums

813
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
using that data from you guys? Yeah, the

814
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,079
turf managers um in general are pretty

815
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,079
excited about having another tool to

816
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,759
look at to track and monitor things over

817
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,519
time. We're still sort of in the infancy

818
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,720
of determining how do you go from a

819
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,839
traction measurement to something you

820
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
want to do. There's there's a pretty

821
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,480
good amount of research in the

822
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,759
literature using other traction devices

823
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,759
about how to influence the shootute

824
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,200
density and potentially the root mass.

825
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,119
The other thing we're excited about is

826
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,640
working with the the manufacturers and

827
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,639
the sod growers because a lot of times

828
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,080
they govern kind of what you're able to

829
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,840
deal with once you're the field in the

830
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,278
field manager scenario. And in the

831
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,000
high-end football cases obviously

832
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,839
there's um a pretty frequent replacement

833
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,679
schedule associated with concerts and

834
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,879
also with the high use. So, we

835
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,159
definitely look forward to providing

836
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,799
them, you know, more things that are

837
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,559
useful and um that's going to be a focus

838
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,918
moving forward. And well, and I can't

839
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,678
let you go without having some

840
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,600
conversation. And I know we're really

841
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,759
we're over to 30 minutes, Carl. So, we

842
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,119
weren't as fast as we want to be, but I

843
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,480
do want to ask a question about

844
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,000
something you just said there, Evan,

845
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,919
which is boy, you you really enjoy being

846
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
able to work with the sod growers, and

847
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,919
it feels like turf grass managers can

848
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,399
make adaptations in the things that they

849
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,240
manage. Um, do you find the same thing

850
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,479
to be true with synthetic turf

851
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,519
manufacturers and people that can manage

852
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,360
those fields or are you more constrained

853
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,359
when you get a particular type of

854
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,519
synthetic field based on what you've

855
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,879
seen in the NFL? Well, this is one of

856
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,319
the beautiful things about natural

857
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,159
grass, right? That it can be shaped and

858
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,759
molded, you know, ecologically depending

859
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,520
on what the management variables are.

860
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,359
And sort of the sports turf manager is

861
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,440
the most critical, you know, the spoon

862
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,798
that stirs the pot, so to speak. I do

863
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,558
think there's appetite in the synthetic

864
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,960
turf world and you see how it's evolved

865
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,038
from, you know, the the sort of dark

866
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,120
ages of stadium construction, the donut

867
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,640
hole stadiums, you know, in the 1970s

868
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,439
and the turf that people used to play on

869
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,440
then compared to what it is now. And uh

870
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,200
sometimes how quickly we forget both on

871
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,278
the natural grass side going back to the

872
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,880
early 90s playing in the Super Bowl

873
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,278
stadiums and then also the artificial

874
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,519
turf. So I think both both ends of that

875
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,960
um dichotomy have have progressed pretty

876
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,200
significantly and will continue to do

877
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,440
so.

878
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,600
What a very good answer, Evan. You are

879
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,000
gonna make a really good senior engineer

880
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,079
from Biocore. All right, Carl, we're

881
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,398
here. It's Evan, it's so great to chat

882
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,879
with you. Anytime we can bring up first

883
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,038
principle things, right, Carl? Uh with

884
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,600
with forces and things like that. We're

885
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,000
very happy uh to talk about engineering

886
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,240
with a couple of uh not so bad for a

887
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,480
turf grass guy who turned out to be an

888
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,319
engineer with Biocore. Well done, Evan.

889
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,159
I think your brewers need some pitching,

890
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,158
though. I'm pretty sure Brewers need

891
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,760
some pitching. Your your Pirates need

892
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,399
some pitching, too, other than that one

893
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:20,079
guy. Okay, Carl. Good to see you both.

894
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,359
Thanks very much, Evan. Everybody,

895
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,599
thanks for joining us. We'll see you

896
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,918
next week. See you next week. Take care.

897
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,798
Thanks a lot, Ev. See you, bud. This has

898
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,000
been a production of Cornell University

899
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,000
