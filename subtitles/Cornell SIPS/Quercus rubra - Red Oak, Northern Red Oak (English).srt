1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,790
&gt;&gt; Quercus rubra, red oak,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,679
a native around this area,

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:07,410
large tree with distinctively lobed,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,410
sharply lobed leaves, typically seven lobes.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,039
The distinguishing feature on this tree is

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,179
the cluster of buds at the terminal is a chestnut brown,

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,655
highly imbricate, lots of scales

8
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,789
overlapping at the end of the branch.

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,890
So imbricate, chestnut brown buds on Quercus rubra or red oak.
