1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,919
thanks so much to dawn and for everybody

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,109
here and also in Geneva look at that

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:20,509
turnout in Geneva thank you guys so much

6
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:22,278
for coming out although I just want to

7
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:25,250
reiterate something that John said that

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:27,649
this is a truly fabulous award and I

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,439
think anybody who has any interest in

10
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:33,679
doing travel after they graduate or can

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,780
think of a project that involves travel

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,909
as part of your part of your graduate

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,840
education I think it's a really

14
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:43,449
fantastic opportunity and I was

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,830
personally very excited to get this so

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,150
I'm also really excited to talk to you

17
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:53,929
today about my experience in Tasmania so

18
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:56,000
where are we going we are going to test

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,859
media and I'm going to start by

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,509
introducing my research a little bit to

21
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,789
give you a little bit about context

22
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:05,239
about why I even went to Tasmania to

23
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:07,728
begin with move into an introduction to

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,478
Tasmania kind of give you a whirlwind

25
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:13,099
tour through pictures of the state and

26
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,560
then talk about the research that I did

27
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,959
in tazi and then hopefully at the end

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,060
I'll have time for some questions and

29
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,839
the pictures that are accompanying the

30
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,490
slides aren't always completely a

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,650
topical about what's on the slide but I

32
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:29,750
you know it's hard when you have so many

33
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,060
pictures and you want to show off the

34
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,849
beauty of a place so enjoy the pictures

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,629
and also try to look at the data that's

36
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:40,609
on the slides if you can so I'm going to

37
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:43,579
start off by talking about sour rod and

38
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:45,829
this is the disease that I work on as

39
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,368
part of my PhD project and when i

40
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:51,798
arrived at cornell in 2013 sour raw was

41
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:54,019
a very poorly understood disease we

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,960
didn't really understand what caused it

43
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:59,390
how it spread where it even was in the

44
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,599
world but we did know that it typically

45
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,939
develops on tight cluster thin-skinned

46
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,579
varieties of grapes we start to see a

47
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:09,348
discoloration starting at about 15

48
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,750
bricks and then really the

49
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:13,759
characteristic of the disease is that we

50
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,969
smell vinegar really emanating from

51
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,439
these clusters

52
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,240
wounds appear to exacerbate the rod and

53
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,030
then we start to see damaged berries

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,530
ooze and we see drosophila or fruit

55
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,419
flies swarming around the clusters and

56
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,390
so far we've seen it in new york ontario

57
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,859
oregon washington california and then

58
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:35,559
also reports of it in France and

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,150
Portugal and you can see here this is a

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,189
picture of shower rod on Pinot Noir and

61
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,900
spoiler alert this is from Tasmania so

62
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:47,979
it turns out I did find it there which

63
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,900
was very good for my research it's a

64
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:53,949
particularly disgusting picture of sour

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,180
rot if you leave it alone and let it do

66
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:57,280
its thing and I'm sorry for the

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,439
horticulturist in the room pathologists

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,659
we just love this kind of stuff so this

69
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,550
is truly disgusting examples of sour

70
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:05,500
rods so some of the questions that I've

71
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,180
asked as part of my PhD research are

72
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,699
what are the identities of the

73
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,219
microorganisms that cause sour rot what

74
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,109
is the epidemiology of the disease what

75
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:17,709
is the role of vinegar flies or fruit

76
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,840
flies and then also is Sarah rot found

77
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:22,299
in other cool climate viticultural

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,439
regions which is what brings me to Tess

79
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:30,280
mania so where is Tasmania so I was

80
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:32,979
asked a lot of times if I was going to

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,610
Tanzania and no in fact I did not go to

82
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:39,189
Africa I went to Australia and so

83
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:43,060
Tasmania is this nice little state down

84
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:45,430
here at the bottom of Australia and it

85
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,400
is very much unlike the rest of

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,810
Australia in a lot of ways so kind of

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,180
form a picture of what you think of

88
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,709
Australia in your mind and then I'll

89
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,090
venture into some pictures and you can

90
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,579
see the contrast it's just a very

91
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,829
different place than the images we have

92
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,170
in our mind of kangaroos bouncing

93
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,049
through you know ayers rock or coolaroo

94
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:08,859
in the background just a very different

95
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:11,739
place and so here is the state of of

96
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,660
Tasmania and down at the bottom we have

97
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,730
Hobart which is the capital which is

98
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,589
where I was primarily based and the

99
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,538
other major city in the state is

100
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:23,810
launceston which is up in the northern

101
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:26,180
part and I'm going to kind of give you

102
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,410
this is your whirlwind photo tour of the

103
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,139
state so we're going to go in this

104
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,389
counterclockwise fashion and you'll get

105
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,668
to see some beautiful shots of of the

106
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,449
state and hopefully kind of give you a

107
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:40,399
taste for what Tasmania looks like and

108
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:42,589
just kind of give you this this feeling

109
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,039
for the place that I tried to get over

110
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:50,569
my five months there so starting out

111
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:53,060
just east of Hobart here dhola right is

112
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,550
the type of rock that forms these

113
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,819
amazing formations and it's actually a

114
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,629
type of igneous rock it's made of it was

115
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:05,449
magma that rose out of the center of the

116
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:08,259
earth when Tasmania was separating from

117
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:11,418
gondwana so this was a really amazing

118
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:13,370
kind of event obviously in the history

119
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:15,649
of our earth and when Tasmania was one

120
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,629
of the last pieces to break off right

121
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,810
before Antarctica broke off of Gondwana

122
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:22,579
and when it did these massive formation

123
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,379
literally came out of the center of the

124
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,569
earth and formed these coastline these

125
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,519
rock formations on the coastline that

126
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:33,199
are like nothing else I've ever seen in

127
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:35,120
my life just truly phenomenal and just

128
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,339
you know covering these coastlines you

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,500
can see them in the background and you

130
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:45,199
can also hiked out on top of them

131
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,209
there's unlike Tasmania is a state that

132
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,180
I mean it's an island right so water

133
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:54,259
dominates everything around it but just

134
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,819
this vastness of very few people

135
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,199
actually living there there's only half

136
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,740
a million people on the entire island

137
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,959
and this really vast space and

138
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,699
completely gorgeous beaches you can see

139
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,149
from the white sand beaches that it's

140
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:11,180
primarily course that has made these

141
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:13,969
white sands and gorgeous waters now it

142
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,009
is unlike a lot of the rest of Australia

143
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,470
where it is this is cool climate so I

144
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:22,099
was there in the summer time it did get

145
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,620
hot we were it was a drought year but

146
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,439
you I mean it does get cold when by the

147
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,209
time I left

148
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:34,959
at the end of May it was down to 33 34

149
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:37,449
degrees we got a frost I mean it was it

150
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,339
was cold so not really what you'd think

151
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,769
of normally when you think of Australia

152
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,750
so this is the northeastern coast we're

153
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:48,479
kind of moving up towards launceston at

154
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,740
this point and this is the type of

155
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,310
unbelievable land formations that you

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,920
see when you go out hiking mountains and

157
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,550
on also these white sand beaches and

158
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,949
this is the first of a few is mrs. and

159
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,590
that i'm going to show you photos of and

160
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,529
so the kind of bay on your right is

161
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:11,379
called wineglass bay and just a really

162
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:13,569
picturesque setting and again with these

163
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,610
unbelievable rock formations and some of

164
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:18,639
this you know a lot of the the landscape

165
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:22,360
of tasmania was formed through a lot of

166
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,750
periods of glaciation mountains being

167
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,199
formed and then being covered by water

168
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:33,509
and then the water receding and so just

169
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,279
really carved out and diverse geography

170
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,319
and so it's moving to the center of the

171
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,019
state it starts to look extremely

172
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,139
different you see this low-lying brush

173
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:47,649
and this portion of the state which

174
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:50,860
isn't really high altitude it's very

175
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:55,810
harsh climate so we're looking at cold

176
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,040
damp very swampy and you can see this is

177
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,980
in the middle of the state where we're

178
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,200
not near the ocean at this point and

179
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,879
lots of standing water and just unlike

180
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,289
just very interesting rock formations

181
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:11,189
and low-lying brush but still mountains

182
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,050
and so these are the types of I

183
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,699
I have to include these types of use cuz

184
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,540
they're spectacular and it really just

185
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,849
gives a view of what Tasmania has to

186
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,980
offer in terms of just unbelievable

187
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,260
beauty and being from Oregon originally

188
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,360
I mean this was I'm into this this is

189
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:32,759
gorgeous and wonderful hiking and

190
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,330
wombats which I know I can't show

191
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:39,090
pictures of Australia without showing

192
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,538
pictures of its creatures and so wombats

193
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,990
are hilarious and they're often in these

194
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:48,299
sort of low plain areas digging holes

195
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,919
and being hilarious and can't they are

196
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,659
not deterred they don't care about

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,979
people at all they just dig their holes

198
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:59,069
and eat all day long this is cradle

199
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,490
mountain which is a beautiful spot in

200
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,080
the center of Tasmania just unbelievable

201
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,230
peaks and then this really interesting

202
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:12,420
vegetation we almost see palm like trees

203
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,420
in the center and as we move kind of

204
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,579
into the southwest part of the state

205
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:21,569
this is all World Heritage Area and so

206
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,920
really you this is all park land there's

207
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,540
no one who lives in this part of the

208
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,819
state at all it's all really unlike a

209
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:34,709
pretty amazing hiking trails backpacking

210
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:38,580
trails and this part is a damned area

211
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:40,290
which has formed this lake and this is

212
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,120
literally where the roads end in the

213
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,439
southwest and so you can't drive any

214
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,940
further than this if you want to

215
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,620
continue down into the southwest part of

216
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,140
the state you're looking at a 7 to 10

217
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,090
days backpacking trip down to the ocean

218
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:55,230
and this little guy in the front is a

219
00:09:51,090 --> 00:10:02,649
spotted pole he's quite adorable Cole

220
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:05,120
hey qu oll a tiny or soup you'll

221
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,769
and then as we head back towards Hobart

222
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,009
we start to see just a really stark

223
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:14,110
change in vegetation almost jungle like

224
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:17,059
with palm trees and huge fern also

225
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,870
dolomite caves not dola right but all of

226
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:23,268
my caves are pretty prevalent and also

227
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,589
home to platypus which I never saw so I

228
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:29,419
still have no proof that they really

229
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:31,250
exist and then back to the Isthmus on

230
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:34,338
bruny island which is only about an hour

231
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,169
outside of Hobart and just some this is

232
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,070
where Captain Cook originally arrived

233
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:45,349
when he came to this part of the world

234
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:48,560
and just spectacular views and just to

235
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,540
reiterate Tasmania is cold for a lot of

236
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,179
parts of the year so this is me

237
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:55,039
backpacking and I do indeed have a lot

238
00:10:53,179 --> 00:11:00,319
of clothes on because it was rainy and

239
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,759
chilly and so worth it as well and so

240
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,100
this is the view from top of Mount

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,679
Wellington which is in Hobart and this

242
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,990
is looking over Hobart and the haziness

243
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,899
that you see here is from the controlled

244
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,930
burns of the eucalyptus that the

245
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,759
firefighters were in charge of doing and

246
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:19,489
that's because the seeds of the

247
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:23,208
eucalyptus require fire in order to

248
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,669
germinate so but by the time the end of

249
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,500
the winter was approaching these

250
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:31,039
controlled burns were going almost all

251
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,078
the time and we're back in Hobart now

252
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:37,750
and this is Mount Wellington and again

253
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,750
with the dolerite pipe

254
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:44,778
uh no I mean it might just be the light

255
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,910
to be honest but there is like a redness

256
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:50,059
in those rocks that is pretty pretty

257
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:51,559
phenomenal and then a wall beats I can't

258
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,119
not show a wallaby and these guys are

259
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,809
everywhere and basically think about

260
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,850
deer and how deer everywhere in Ithaca

261
00:11:55,809 --> 00:12:00,739
the Wallabies and the smaller cousins

262
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,420
patty melons those are everywhere as

263
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,870
well and on campus at the University

264
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:09,708
Tasmania hopping around and so here is

265
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,078
Hobart from Mount Wellington and we see

266
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,809
so if you were to look down in this part

267
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,328
this is where the University of Tasmania

268
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:20,750
campus is so not too shabby looking over

269
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:24,469
the ocean there so Hobart self has a

270
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:30,139
really rich but also very conflicting

271
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:31,550
past with a completely wipe there was a

272
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,309
clay wipe out of the aboriginal

273
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:37,429
population when the Europeans arrived

274
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:41,179
and so it's a quite devastating history

275
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:44,599
to learn about and then also at all of

276
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:47,629
Tasmania was a penal colony and so the

277
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,870
island itself was the prison and so a

278
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:53,269
lot and I would say most of the older

279
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,639
buildings were convict silks including

280
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:58,370
my little house that I lived in down

281
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:02,088
there in the corner that was built by

282
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,730
convicts in the 1880s and so just the

283
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,339
history is very is everywhere who

284
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,320
prevalent also from an agricultural

285
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,279
standpoint there is a rich history of

286
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:17,510
apple growing and a lot of southern

287
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:20,600
tasmania has apple orchards and just a

288
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,730
lot of and quince quince and apples and

289
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,740
a lot of interesting history involving

290
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,940
that type of farming and then also and

291
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,198
then more recently a move into grapes so

292
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,180
I was based at the University of

293
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,338
Tasmania and I worked primarily with

294
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:36,139
Cathy Evans who was based at the Hobart

295
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,670
campus but I also worked with Fiona

296
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,088
Kerslake who was a junior research

297
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:42,948
fellow up in launceston in the northern

298
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,690
part of the state and so I kind of split

299
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:48,159
my time between the two of them but was

300
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:53,050
primarily based that's my lab was at

301
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:56,828
in Hobart at the Utah's campus and I

302
00:13:53,049 --> 00:14:00,370
worked a lot with Cathy so the major

303
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:03,159
Biddle cultural areas in Tasmania I've

304
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,110
highlighted them here but the three that

305
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,698
i worked in primarily where the coal

306
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,620
River Valley the Derwent Valley in the

307
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:10,750
Tamar Valley and the tan Marvel you can

308
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,459
see up near launceston the Coal River

309
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,948
Valley ins of Derwent Valley down your

310
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:18,278
cobarde so this is where I primarily

311
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:19,659
split my time and in the coal River

312
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:21,720
Valley i worked with two commercial

313
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:24,429
vineyards the derwent valley with 10 and

314
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,490
in the tamar valley to other commercial

315
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:29,979
vineyards this was all organized by

316
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,870
Fiona and Cathy which I was just so

317
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,490
grateful that they were able to do some

318
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,039
ground work for me so in terms of

319
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,818
northern tasmania while i was there

320
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:41,438
there was a series of brush fires that

321
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:45,909
started right a couple weeks after i

322
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:47,919
arrived and persisted for a big portion

323
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,328
of the time that i was there and so you

324
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,799
can see on the left hand side that's my

325
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:52,000
view from one of the vineyards that i

326
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,769
was working in and you can see the

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,220
burning happening in the big plumes of

328
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:59,350
smoke and then this the orange skies at

329
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,269
night in launceston were from the brush

330
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,159
fires as well and though there was a lot

331
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,649
of conversation about smoke taint and

332
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,909
how it would impact wine quality there

333
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:10,240
was a lot of research going on at that

334
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:12,399
time by fiona actually about how the

335
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,339
brush fires are going to impact the wine

336
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,990
quality so i don't know i haven't heard

337
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,459
from her lately but I had heard that

338
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,709
people were feeling pretty helpful about

339
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:26,469
it that there wasn't a lot of damage to

340
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:29,438
the grapes in the end and then the

341
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,720
hobart area and Coal River Valley was

342
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:34,360
going through a mean the whole state was

343
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,680
going through a drought but pull River

344
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,209
Valley was visibly drier than whenever I

345
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,258
was up in the Tama or Valley Tim our

346
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:46,448
Valley lot more humid and just a lot

347
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:48,379
muggier where is a lot drier down in

348
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:51,559
Coal River

349
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:57,080
and from a viticultural standpoint I

350
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:59,989
mean viticulture in in Tasmania looked

351
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,190
to look very familiar to me there wasn't

352
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,129
a lot of differences in terms of

353
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,840
training systems or trellising looked

354
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,689
very very similar to what we were used

355
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,870
what I was used to be a lot of the SP

356
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:16,220
train finds the everything was irrigated

357
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:18,320
and just very familiar viticultural

358
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,330
techniques because a lot of them has

359
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,629
been brought over by Europeans

360
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:26,150
originally and so in terms of my three

361
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:28,129
research components I'm going to start

362
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,590
talking about just these three the

363
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:32,720
Illumina sequencing component looking at

364
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:37,190
sour rock causal organisms and then also

365
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,350
the environmental effects so the

366
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,940
question that kind of guided this the

367
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,710
Illumina sequencing component was at

368
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,540
what epiphytic microbes are present on

369
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,000
the grape surface so I had three years

370
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:49,009
of data on this topic from the Finger

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,549
Lakes and I wanted to also expand this

372
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:54,409
to Tasmania and so my goal here is to

373
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:56,059
understand the presence and changes in

374
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,669
yeast and bacteria over the course of

375
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:01,009
the growing season and how I did this

376
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:02,899
and one of the reasons that I needed to

377
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:05,119
arrive so early in the growing season in

378
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:08,449
Tasmania was because I worked in five

379
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,639
commercial vineyards and did DNA

380
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,650
extractions on grapes starting at

381
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,810
pea-sized berry to very early on in the

382
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,509
season and then took samples at

383
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:20,389
pea-sized bunch closure brazen 15 bricks

384
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:25,068
and at harvest and then using amplicon

385
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:28,880
sequencing with i TS and 16s primers to

386
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:31,750
amplify fungal and bacterial DNA so it

387
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,790
was a it's a huge project and

388
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,190
unfortunately because of it being a big

389
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:39,920
project I do not have data to show you

390
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,070
on that but it is going into a very

391
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,120
large paper that we are we're working on

392
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,429
and

393
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,109
I'm excited that the research from the

394
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,860
drear is going to go into a paper that

395
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:53,389
will be out next year so well I see

396
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,959
Lance over there so fingers crossed that

397
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,000
it'll be out next year so the next

398
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,100
question that I wanted to answer is sour

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,130
rot found in Tasmania and obviously I

400
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:06,619
already answered or spoiled it for

401
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,830
everybody and yes it is in fact found in

402
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:11,709
Tasmania this is an echidna by the way

403
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:15,889
he was hanging out in the vineyard and

404
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:18,470
amazing so cute so in terms of style rot

405
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,259
infants and incidence and severity I

406
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,569
took incidence Insperity raiden ratings

407
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:25,460
every five days until harvest out of

408
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:28,759
commercial vineyards in Hobart and this

409
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:31,130
was just it was a vineyard actually that

410
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:34,879
my husband was working at at the time

411
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,890
and he said hey we have sour rot here

412
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
because fortunately I have trained him

413
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,390
very well to recognize shower rod

414
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,640
symptoms and so I went out there and

415
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,070
every five days I took disease and

416
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,450
incidence ratings and here are some of

417
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:51,109
the examples of the first that I found

418
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,360
from there so and if we look at those

419
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:56,899
incidents and severity ratings we see an

420
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,659
exponential increase in the amount of

421
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,330
disease in this field and you know part

422
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,150
of this is that there is so little

423
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:06,949
education of these sorts of disease on

424
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:11,480
these sorts of disease symptoms and also

425
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:14,000
there are very few tools available to

426
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,230
growers for sour rot partially because

427
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,269
they're there aren't any real label

428
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,740
products for it especially not in terms

429
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,839
of insecticide so there's nothing to

430
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,179
target the drosophila so once the

431
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,849
disease starts it progresses

432
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:32,210
exponentially and we really see this is

433
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:34,250
a huge amount of disease to the point

434
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,950
where the grower really was dropping the

435
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,380
fruit on the ground underneath of the

436
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,500
vines and I tried to part of the

437
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,680
occasion was telling you don't drop the

438
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,700
fruit under the vine

439
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,990
because if the disease being spread by

440
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,819
drosophila the drosophila are going to

441
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,559
continue breeding in your grapes and

442
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:56,329
then go up into the canopy and spread it

443
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,789
more which is exactly what it did and so

444
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:02,939
it was an educational process for me as

445
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:05,369
well to know that you know these are the

446
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,500
types of measures that needed to be

447
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,939
communicated as well remove that fruit

448
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,619
from the vineyard get it out of there

449
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,759
don't let it sit underneath those vines

450
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:13,759
and continue spreading the disease

451
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,849
that's a Tasmanian devil uh just in case

452
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,490
you guys were wondering about whether

453
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,869
they were there they are indeed you

454
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,559
talked about them for two seconds and

455
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:30,569
then get back to science that they

456
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,779
somebody asked me about this earlier so

457
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:36,149
they do suffer from a facial tumor that

458
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,769
has been devastating their population in

459
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,180
Tasmania but there are several breeding

460
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:44,460
programs which have been very successful

461
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:46,380
at reintroducing resistant Devils back

462
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,610
into the wild and they've been doing

463
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,310
really really well they've had huge

464
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:54,209
success and actually I saw one while

465
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,639
backpacking and out on island one like

466
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,579
wandered up to the campsite and a little

467
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,230
too friendly for my liking but yeah so

468
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:05,490
they are there and they work you so we

469
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,190
one question we really wanted to know

470
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,410
about sour wat was are there the same

471
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,160
causal organisms for sour odd in

472
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,779
Tasmania as there are here and basically

473
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,150
what we know about that is that we

474
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,460
require yeast and bacteria and fruit

475
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,950
flies in order to cause our rod and was

476
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,799
that the same answer as where are those

477
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,900
the same causes in Tasmania and so what

478
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,849
I did was I washed took a wash of three

479
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,540
berries on each of ten clusters from six

480
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:36,750
vineyards played them out and then sent

481
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:39,359
to rest of each / sequencing

482
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,099
and what I found was very encouraging so

483
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,669
yes things are very consistent with what

484
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:47,759
we what we see in the US and in the

485
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:50,550
Finger Lakes is that yeast its present

486
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:53,519
in very high quantities as well as

487
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:56,759
acetic acid bacteria which is what we

488
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,160
had been crossing our fingers for but

489
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,500
also we found so we were very very happy

490
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,300
to see that the yeast and bacteria were

491
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,579
present in the samples and that these

492
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,289
are the same these are the same species

493
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:11,669
that we see here in the Finger Lakes as

494
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:13,500
well so no big surprises but also very

495
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,980
exciting to see for the first time that

496
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,559
we can tie a shower rod and Tasmania

497
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,319
sits however out here so in terms of

498
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,769
environmental factors where we were

499
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:29,009
looking at whether we could put some

500
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:32,000
hobo data loggers out into the field and

501
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:36,569
take measurements every 10 minutes for

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,549
11 days and track temperature dew point

503
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:40,019
relative humidity a whole bunch of

504
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,940
environmental factors and see if we

505
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:46,490
could correlate them with sour odd

506
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:50,519
symptoms and what we found at that same

507
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,460
vineyard in outside of Hobart where I

508
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,559
had the very high levels of incidence

509
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,559
and severity of Sarah rot is that I was

510
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:02,339
able to correlate maximum daily dew

511
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,500
point very well with my severity ratings

512
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,659
which just meant that it gave me a

513
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,750
jumping off point to when I returned to

514
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:13,769
the finger lakes that we could further

515
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:15,390
study the like further study temperature

516
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,769
and relative humidity and maybe there

517
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:21,180
was a correlation there that we wanted

518
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:24,059
to look further at and kind of

519
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,920
conversely in another vineyard where I

520
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,779
suspected there would be sour out but

521
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,330
there didn't end up being any we saw

522
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,859
that opposite trend so there was a

523
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:33,990
downward trend of maximum daily dew

524
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:36,689
point and this was sort of just a

525
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,450
jumping off point for us to delve deeper

526
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,920
into the environmental

527
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:46,440
that would be causing susceptibility and

528
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,060
the last component just that I think is

529
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,830
very important and I kind of touched on

530
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,309
a little bit was I worked a lot with

531
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:56,309
growers when I was down there to educate

532
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:58,259
both growers and the crews about how to

533
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,990
identify cell rot and how to manage it

534
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,230
there are a lot of backpackers down

535
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,599
there who work in vineyards to support

536
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,700
their traveling and a lot of them have

537
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,129
never worked in agriculture let alone

538
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,360
vineyard and so they're seeing grapes

539
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,340
for the first time they're harvesting

540
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,529
grapes for the first time and so there's

541
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:18,569
a ton of Education to do and also the

542
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,519
crew changes every year so it's a brand

543
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:23,669
new group of people and so talking to

544
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,410
the vineyard managers about what's our

545
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,769
rot and how to educate their crews on it

546
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:32,160
was a really big factor in what I was

547
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:34,799
there to do and I think it was it was a

548
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,509
really educational process I think for a

549
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,879
very great educational experience for

550
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,799
both me and for them just to understand

551
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,840
what they had available to them and what

552
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,539
sort of viticulture techniques they

553
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:49,289
could use when they didn't have the

554
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:53,099
spray management techniques available to

555
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:54,930
them so I want to thank there's so many

556
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,500
people to think but the Frederick dear

557
00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:00,720
award itself as I mentioned before just

558
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,519
such a fantastic opportunity and I

559
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,440
encourage other graduate students to

560
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,089
apply for it as well as the award

561
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,110
committee members kneadable select

562
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:11,069
Mervyn Peretz and Josh Sarah my

563
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:13,259
collaborators at University of Tasmania

564
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:17,579
as well as Tasmanian grape growers and

565
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:19,589
the ones i listed here were the vineyard

566
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:21,240
manager is primarily at these various

567
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:23,009
wineries and vineyards that i worked

568
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,799
with and of course my p.i wayne wilcox

569
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:27,660
for allowing me to spend six months to

570
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,609
go to Tasmania and I feel like I really

571
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,980
brought back a lot of very valuable data

572
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:34,349
that we're going to be able to put right

573
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,690
into paper it so looks looks good for

574
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:38,519
everybody so with that I will take

575
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,420
questions

576
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,829
[Applause]

577
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,019
yeah so the question was are there any

578
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:48,389
viticultural techniques that the farmers

579
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:53,519
are using that our effective against our

580
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:56,550
rot so that was that was tricky because

581
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,109
we think part of the problem was when I

582
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:59,399
went down there originally I didn't even

583
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,579
know if we were going to cease our run

584
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,230
so it was a big question mark up until

585
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,470
the point where I actually saw shower

586
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,200
rod in the singers and so I was kind of

587
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:14,460
observing their practices and seeing if

588
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:18,600
I could point out anything to them but I

589
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:22,170
think what we continually talked about

590
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,169
is how to loosen clusters and so leaf

591
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,670
pulling techniques and any measures that

592
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:29,880
you can do from a viticulture standpoint

593
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,350
to reduce the compactness of clusters

594
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,640
because that's really what does it is

595
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:34,319
when those berries are pushing up

596
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,750
against each other and they're forming

597
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,599
wounds it's an entry point for yeast and

598
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:42,599
bacteria and for fruit flies to let eggs

599
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:46,439
and so kind of reducing that cluster

600
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,779
compaction was a really big deal and so

601
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,140
primarily leaf pulling in the early

602
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:55,769
season I mean that's been the most

603
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,840
effective technique um yeah but you have

604
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:59,279
to be really on top of it you'll be very

605
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,559
vigilant and you'd be pretty dedicated

606
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,220
to it because leaf pulling requires a

607
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,069
crew I mean you can do it with a machine

608
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,990
that a lot of people don't have

609
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:12,450
mechanized leaf colors to just put on to

610
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:15,660
their tractors so it's very expensive

611
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:17,250
either way but it is a technique that

612
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,080
people have used in the past and it's

613
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,680
well researched and there's a lot of

614
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,779
literature about it but that was the

615
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,570
biggest thing that I could recommend to

616
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:30,119
people because there weren't and it was

617
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:31,799
all for next year right so this is we

618
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,789
had it even harder because I well I'm

619
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,789
standing there going well there's

620
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:37,379
nothing really that you can do now

621
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:39,809
except for remove this fruit from your

622
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,840
vineyards but next year

623
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:44,879
about leaf pulling think about really

624
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:49,230
reducing that cluster compaction to the

625
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,510
best of your ability so the question was

626
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:54,569
about thicker thick skin versus thin

627
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:57,019
skin varieties and whether viticulturist

628
00:27:54,569 --> 00:28:00,839
SAR switching to thicker skin varieties

629
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:03,539
to avoid the disease and no not really

630
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,639
so the problem is is that thin skin

631
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:08,789
varieties are primarily grown in cool

632
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,920
climate viticulture areas because of the

633
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,539
ripening issue that you need to get the

634
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,210
fruit rice and thicker skin varieties or

635
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:18,119
more they take longer to ripen and so

636
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,490
it's kind of a you're in a tight spot

637
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,869
where you can't pick switch so much to

638
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,890
the thicker skin varieties because

639
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:25,739
they're going to be more difficult to

640
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,980
ripen so no we're not really seeing that

641
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:33,599
I think some people are at least here in

642
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:37,500
the Finger Lakes Pinot Noir is a

643
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:39,990
difficult grape to grow period it's a

644
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,910
it's it's difficult and it has trouble

645
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,190
right thing here and then on top of it

646
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,200
it is very susceptible sour rot so in

647
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,640
talking to several growers in the area I

648
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,980
know that some people are just they've

649
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,960
had it with with you know my kids one of

650
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,950
those things where they're they're not

651
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,529
going to go through the trouble of

652
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,529
growing it anymore to then have it you

653
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:00,000
know get sour rot a week before harvest

654
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,589
and then not even be able to harvest at

655
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,380
all so there's there's conversations

656
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:07,619
going on but at a very small kind of

657
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,050
micro level at this point yeah switching

658
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,819
and then also from from a little

659
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:15,359
cultural standpoint re grafting your

660
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:17,539
vines is a huge costly undertaking and

661
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,919
so most people don't have that option

662
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:24,029
it's more just managing the vine so you

663
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,890
already have yeah yeah so the question

664
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,690
was whether I have guesses as to the

665
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:33,930
sequence of events of yeast bacteria

666
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:38,160
drosophila as I drop my microphone so

667
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:40,710
yes we do have guesses so we have found

668
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,870
yeast on the surface of the grapes from

669
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,549
a very early point in the season and I

670
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:47,399
think that's the it's a generally

671
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:49,259
accepted idea in the wine industry that

672
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,480
there is East that is coming in on the

673
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,069
surface of grapes the question is where

674
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,940
is the acetic acid coming from thus

675
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:59,909
forming the vinegar and so yeah the

676
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,680
alumina is that's kind of the role there

677
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,140
is trying to address where this bacteria

678
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,570
is coming from we know that fruit flies

679
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,390
themselves they eat yeast they eat

680
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:12,299
acetic acid bacteria so it's on their

681
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,340
bodies so they are they could be

682
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:16,589
vectoring it right they could they could

683
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,349
be the instigators but it could also

684
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:22,169
just be on the surface of the grape

685
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:25,289
itself and there could be something to

686
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:27,779
do with the Flies something to do with

687
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:32,519
an enzyme that could be speeding up the

688
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:34,289
process or as they liquefy the pulp of

689
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,049
the crepe perhaps that's helping to

690
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:39,259
speed along the process and so yeah that

691
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:42,629
is sort of the that is the big question

692
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:44,430
that still has left we have to we have

693
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,670
to address before I can be done with my

694
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:49,019
PhD is sort of what is the sequence

695
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:52,019
because that's everybody's question and

696
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:55,549
it's my question too so we're getting

697
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,549
there yeah I hope to know

698
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:01,749
yeah so the question was whether the

699
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:03,519
sort of epiphytic microorganisms change

700
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:06,879
from vineyard to vineyard in different

701
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,700
regions and so that's the role that's

702
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:13,089
kind of what the Illumina sequencing the

703
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,769
aim of that that's basically that's the

704
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:17,048
name of that side of the project is to

705
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:18,579
understand whether it it changes not

706
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:21,190
only over the course of the season but

707
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:23,648
from site to site I mean the whole idea

708
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:28,720
of terroir in winemaking is that every

709
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:30,758
single site it that's what affects the

710
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,460
wine quality and the wines that are

711
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:36,159
produced out of there so one would think

712
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,690
that that would you know be affected by

713
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,559
the microorganisms that were specific to

714
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,980
that site so far we see a lot of the

715
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:46,898
same yeast at every site you know

716
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,710
there's there's like a top-five yeast

717
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:52,959
and that we see everywhere the questions

718
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,639
are whether they change in quantity and

719
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,889
how those are affected by different

720
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,209
environmental conditions and over the

721
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:00,128
course of season so I'm really hoping

722
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,879
that that that paper is going to address

723
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:05,408
some of that yeah oh so the question is

724
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:09,388
whether there's an epicenter for wheres

725
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:11,799
our rod originated and no I don't think

726
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:14,648
because it's not I'm not dealing with a

727
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,808
traditional pathogen I don't work with

728
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:18,128
you know one a causal organism that is

729
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:19,749
traditionally considered a plant

730
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:21,219
pathogen we're dealing with yeast and

731
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:23,440
bacteria which is just in the

732
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,118
environment so I think instead of there

733
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,609
being an epicenter of the disease it's

734
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:30,608
more like the environmental conditions

735
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:33,308
that give rise to the disease so it's

736
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:35,428
it's more of a question of water you

737
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:37,778
know obviously cool climate viticulture

738
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,960
with Center spins and varieties and

739
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:44,769
where there might be more humidity or

740
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,470
higher humidity and of rains near

741
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:48,849
harvest that's where you're going to see

742
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,239
more sour out because those are the

743
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:53,379
conditions that give rise yeah exactly

744
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:55,210
that are can do

745
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,530
to sour on as opposed to boost their

746
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,819
being an origin of the disease yeah yeah

747
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,660
it's a great question so the question

748
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:06,549
was about whether was you know before I

749
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,140
went the disease wasn't on a lot of

750
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,349
people's radars and so now that I'm not

751
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,910
there anymore what what things are in

752
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:16,209
place to help growers going to manage

753
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:18,340
this disease or or talk about it there

754
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,759
isn't a lot there is no extension system

755
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:23,859
like we have here I mean the the

756
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,299
researchers work with growers but

757
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:27,879
there's no formal system where they have

758
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:29,980
an appointment to go and you know they

759
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,070
have to spend X amount of time out there

760
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:37,110
talking to growers there is a active

761
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:39,159
grower community they are interested in

762
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:41,259
they're interested in learning and they

763
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,930
talk to each other a lot amongst each

764
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:46,240
other but there isn't anything no formal

765
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,700
structure available to them to meet up

766
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,690
and and how these conversations I think

767
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,190
a lot of a lot of growers that I worked

768
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,480
with just said well we've never seen

769
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:58,390
this before it'll probably never happen

770
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,130
again and I'm going like oh gosh well I

771
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,950
really hope I didn't personally caused

772
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:06,700
our rot for the only year that I happen

773
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,740
to be there but uh yeah I'm hoping that

774
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,878
it'll just be I think it'll just be

775
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,619
something that happens naturally over

776
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:13,360
time that the growers are going to have

777
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,829
to have those conversations because it's

778
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,039
the problem isn't going to go away this

779
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:19,989
is it I can guarantee it wasn't a fluke

780
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:23,769
and I think it's just going to have to

781
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:26,168
happen between themselves but because

782
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:28,570
there are so there aren't any tools for

783
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,619
them to use in terms of insecticide

784
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,649
spray which is going to be the most

785
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:33,460
effective tool that they can use so

786
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:34,960
people are going to have to get creative

787
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,280
but no there's not a formal structure

788
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:49,720
for allowing that to happen which is

789
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:51,760
really it's really unfortunate yeah this

790
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:56,638
has been a production of Cornell

791
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,639
University on the web at cornell edu
