1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,720
University thank you very much

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,490
Don and Meena for the very nice

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:13,859
introduction and I'm a big story for my

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,109
rusty English but if you complain about

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,448
my English is that because I learned my

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,760
English here in Ithaca so that's why

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,380
because when I came here Nina

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,060
didn't say that but when I came here I

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,879
didn't know almost any English so I

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,309
learned something keep on studying keep

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,198
on talking and and then I you know I

13
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,820
practice it for a long time but now it's

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,380
it's a little bit you know rusty but

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,909
anyway I hope you will understand what

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,879
I'm saying

17
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:43,738
I asked me not to give a seminar to

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:47,070
telling about the borinage and urban

19
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:50,759
forest research in Italy especially the

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,070
research that my group is coming out and

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,218
but I would like to give you an overview

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,480
of the research funds all over Europe

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,640
and in Italy Nina has just introduced me

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,558
I teach her body cash on urban forestry

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,989
ornamental horticulture green areas

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,938
planting and management and then

27
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,039
methodologies and tools to mitigate

28
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,548
climate change effects in the urban

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,219
environment also being the Dean so it's

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,830
quite hard time for me to deal with all

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,868
these things I've been in the board of

32
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,929
directors may I say for several years

33
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:27,019
and these are my research interests but

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,060
you will see some example of our

35
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:31,500
research in the last year first part I

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,228
would like to give you an introduction

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,938
of the School of Agriculture of the

38
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,340
University of Florence this is the

39
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,519
building is a very old one it dates back

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,420
to the late seventeen hundreds and my

41
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,819
office is actually here and it's the

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,879
office of the Grand Duke of Tuscany so

43
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,938
it's a very nice office with a lot of

44
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,069
frescoes but its frescoes it means it's

45
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,279
very cold in winter and very hot in

46
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,258
summer maybe the Grand Duke had some

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,739
systems to you know to adjust the

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,750
temperature

49
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,179
but anyway it's very cold but it's

50
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,950
located in the main park of Florence

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,110
about 80 hectares

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,699
so it's about 168 acres maybe 200 acres

53
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,570
something like that

54
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:22,859
full of very old trees pine trees oak mt

55
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,659
dia Planetree and so on and I'm coming

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,830
to the Dean of the school the school the

57
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:32,099
cultural diversity of Florence is formed

58
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,750
by two main department my department

59
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,000
department of agriculture and

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,830
environmental sciences and then the

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,009
Department of Agriculture Food and

62
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,330
forestry systems my department is mainly

63
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:48,209
focused on you know agriculture

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,810
chemistry I mean plant physiology and

65
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,239
and so on and the other one is mainly

66
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,610
related to forestry and then we have a

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,140
third sorry the third department which

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,560
is the Department of Chemistry we have a

69
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:04,619
lot of chemistry teachers in our school

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,310
so we we take direct them that them

71
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,989
directly from the Dartmouth chemistry at

72
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:16,379
present we are 27 full professor 52

73
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:23,819
associate professor and 38 researcher

74
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:25,919
total of 117 faculty position in in the

75
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,959
school actually this is just the main

76
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,000
bill that we have several different

77
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,379
buildings one is much more more than

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,709
much we have seven bachelor degree

79
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:41,219
courses which for us is three years but

80
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,349
two years like like you're like yours

81
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,569
I'm cultural scientists forestry and

82
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,729
environmental sciences nursery crop

83
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,889
sciences Food Sciences and Technology

84
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,139
wide life sciences we have a lot of

85
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,429
wildlife in Italy then we have

86
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,250
viticulture and only is it very

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,189
important for our region you know we

88
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,189
produce probably the best wines and in

89
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,539
the world together with French people

90
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:06,299
but we don't like to see that just to

91
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,759
say that but anyway and then we have a

92
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,040
new class a new course from this year

93
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,879
about wood technology which is another

94
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:19,009
important topic for my country then we

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,108
have six master degree courses two years

96
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,310
science and agriculture technology

97
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:26,399
tropical rural development which is in

98
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,240
English it's dedicated to people who

99
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,599
come

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:35,650
Africa South America Southeast Asia

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,860
country which are you know known for a

102
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:41,949
very tropical subtropical or equatorial

103
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,129
climate then we in science in technology

104
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,360
forestry system food technology science

105
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,120
and management of white life

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,240
environmental resources and then a new

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,160
one starting this year biotechnology for

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,930
Environment Management and sustainable

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,480
agriculture which is mostly in English

110
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,790
meaning that we have a few classes in

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,790
each other which slides in English and

112
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,560
most of the classes are taught in

113
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:11,110
English now we had to PhD programs first

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,060
one I was him I mean world involved in

115
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,069
agriculture and environmental sciences

116
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,060
and the second sustainable management of

117
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:23,019
agriculture researchers forestry and

118
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:26,019
food we have two facilities two main

119
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:29,289
facilities one is located in the Chianti

120
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:32,949
area it's a very old you know

121
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,900
farm dated back to the 12th century it's

122
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:38,529
very nice it's located in one of the

123
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:42,939
most beautiful places of our region and

124
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:46,089
here we produce mainly wine and olive

125
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:49,329
oil some cereals and fruit trees but

126
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:52,179
mainly wine and olive oil

127
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:56,019
and it's very nice it's old it doesn't

128
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,990
look very modern but it's it has it also

129
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:00,819
a very high importance in terms of

130
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,560
history and now we have another

131
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,769
facilities up in the mountains for

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,740
forestry studies still very old dating

133
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:12,279
back to the 1700s and there we can host

134
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,500
up to I guess forty students at the same

135
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,389
time they can sleep there they can eat

136
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,579
air we have all the facilities and they

137
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:25,810
have lots of forests around to study

138
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:29,680
forestry and wood technology so the

139
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,829
second part is dedicated to an Italian

140
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,160
perspective on research I would I should

141
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:38,990
say actually European perspective and

142
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,900
research because

143
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:47,060
most of our research money now comes

144
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:51,299
from Europe from the European Union I

145
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,759
have chosen a cop down approach starting

146
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,340
from the highest level of funding to the

147
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,110
lowest level of funding doesn't mean in

148
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,869
terms of money there is a difference but

149
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:06,090
in terms of you know the overall

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:09,689
structure so most of the money the real

151
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,698
money now comes from the program horizon

152
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:15,360
2020 and only if you are familiar with

153
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:18,240
this program it's a program that it's

154
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,788
inside the EU framework and it's a

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,439
program from research and emulation it's

156
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:27,120
started in 2014 and it will finish in

157
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:30,539
2020 but the research will finish you

158
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,288
know all the calls will be until 2020

159
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:36,498
but research will finish in 2023 24 it

160
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:42,588
depends on which kind of probably apply

161
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:45,750
for for example this is an example of a

162
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:47,370
research project which was funded by

163
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,800
European Union it's about green

164
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,870
infrastructure and urban biodiversity

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,319
for sustainable development and green

166
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,348
economy it has just finished it was

167
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:02,520
inside the 7th Framework Programme so

168
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:04,668
before horizon 2020 by finished last

169
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:09,889
year we had this huge conference in

170
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:12,568
Oviatt about this topic I'm sorry and

171
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,269
you know all the city which were

172
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:19,468
involved in the race you can see the

173
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:21,508
point in all of Europe and to in and in

174
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:24,149
each other in Milan and body were

175
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:27,689
involved in this huge problem which

176
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:31,069
produced a lot of publication and the

177
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:35,550
book which is called the urban forest

178
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:38,879
then there is another problem life plus

179
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:42,328
program it's different it doesn't fund

180
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,038
research it does fund project for

181
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:49,888
example just to give you a short example

182
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:51,928
you wanna if I'm in Florence I want you

183
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:55,818
change the layout of the parking lot a

184
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:58,438
huge parking lot transforming it from

185
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:01,409
the old-fashioned parking lot with you

186
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:03,958
know impermeable payment I want to

187
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:06,958
transform in a very sustainable parking

188
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,909
lot so I can ask for money to the

189
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,789
European Union I have to present a

190
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:15,178
project but it doesn't fund research so

191
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:17,009
that the word research shouldn't be

192
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:20,458
mentioned in any part you can do

193
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:25,528
research but nobody should should know

194
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:30,208
but anyway it started in 2014

195
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:35,600
horizon 2020 for example we we applied

196
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:39,498
to life last September October sorry

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,949
this cold life climate change adaptation

198
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:46,619
and we submitted this project which is

199
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:48,628
the innovative technology platform to

200
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:51,839
improve management of green areas for

201
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:54,089
better climate adaptation and thanks God

202
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,860
three weeks ago we you got a note from

203
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,429
European unit that this project was

204
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:03,119
funded with 2 millions euro something

205
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:04,708
and I personally got two hundred twenty

206
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:07,319
thousand euro for three years which is a

207
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:09,568
huge amount of money compared to usual

208
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:12,178
there's a lot of work to do we have to

209
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:15,659
monitor plants and you know any kind of

210
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:18,558
stuff for three years but anyway it was

211
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:22,708
very good to get bad news

212
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:25,948
why is that until probably 10 years ago

213
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:30,058
it was very hard to have from European

214
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:33,178
Union project about abort catch an urban

215
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:35,818
forestry landscape planning and strong

216
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:39,269
funded by European Union but things

217
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:46,198
changed and now there the European Union

218
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:48,989
is very sensitive to fun also this kind

219
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:51,358
of research they have this green

220
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:53,999
infrastructure program and they also

221
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:56,459
have this nature based solution every

222
00:10:53,999 --> 00:11:01,709
nature and series programs so you can

223
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:04,199
apply for two coats there are two costs

224
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,479
every year so one is in

225
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,270
February the other one is early

226
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,420
September or the end of September it

227
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,509
depends and you can apply with for these

228
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:18,629
two different codes and I mean the

229
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:22,980
percentage of projects funded is less

230
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:25,379
than 10% which is know very low but

231
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,620
there is a there are a lot of calls

232
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:31,350
along say seven years so to cause

233
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,379
failure on putting calls so you have to

234
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:40,560
apply apply apply apply them probably

235
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:43,679
you will get some funds a third system

236
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,279
to get some funds not for research but

237
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,589
for networking is the cost action its

238
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,610
European cooperation in science and

239
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:56,000
technology because this acronym and it's

240
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:59,220
for the one of the longest-running

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,549
framework supporting cooperation among

242
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:06,149
scientists and institution researchers

243
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:09,179
across Europe now also researchers from

244
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,610
outside of Europe can participate with

245
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,809
this kind of cooperation

246
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:18,480
it doesn't fund research it does fund

247
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:21,659
exchange between researchers and it does

248
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,970
found a scientific mission short term

249
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:26,549
scientific mission for young researchers

250
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,430
so it's very good for young people who

251
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:32,429
want to have their career in the iboga

252
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:36,359
cottage and urban forestry sector for

253
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:38,069
example this cost action the name the

254
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,230
title of the cost action was green

255
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,690
infrastructure approach linking

256
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,470
environmental with social aspects in

257
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,540
studying and managing urban forests you

258
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:53,370
see that all Europe who was involved

259
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:56,639
except for some countries but also some

260
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:59,279
part of Africa Tunisia and Algeria

261
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,409
guests remember maybe Algeria no sorry

262
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,629
Morocco Morocco and Algeria and then

263
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:07,019
also the United States and Canada

264
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:09,870
because also countries from outside of

265
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:17,240
Europe can participate as a partner in

266
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:17,240
this kind of action yes yes

267
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:23,699
that you mentioned its that also open to

268
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:27,179
North American as a partner you can't

269
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,670
get money but we can get money to invite

270
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:34,859
people from outside of Europe to join

271
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:37,829
the group so you can get funded research

272
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,528
money but you can get funds to come to

273
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:43,860
Europe to give seminars to exchange

274
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:46,439
opinion and so on in this cross-section

275
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,690
there were five working sorry four

276
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,430
working groups first one was

277
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,899
environmental services of green

278
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,299
infrastructure and urban forestry

279
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,190
implications of climate change the

280
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,899
second one was related to social

281
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,760
cultural services of green

282
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,789
infrastructure and urban forestry

283
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,740
third one governance and the fourth one

284
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:08,458
is Task Force on integration and

285
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,039
dissemination and then we have some

286
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:15,479
working groups these are not funded it's

287
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:18,269
just a system to networking with people

288
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,149
all over the world and it's very

289
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,850
interesting the Food and Agriculture

290
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:27,659
Organization now has a strong interest

291
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,500
for the urban forestry last year they

292
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:34,199
developed that poster of flyers in I

293
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,778
don't know how many languages in all

294
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,680
over the world so you can download the

295
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:43,500
poster on your left from the FAO website

296
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,989
and they also produce the guidelines on

297
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,169
urban and peri-urban forests even though

298
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,899
FAO is mainly dedicated to you know food

299
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:57,199
and agriculture now they had a special

300
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:59,909
section on urban and peri-urban forests

301
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,300
there is a working group a part of this

302
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:03,600
working group we meet at least twice a

303
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,299
year

304
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,000
all over Europe last meeting was in

305
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:13,578
Portugal the next one will be Rome at

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,190
the end of April I will remember and

307
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:19,859
they have also a link you can be part a

308
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:23,850
member of this group so you can get

309
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,769
email you can get link update about

310
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,990
Congress conference all over the world

311
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,980
and you can refer to those two persons

312
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,279
who belong to

313
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,750
the FAO in-room they're both I tell em

314
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,059
but they speak a very good English much

315
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,490
better than me also because they they

316
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:45,239
are have half English both so their

317
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,399
parents are party telling start I think

318
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,620
English not America

319
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:55,289
I'm sorry okay I did it and now we have

320
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,769
a national level I don't know if you are

321
00:15:55,289 --> 00:16:00,120
familiar with this project in Milan it's

322
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:05,809
the vertical wood

323
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:08,279
it became probably the most known

324
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:11,399
landscape project all over the world now

325
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,959
they're building skyscraper with

326
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,289
vertical woods all over the world

327
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Germany France the Netherlands China

328
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:21,929
South America and and so on

329
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,160
so it it's called vertical wood it's not

330
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:28,399
a wood anymore sorry it's not anyway but

331
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:31,949
they they grow three up to the 30th

332
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,919
story in this and this building which is

333
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,680
very nice to see I don't know how how

334
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:41,129
much is sustainable but it's very nice

335
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,459
you can you can trust me and so at the

336
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:47,210
national level three years ago we got

337
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,280
some funds from the state for this

338
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,050
problem Tree City for three city

339
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,559
international project for a better

340
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:58,740
quality of life in our cities it

341
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:01,949
involved cities from universities from

342
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,650
all over Italy from Sicily from Rome

343
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,860
from Tuscany from the northeast part of

344
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:13,410
Italy from Milan so and it's finished

345
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:15,509
last year another project funded by the

346
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,750
Minister of Agriculture and forests of

347
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:20,549
by the Minister of University it's about

348
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,150
the role of urban greening on air

349
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:28,889
pollution mitigation just finished all

350
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:31,680
this and then another project we have

351
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:36,690
finished two years ago was this one we

352
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,279
developed a software for evaluating the

353
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,390
effects of species selection and

354
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:45,660
planning on microclimate unfortunately

355
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:48,300
the software is ready it's working

356
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,540
but the ministry hasn't released the

357
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:54,119
permission to you know put it on the

358
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:59,639
market so we are still waiting for for

359
00:17:54,119 --> 00:18:03,649
that and the third part is research of

360
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,860
my group so going down down down we were

361
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:09,930
finally arrived at my department I know

362
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,959
the building is very ugly you know it's

363
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:16,799
its enemy don't know where actually this

364
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,250
picture was I think 15 years know maybe

365
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:24,000
13 years ago so these trees are much

366
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:28,049
bigger now they're turkey oak quite a

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,910
serious yes service the building is ugly

368
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:32,309
but it's very close to Florence you know

369
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,050
Florence I'm Florentin so I'm not the

370
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,349
right person to say something about my

371
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:42,029
city but I know that my city is one of

372
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:44,759
the you know target for tourists every

373
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:48,000
time I go in Florence Monday morning at

374
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,910
7:00 she's the afternoon Wednesday

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,099
morning lunch time always full of

376
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,009
tourists you cannot even walk sometimes

377
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:58,529
along the streets of Florence

378
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:00,750
but anyway coming back to research we

379
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:02,309
have some research projects I will show

380
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,079
you something we have international

381
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:07,019
connection that's why I'm here

382
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,639
and we have some university courses we

383
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,559
are managing plant nursery science

384
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,600
environment and green areas management

385
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,029
and then we have landscape architecture

386
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:19,519
together with the architecture

387
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:22,170
department and then I am um I should

388
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,389
manage this research lab or plant

389
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,400
nursery science environment and green

390
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,380
areas management I should because being

391
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,480
the Dean is quite hard for me to do

392
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:36,210
everything sort of had a person who is

393
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:39,720
actually managing this research lab we

394
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,730
have basic research for example we have

395
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,890
studying response mechanism to multiple

396
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:48,000
environmental stressors in matron and

397
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,670
woody species and we had just looking at

398
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,710
the effects on secondary metabolism we

399
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,180
are working on the evaluation

400
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,509
morphological physiologic and

401
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,490
biochemical properties and parameters

402
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:01,980
related to drought tolerance which

403
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,558
a big issue in in the Mediterranean

404
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,450
Basin you know and it's becoming bigger

405
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,119
and bigger configured either by you

406
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,700
because of climate change and now we're

407
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,919
working on urban trees and volatile

408
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,340
organic compounds addition of some

409
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,740
species typical of the our urban

410
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:23,189
environment and now we have applied

411
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,849
research more basics field research

412
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,279
field research I will refer merely to to

413
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:32,699
these research we have we are doing now

414
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,678
tuning up automated trees we have done

415
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,850
we have finished the root pruning

416
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:41,730
project to simulate Street works we are

417
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:44,399
working the project will we finish in

418
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,890
2021 about the effects of different

419
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,080
paving materials on growth performance

420
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:54,660
and physiology of two widely grown

421
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:57,058
species in in Europe and in Italy and

422
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,679
then we are studied evaluation of the

423
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:00,329
ability of some shrub species to

424
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,690
mitigate the effect the effect of

425
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:08,308
pollution in the urban and peri-urban

426
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:11,640
environment our philosophy is simple

427
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:15,299
research but very deep investigation so

428
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:18,540
we start from the field from

429
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:20,579
morphological characters physiological

430
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,129
characters per a meetings and then we're

431
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:26,308
going we go to the lab and we we have

432
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:30,179
all the analysis possible in our in our

433
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:36,210
lab and in other labs which are

434
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:40,980
connected to my lab first research

435
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:45,750
project we tried to simulate the effect

436
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:49,980
of Street works on two different species

437
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:53,369
which are known to be different in terms

438
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:57,480
of reaction to this kind of stress so we

439
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:59,579
cut the roots on one side both sides and

440
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:04,589
no current to compare the effects of

441
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:06,808
this stress on on tree on tree

442
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:10,649
physiology and tree tree growth

443
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:13,170
especially we wanted to calculate also

444
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:17,280
the consequences of roots events

445
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:20,430
on both theoretical meaning calculated

446
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:24,779
and measured by pulling tests resistant

447
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:29,420
to uprooting we did this research on

448
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:33,960
horse chestnut and on linden European

449
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:37,560
limitary we had 48 plants for each

450
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,069
species which were planned in 2004 and

451
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:44,039
we allow them to grow undisturbed force

452
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:46,619
for five years and then in 2009 we cut

453
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:50,539
the roots on one side both sides and no

454
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:53,669
cutting so these these were the three

455
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:59,039
phases control trenching on one side of

456
00:22:53,670 --> 00:23:02,130
tree mild draweth or miles or my stress

457
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,789
and trench them on both sides of the

458
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:09,210
trees so we excavate a trench which was

459
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:13,159
70 centimeter deep at about 50

460
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:19,829
centimeter so two inch to two feet and

461
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:22,440
1.5 feet large and we measure shoot

462
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:26,909
growth stand by emitted growth and tree

463
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:30,350
- cannabis sites for 3 years we also

464
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:33,630
measure the physiology leaf gas exchange

465
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:35,819
maximal quantum yield of photosystem 2

466
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,180
for the chemistry and then we measure

467
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:42,269
pre-dawn water potential for 3 years

468
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:46,650
between 3 and 5 a.m. so very early in

469
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:51,119
the morning night in in the wood the

470
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:55,250
results results show that even after

471
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:59,789
four years as you can see here trees

472
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:06,049
hadn't recovered from the stress control

473
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:09,509
had much higher growth compared to the

474
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:12,680
single trench excavation and you know

475
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:16,160
double trench trenches excavation and

476
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:20,370
there was also a fictive species Celia

477
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,920
as expected to be was less sensitive

478
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:26,039
compared to horse chestnut which is

479
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,340
known to be very sensitive to this kind

480
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,339
of stress

481
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,640
you see here they should growth even

482
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:36,798
after three years is in histogram you

483
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,890
see difference in terms of shoot growth

484
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,869
and in horse-chestnut that was also

485
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:47,000
different between the two kind of

486
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:51,379
excavation so what was the take a

487
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
message from this research from a

488
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,010
physiological point of view has is

489
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,490
written there root severance on young

490
00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:01,940
trees induce similar effects as a mild

491
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:05,359
water stress characterized by diffusive

492
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:09,320
limitation to photosynthesis recovery is

493
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,689
quite slow for years at least four years

494
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:16,839
from from the from the cutting and

495
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:19,038
Linden was harder than hosted

496
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,138
horse-chestnut was more resistant more

497
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,109
tolerant sorry more tolerant to this

498
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:28,788
stress compared to horse chestnut as

499
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:31,369
expected as it was expected to be the

500
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:33,919
other question was with severe trees

501
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:37,308
stand up we have a problem strong wind

502
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:42,080
in the last year in anything we had some

503
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:44,269
tornadoes which was a word which was

504
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,220
associated to United States or to other

505
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:48,798
part of the world now we have tomatoes

506
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,009
also in Italy so we wanted we wanted to

507
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,460
know if this kind of stress could affect

508
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:58,129
the tree resistant to uprooting and so

509
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,639
we pulled the trees after right after

510
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,639
the stress and then we pulled the trees

511
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:07,308
four years later and you can see that

512
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:10,428
even four years eight later there were

513
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:14,648
differences between the trees which

514
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:19,100
undergone the which were which were cut

515
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:22,069
which which fruit story were cut and the

516
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:25,879
control trees both in Linden and in

517
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:31,250
horse chestnut so after four years trees

518
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:36,409
had not recovered from the stress so the

519
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:40,789
conclusions that this kind of cut induce

520
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:46,160
a chronic mind water stress recovery is

521
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:48,379
and would damaged may be a pretty spos'n

522
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,920
factor for trees to be attacked by other

523
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,010
parasites being both animals like

524
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,500
insects and fungi and bacteria and then

525
00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:00,950
the uprooting resistant was reduced by

526
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,460
excavation as it was expected but what

527
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,910
we did not expect is that the this that

528
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:11,299
blue stress was prolonged for at least

529
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:13,580
five years four years this year almost

530
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:16,190
ten years then growing season from from

531
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:19,309
the cut we will measure again we up to

532
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:22,190
the resistant of the trees by pulling

533
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:24,019
tests the limitation of this study is

534
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,690
mainly due to the fact that trees were

535
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:30,289
white quite you are young so they can

536
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:34,390
react much faster than probably no tree

537
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:37,519
like this plane tree in in Milan so

538
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:41,020
we'll see when the tree will be older we

539
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:43,549
will repeat again the root cutting

540
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:46,369
second experiment I would like to refer

541
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:47,960
to is about the FL different pavements

545
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,210
English here's a ten year study

546
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:04,399
evaluating the effects of soy sitting on

547
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:08,840
newly planted trees so we had four

548
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:14,810
different phases twenty four plots about

549
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:18,319
50 square meters in in surface we plant

550
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:22,039
we realize the the research field in

551
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:28,329
November 2011 and we planted the trees

552
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:30,849
in spring 2012 we had four different

553
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:33,199
paving material actually three

554
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:36,769

00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:46,190
design epoxy resin plus even graded in

558
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:52,490

Ami train - 24 plants the species you

563
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:08,049
see when we planted the trees since 2012

564
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,808
we measure soil moisture soil

565
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:15,808
temperature soil oxygen content content

566
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:20,079
soil co2 efflux we measure should growth

567
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:22,200
DBH leaf gas exchange chlorophyll

568
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:27,089
fluorescence and then freedom and midday

569
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,679
water potential we also measure all the

570
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:32,649
meteorological variables like

571
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,110
temperature humidity and so on because

572
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,090
probably they are affected by the

573
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:41,049
different kind of treatments we left

574
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:43,990
some you know holes in the ground to put

575
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:51,069
our sensors for soy humidity soil

576
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:53,710
respiration and strong results after

577
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:56,019
this is our you know not the final

578
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:59,799
results because the as I said this

579
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:01,869
research will go on until 2021 soil

580
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,619
temperature was always high in the

581
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:08,469
parable treatment as you can see here

582
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:10,689
the the gray the gray bar is the

583
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,750
impermeable treatment the temperature

584
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,058
was always higher even in winter time

585
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,750
see even in winter time the temperature

586
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:23,440
of the the soil was higher underneath

587
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:26,500
the impermeable layer you can see here

588
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,289
maybe this picture is much better than

589
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,599
any kind of data any kind of tables of

590
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:37,359
histogram you see during this no fault

591
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:39,819
the be the plot with asphalt with a

592
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,669
warmer so the the snow at the very

593
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:47,230
beginning didn't stuck on this on this

594
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:49,300
plot while was very mean the control was

595
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,808
the belay was already a couple of

596
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:54,339
centimeters

597
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:56,160
once activated so take-home message

598
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:58,750
[Music]

599
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:02,620
these are the difference among payment

600
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:05,079
types with low trees meaning in the

601
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:06,709
middle of the ADI of the plots where the

602
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:10,609
root system probably

603
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:13,490
hasn't arrived yet so the impervious

604
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:15,619
payment infiltration is very low the

605
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,140
evaporation is very low the water

606
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:21,798
content is slightly below fill capacity

607
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:25,130
and what a candidate 45 centimeter depth

608
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:27,408
is slightly above fill capacity terrible

609
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,539
or loosing control you see that control

610
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:33,620
the infiltration is high evaporation is

611
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:37,190
high water content 20 centimeters 40% of

612
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:40,099
the available water and at 45

613
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:43,009
centimeters at or slightly below field

614
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:45,528
capacity I have to say that in these

615
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:49,640
three years of measurement the rainfall

616
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:53,179
was quite heavy we had a lot of rain in

617
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,990
the first three years complain so

618
00:31:53,179 --> 00:32:00,590
conclusion SOI ceiling induce a three

619
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,569
point three to five warming in a salt 5

620
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:06,918
degrees Celsius warming the soil and

621
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:10,490
this effect is likely due to the

622
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:16,100
impaired evaporation and can mitigate it

623
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:19,909
using porous or terrible pavements we

624
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:24,798
had soil moisture increasing and with

625
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:27,080
soil ceiling and we found that the the

626
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,450
water in the soil was a bowl filled

627
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:32,898
capacity so it's not planted with trees

628
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:36,110
in the middle of the of the plots co2

629
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:38,689
accumulates below imperial payments this

630
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:41,418
can be a problem and also we found that

631
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:44,000
oxygen slightly declines below

632
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:48,770
imperative payments but with this was

633
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:53,808
quite obvious about the effort on trees

634
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:56,690
we found that especially South East was

635
00:32:53,808 --> 00:33:00,859
not affected by different kind of

636
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:06,140
payment white fraxinus showed some kind

637
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:08,839
of my stress especially with the two

638
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,759
kind of payment in Paris and bamboo

639
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:16,889
white porous was pretty similar to to

640
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:20,430
control and

641
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:28,470
should both very similar these sill tees

642
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:33,529
and this is fraxinus okay the conclusion

643
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:35,850
that the planting trees in pave soils is

644
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:38,700
essential for us to maintain

645
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:41,629
evapotranspiration urban areas because

646
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,250
we needed to cool the atmosphere

647
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,920
payments at least in this case and

648
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,529
limited effects on growth and physiology

649
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,840
of newly planted trees but I'm referring

650
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:55,259
to the first three years where now you

651
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:58,199
know a piece ahead and we are going to

652
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:00,869
show probably new results in in a Hughes

653
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:06,289
cell T's is much more tolerant compared

654
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:09,539
to ash to manage this kind of stress and

655
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:11,849
also we have limitation trees are very

656
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:15,320
young so we don't know what will happen

657
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:18,599
in the long term with the impermeable

658
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:24,149
payments but anyway this research thanks

659
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:27,029
to the tree fund will go on until 2020

660
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:29,339
21 so further result would be much

661
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,649
different we have published a research

662
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,769
in environmentally their paper in

663
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:38,609
environmental research about the first

664
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:42,329
full year study and I was surprised to

665
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:44,130
see that some kind of pretty similar

666
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,799
study was published recently in the

667
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:49,490
international journal bio metrology but

668
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,690
they just measured the leaf benefice

669
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:54,299
instead of measuring all these

670
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,460
parameters we have measured so I'm just

671
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,220
surprised to have to see this paper

672
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,760
published with just one parameter visual

673
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:07,949
parameter and it's it's impacted you

674
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:10,140
know it's 2.2 m per factor so I have to

675
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:12,929
thank the tree fund because they give us

676
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:16,379
hundred thousand dollars to do this

677
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:19,710
research we started in 2012 as I said

678
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,930
the the plot was established thanks to

679
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,710
the local government but then we got

680
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:27,750
these funds to go on with research until

681
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,780
2021 and we'll check all these kind of

682
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,900
parameters to see we will

683
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,240
to use ground-penetrating rather

684
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,730
geologic synthesis make waves as bait to

685
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:43,849
check how the root system is distributed

686
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:47,460
underneath the pavement a third and last

687
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:50,579
we started last year topping is on

688
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,970
fashion in Italy I fight every single

689
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:57,299
day again stopping but my fight is

690
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:59,579
useless I am NOT succeeding it in

691
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,220
anything anyway this is not topping this

692
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:07,110
butchering it's not talking you see but

693
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:09,480
anyway are you distinguishing yes yes

694
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,900
plotting is something that you know it's

695
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:17,429
good if it's well done stopping it's

696
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:20,690
always bad and this kind of work is very

697
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:26,219
common in Italy unfortunately and

698
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:28,320
something's very sometimes very bad why

699
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:33,899
people talk trees I don't know I don't

700
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:36,600
know because I don't know I always try

701
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,420
to explain that chopping is dangerous

702
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,480
it's useless is much more expensive that

703
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,829
you have regulatory it arm tree its arms

704
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,500
trees and so on no no success they keep

705
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:52,170
on chopping keep on shopping sometimes

706
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,409
because they don't want to have leaves

707
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:57,539
in the full but I say you still have

708
00:36:55,409 --> 00:37:04,049
leaves even if you talk trees maybe you

709
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:07,889
have more leaves in if you what we will

710
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,970
know about pruning and what what don't

711
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:10,739
we know

712
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:15,989
we have a lot of information taking

713
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:19,229
information but it seems to be a battle

714
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:23,909
against windmills you see it is like you

715
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:26,150
know Sancho Panza in Spain because even

716
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:29,639
though we have a lot of information

717
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:34,380
people keep on telling keep on asking to

718
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:38,369
musicality to top trees so I have the

719
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:41,039
idea why don't we try to show the effect

720
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:43,409
of chopping trees of microclimate

721
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,900
condition and show the people

722
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:50,848
how the microclimate condition can be

723
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:58,369
changed if you chop trees so we we chop

724
00:37:50,849 --> 00:38:01,619
trees last year in February and we have

725
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:04,170
you know all these plots normal pruning

726
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:08,068
chopping normal putting and so on on two

727
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:11,519
species Lindemann Mountain maple a

728
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:14,429
subsea bloodiness and just the first

729
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,969
year we showed we saw some difference

730
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:21,449
you see the the orange bar are the

731
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:23,639
topped plot but and the the green bar

732
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:26,368
are the unpooled pods you see that the

733
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,338
temperature was always hired three to

734
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:32,940
five centigrade higher in the topped

735
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:36,659
plots compared to the UM Crone plus

736
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:39,568
three three years Detroit three degree

737
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:42,019
centigrade on average but in some days

738
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:48,509
the difference was nine eight to nine

739
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:52,608
degrees okay this is the same okay we

740
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,809
have a lone plots just beside the the

741
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:57,150
experimental plots so we also measure

742
00:38:54,809 --> 00:39:00,569
the temperature and the humidity and so

743
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:02,838
on also in that body you see that there

744
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:08,460
was no difference between topped and

745
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:15,389
long and also phenology was affected

746
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:19,349
trees lost their lives before when they

747
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:22,469
were top compared to the unproven about

748
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:25,500
trees and then we have I'm going to

749
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:27,209
finish recent lines of research we are

750
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,798
studying the response mechanism of tree

751
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,760
species of oak to draw to it stress

752
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:38,788
according to climate change

753
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:41,490
and then as I said before is not there

754
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:43,500
now we are studying the secondary

755
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:45,538
metabolism in may trade and evergreen

756
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,048
species with height tolerant to osmotic

757
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:52,170
stress to explore the role of these

758
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:54,798
species as a bio factories because when

759
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,090
they are stressed they produce a lot of

760
00:39:54,798 --> 00:40:00,989
antioxidants which

761
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:03,510
are good also for our health so in using

762
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:07,739
my stress on these species can be very

763
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:10,440
good to extract this compounds from from

764
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:13,949
from these species and to use these

765
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:18,869
compounds in the oncology and in the

766
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:21,480
pharmacology we're still doing research

767
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:24,690
about the air pollution abatement by

768
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:29,099
roadside vegetation barrier working on

769
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:32,990
shrubs evergreen shrubs we are studying

770
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:35,519
the isoprenoids and Fannie propanol in

771
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:40,739
their role in the draw stressed

772
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:44,969
resistance in London plain tree and in

773
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:48,119
European Hut berry and this is the last

774
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:51,959
research we're trying to understand

775
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,559
which are the mechanist in red and green

776
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,650
leaf tree species because it seems that

777
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:02,969
having red species means also to have

778
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:06,840
much more antioxidant oxidants in em and

779
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:12,000
in the leaves so it seems that red leaf

780
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:13,890
species can tolerate drought and life

781
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,230
stress much more than green leaves

782
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:19,019
issues it's just an ipod this is we are

783
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:25,170
starting it seems that our hypothesis is

784
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:27,570
true and we will work on no no we German

785
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,809
no we may pull sorry no a maple red

786
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:33,300
Norway maple Deborah which is half red

787
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:36,269
half green and then I think it's summer

788
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,789
shade just green we have published more

789
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:41,070
than 50 papers in impacted journals out

790
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:43,949
of this and previous Regis research

791
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:46,289
project and just to finish some

792
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:48,839
information if you are interested in AB

793
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:52,550
or occasion urban forestry there will be

794
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:56,390
the World Forum of urban forestry in

795
00:41:52,550 --> 00:42:00,570
Mantua which is in the north of Italy

796
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:03,239
late November 20th on November 1st of

797
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:06,630
December Montreux is a very nice City

798
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:09,359
and the middle of flat land part of

799
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,800
Italy is very story they have a nice

800
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,920
lake just

801
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,400
close to the city the the conference the

802
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,490
Congress is the forum of sorry it's

803
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,570
organized by the FAO together with

804
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:26,189
international facial landscape

805
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:28,650
architects the Politecnico on Milan I

806
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,869
mean the scientific board and there is a

807
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:33,420
call for abstract which will the

808
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,359
deadline is 30th of April if I went man

809
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:39,690
so these are all the objectives of the

810
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:43,710
world forum of urban forestry so any

811
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:48,450
kind of research about Boracay and urban

812
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:51,269
forestry is welcome to this forum is the

813
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:53,730
venue and is the website if you are

814
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:58,289
interested in enjoying the the forum at

815
00:42:53,730 --> 00:43:01,469
late November early December and just to

816
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:03,989
finish last year we publish this broad

817
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:08,309
rich handbook of urban forestry actually

818
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:13,279
Nena has two chapters right and in the

819
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:18,110
book and it probably covers all the

820
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:21,150
topics in the urban forestry and all any

821
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:24,240
single chapter is is written by the most

822
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,849
prominent researchers all over the world

823
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:30,599
so you can find anything everything in

824
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:34,589
this handbook it's a bit expensive but I

825
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:38,460
think there is you know it's it works

826
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:40,740
the money it costs okay that's all folks

827
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,159
if you have some question I'll be happy

828
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:43,159
to answer

829
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,730
you may question problem from Geneva I

830
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:54,230
forget to I forgot to say hello to

831
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,230
people from Geneva

832
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:01,200
once one small question thank you so

833
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,230
much by the way is your presentation

834
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,960
available online or by email

835
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:10,800
I will leave my presentation so I think

836
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,880
it would be online soon okay thank you

837
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,610
so much if you if you need more details

838
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,630
on the research because you know time is

839
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:24,720
sometimes it's short and I gave a

840
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,599
presentation last year was six hours of

841
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:30,209
all the research so I just do some

842
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,769
slides to give an example but anyway if

843
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:34,590
you want to know more you can write to

844
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:36,869
me my address email address I would be

845
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:47,269
very happy to share information research

846
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:47,269
and papers with you welcome don't be shy

847
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,119
native soil was a looming sandy loam

848
00:44:55,409 --> 00:45:02,399
soil so it's local soil with some

849
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,750
skeleton inside so what's the normal

850
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:15,980
soil with a high pH actually was seven

851
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:18,739
point eight something it's the level for

852
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:24,869
Street payment so we followed the load

853
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:35,009
was one point six maybe more it sits in

854
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:38,910
the midst of people always everywhere

855
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:42,119
anywhere anytime I this morning I fought

856
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:44,159
with my mayor I don't live in Florence I

857
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,250
live just outside of Florence and my

858
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,000
mayor I know him very well he can call

859
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,340
me anytime

860
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,429
but last week they chopped some trees

861
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:58,120
and I got very angry very angry so

862
00:45:54,429 --> 00:46:00,669
if you go to I have a Facebook page

863
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,339
which which is called amore cache an

864
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,860
urban forestry by Francesca furring you

865
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,490
can find you know picture you can

866
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,990
believe them

867
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:12,429
you really can't believe in how people

868
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:13,779
you know Mucha trees because there is

869
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:16,719
the difference between pruning and

870
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:19,690
cutting I can cut the tree

871
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:22,869
I cannot prune a tree because you know I

872
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:26,530
need some skills to and also some

873
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:28,769
knowledge to prune the trees cutting and

874
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:32,890
pruning are two different things

875
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:35,110
one more question but anyway if you have

876
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:37,719
questions just write to me I'll be very

877
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:46,120
happy to answer writing is much easier

878
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:50,079
than talking for me so ok yes we one of

879
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:53,969
my target as a Dean when I was elected

880
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:59,759
there was a strong competition just me

881
00:46:53,969 --> 00:47:02,349
so I won and they told me they asked me

882
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:08,320
would you would you like to be the Dean

883
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:11,019
of this fool say wow if there is any

884
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,970
other person who want to be I mean at

885
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:15,789
the public seven is my duty to be the

886
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:19,480
Dean and I was in California got the

887
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:22,360
news I was elected so but anyway one of

888
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,940
the target I put on my list was to have

889
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:27,849
to establish closer connection with

890
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,420
University all over the world this means

891
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:32,860
a lot of trouble anywhere in the world

892
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,849
United States and nicest country but I

893
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:40,030
had traveled to Iran to Afghanistan to

894
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:42,819
Azerbaijan to Jordan to Korea and so on

895
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,760
so anywhere in the world to establish

896
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:48,280
closer connection to exchange students

897
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,380
and also researchers and professors so

898
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,650
if you have an agreement it's much

899
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:56,349
easier for some of us to come here and

900
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:59,410
for some of you also be students to come

901
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:02,319
truly to spend a certain period of times

902
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:04,509
doing research or attending classes or

903
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,030
whatever you want to do in Italy and

904
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,110
Johnny life may be on Saturdays and

905
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:13,030
sunny not only

906
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:15,160
weakness so yes so we have to have a

907
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,610
formal agreement and also we were

908
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,799
talking about to have a double degree

909
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:23,289
which will not be very easy I mean we

910
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,570
can do it but it it takes time I have a

911
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:27,550
double degree so students from Landscape

912
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:31,809
Architecture from Horticulture

913
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:35,140
Department can span here two years maybe

914
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:38,259
six months in Italy taking classes and

915
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:40,359
taking also exams and also the vice

916
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,350
versa so students from Italy can come

917
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,630
here and and the the main problem is the

918
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:50,739
different taxation system if the two

919
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:53,769
universities agree to not to put any

920
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:56,759
more taxes on these students it's quite

921
00:48:53,769 --> 00:49:01,329
easy but for us the taxes is very low so

922
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:03,160
it's the opposite which is if you we can

923
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:05,920
adjust something so for example

924
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:08,349
landscape architecture students can come

925
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:13,150
to Italy to spend six six months or

926
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:14,289
maybe a year if they're interested

927
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,650
specially in historical landscape

928
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:19,269
management and storm our course is

929
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,820
specialised in historical management

930
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:24,969
historical landscape management which is

931
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,590
quite obvious in Italy let me thank you

932
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:33,429
very much for coming here I appreciate
