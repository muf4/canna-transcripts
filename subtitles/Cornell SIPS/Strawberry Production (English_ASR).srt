1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,599
and I have that it is

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,599
101 if the rest of

3
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:22,160
you um want to just try to vote and then

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,159
I'll close these polls

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,759
getting a last minute flurry of people

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,479
signing on that's wonderful hopefully

7
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,479
everyone can

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,039
hear and I do want to introduce myself

9
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,119
um I'm Laura McDermot I work for Cornell

10
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,679
Cooperative Extension in the Capital

11
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:04,000
District region and do um vet and small

12
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:08,478
fruit extension education and I'm

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,118
working for Dr Marvin pritz on the

14
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:15,158
northeast IPM funded webinar um series

15
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,519
that we're putting on with a great deal

16
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,159
of help from invited experts throughout

17
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:24,158
the Northeast region so uh our thanks to

18
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
the Northeast IPM Center for their

19
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,680
funding assistance and to all of the uh

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
research researchers that will be

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,520
hearing hearing from over the next um

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,879
several months and also um my great deal

23
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,438
of thanks go to my colleague Kathy heyen

24
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,199
Reich who is has been instrumental in

25
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:47,559
trying to get the um press releases and

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,240
all the pr out for this series and for

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Dr Marvin pritz guidance in it um so

28
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,359
let's get on with it the first uh

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,039
session that we have scheduled today is

30
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:02,118
alternative strawberry production

31
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:05,320
methods and it features um um two guest

32
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:07,599
speakers uh Kathy gem who's the senior

33
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,239
extension associate associate at

34
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,000
pennstate University Kathy has a

35
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,439
background in vegetable and fruit

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,318
nutrition and has been integral to Berry

37
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,199
and plasticulture research in the state

38
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,639
of Pennsylvania so we're really happy to

39
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,039
have her and I'm actually going to let

40
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:28,199
her begin our um begin our talk here in

41
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,799
just one second and I'm jumping ahead

42
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,238
slightly I want to make sure

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
that everybody sees um these additional

44
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,039
resources that are listed here and those

45
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:41,280
are things that you can uh access by not

46
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,439
clicking on they're not live um links

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,280
but you can cut and paste them into your

48
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,400
browser if you're interested in in any

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,640
any of those resources and it just in

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,080
case people are still not aware of how

51
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:58,238
to do this if you have a question please

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,920
type in this skinny box at the bottom of

53
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,480
the chat and either hit return or hit

54
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,439
send message

55
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,798
arrow and I'm just getting um a little

56
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,079
feedback from Sue that the sound keeps

57
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,920
breaking up I'm sorry Sue I um I wish I

58
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,239
knew how to fix that and hopefully it

59
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,919
it's not breaking up for other

60
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:27,438
folks my audio and I'll give you a ring

61
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:30,639
all right um so let me move now into the

62
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:33,199
classroom and I'm going to introduce

63
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,318
Kathy demek again a senior extension

64
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,359
associate at Penn State University and

65
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,759
I'm going to turn off my um talking and

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,239
give a call and I'm gonna um just turn

67
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,000
this over to Kathy Dem well all right

68
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,480
I'll jump into this um at this point if

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,479
anybody does have questions or anything

70
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,840
um feel free to type them in if we end

71
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,158
up um getting too many questions in and

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,239
it gets um too distracting we may end up

73
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,840
um holding them for the end but for now

74
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,719
I'd say if there's anything that I'm

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,360
talking about that's unclear to you

76
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,400
please feel free to just type something

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,280
in and I'll try to um not get um myself

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,158
too far off track on things all righty

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,918
um what I want to talk about here is

80
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:20,839
Northeastern approaches um that are used

81
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,000
to growing strawberries on plastic now

82
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,119
most of the information does apply to

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,839
Northeastern United States for those who

84
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,399
are um a little west of here um there

85
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,079
were some folks from Ohio for example or

86
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,519
in the midwest um most of what I will

87
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,519
talk about would apply to those

88
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,799
situations as well so we're going to

89
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,758
jump into things here um you know the

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,840
most common reasons we get for why

91
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,038
Growers are interested in growing on

92
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:50,038
plastic um are listed here weed control

93
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,560
is probably the number one reason that

94
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:55,000
people give um when they're growing

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,560
strawberries and matted row production

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,319
um often they just get tired of trying

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
to deal with the weeds and the plastic

98
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,959
helps with that problem

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,000
there are some other advantages there is

100
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,399
um a shorter time to establishment than

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,439
you might have in matted row production

102
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,319
um typically you can plant during the

103
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,439
summer or early fall um and still

104
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,399
harvest the next spring so it cuts off

105
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,600
several months um that um during which

106
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,038
problems might develop typically you'll

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,520
get um better quality fruit primarily in

108
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:27,399
the area of size um but flavor can can

109
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,680
also be excellent with plastic culture

110
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:33,519
berries typically um the fruit will come

111
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,079
in um 2 to 3 weeks

112
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,399
earlier um but that really depends on

113
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,000
your management um that doesn't have to

114
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,478
happen if you're in a frost pocket there

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,120
are some things you can do to um to keep

116
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,639
the fruit from coming in too early a

117
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,000
frost is a concern for you higher

118
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,038
marketable yields um you may not

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,560
necessarily get higher total yields but

120
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:56,000
um if everything is managed well um

121
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,120
hopefully you will get a higher

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,639
percentage of fruit that is marketable

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,519
and your marketable yields will be high

124
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,478
higher than they might be in matted row

125
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,560
but again that's not necessarily true

126
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,918
either um berries will tend to pick

127
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,319
faster um in that if you have larger

128
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:14,318
berries um your labor costs can then go

129
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,960
down um for for berries that are picked

130
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,639
ahead and sold as ready picked and um a

131
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,239
lot of our Growers are getting a higher

132
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,879
price for plasticulture berries because

133
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,639
of the higher

134
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,680
quality now here's the disadvantages um

135
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,639
plastic culter berries are expensive to

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,879
establish if you were using plug plants

137
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,240
which um are the type of plants um for

138
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,759
which um the system was originally

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,280
developed for use with um they're

140
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,199
expensive at about 21 cents per plant um

141
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:48,079
and a plant population of around 15,000

142
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,680
plants per acre um the cost adds up

143
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:54,399
fairly quickly so you can you know spend

144
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,959
$3,000 on Plants Alone um it does help

145
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,839
if you have both Trickle and overhead

146
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,918
irrigation the trickle is a necessity um

147
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,279
overhead overhead irrigation will come

148
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,560
in handy in a couple of situations like

149
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:10,000
for frost control um and then plastic

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,160
mulch there's issues um with the cost

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,720
but also disposal um and and just the

152
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,240
environmental costs of using um a lot of

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,160
plastic can be an issue too the um one

154
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,079
other expense that's fairly large is a

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,039
row cover that can be as much as $1,500

156
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,038
per acre um depending on the road cover

157
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,439
you're using and management in this

158
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:33,759
system is is intense

159
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,000
so um you know there's some some

160
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,560
potential there if you aren't able to

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,319
keep up with what's happening in the

162
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,399
planting um where you can get into a

163
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,319
little bit of trouble and all that puts

164
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:48,198
it together into being a a a high-risk

165
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,120
um type of um situation but um there

166
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,079
also is a potential for high returns if

167
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,000
you can get everything working together

168
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,800
well so plastic culture as it was

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,879
developed for use um in the southeastern

170
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,038
United States um where B basically it

171
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,599
was adapted from production systems used

172
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,120
elsewhere um in that situation um

173
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,959
typically plug plants are used plants

174
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,918
planted during the fall either late

175
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,560
September or early October um in that

176
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,359
situation there really are less times

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,598
for there is less time for problems to

178
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,240
develop typically fumigation will be

179
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,399
used um there will be high raised beds

180
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
that'll warm up quickly U most of the

181
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,959
production is with either Chandler or

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,639
camarosa and it is used as an annual

183
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,918
system when we take it to the north um

184
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,958
typically um we'll need to move that

185
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:42,240
planting time um to be earlier either

186
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,199
into mid or late summer you may use plug

187
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,399
plants you also may use dormant plants

188
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,759
and we'll go into some particulars on

189
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
that Growers may or may not use

190
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:54,039
fumigation um if they can rely on crop

191
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,278
rotation um they may not need need

192
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,159
fumigation typically most of the beds um

193
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,078
that will be made for plasticulture here

194
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,799
are are lower than in the South um most

195
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,679
of the Growers will use um plastic mulch

196
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,639
L and bed raising equipment that they

197
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,199
will also use for vegetable

198
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,559
production and um Chandler still works

199
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,240
really well here but there are um some

200
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,278
other varieties that can be used and

201
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,079
typically Growers may carry plantings

202
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:26,879
over um for a second year so we will go

203
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:28,958
into that um more as well um just in

204
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,879
case um you aren't familiar with plug

205
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,039
plants this is what a tray plug plants

206
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,919
would look like so when I refer to those

207
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,360
you you know what we're talking about

208
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,078
basically they are Runner Tips that are

209
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,360
taken from Plants um rooted in um in

210
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,759
this case a 50 cell tray and then um

211
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,399
it'll be vegetative actively growing

212
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,159
plants that that um are

213
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,120
planted okay so um some of the

214
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,319
modifications we use for using this

215
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,000
system in the northeastern you um us

216
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,440
really depend on understanding how the

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,440
plant grows and responds to the

218
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,640
environment if we understand how the

219
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,480
plant is likely to respond um to

220
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,480
different techniques we might use that

221
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,440
modify the environment then we might

222
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,159
know what to change if um we need to

223
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,600
increase our yields further or just want

224
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,600
to try some different things so first I

225
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
just want to talk real briefly about how

226
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,720
strawberry plants do respond to the

227
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,319
environment um Runners are produced um

228
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,800
during periods when you have long days

229
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,760
and high temperatures um are our typical

230
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,879
summertime conditions

231
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:36,120
and um so what that means is when we

232
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,078
move planting dates up we may run into

233
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,879
some some issues with with Runner

234
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,679
production with having more Runners than

235
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,838
we actually want um under conditions of

236
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,838
cool temperatures and short days like we

237
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,959
have in the fall in the early spring um

238
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,120
you'll have Branch crowns formed on

239
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,278
plants and um those those are basically

240
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,120
you know side branches um on the mother

241
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,799
plant um each of those branch crowns can

242
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,480
produce one or two fruit TR

243
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:05,479
es and so we really dependent on having

244
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,200
those to Hive high yields from a

245
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,680
particular plant and then dur when we

246
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,519
have periods of short days and long

247
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,919
nights um that's when flower buds are

248
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,000
initiated that'll happen in the fall um

249
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,240
and also can happen in the early spring

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,480
as well this is something that isn't

251
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,959
strictly temperature dependent or

252
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,320
strictly day length dependent

253
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:27,518
temperature can affect this as well um

254
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,079
finally how the plant responds um Can

255
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,480
Depend with a car um cultivar and so um

256
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,439
this also explains why some cultivars do

257
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,360
better in some areas of the country and

258
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,120
not so well in

259
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,079
others and so like I mentioned um

260
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,959
modifying any components of the system

261
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,359
will affect how how the plants respond

262
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,159
um and what kind of yields we'll get so

263
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,879
you know in a nutshell when typically we

264
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,039
were using um plastic culture in warm

265
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,919
areas and we' use um plug plants planted

266
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,599
in the fall you'd end up with high

267
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:04,199
yields that would result from having um

268
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,440
numerous Branch crowns formed and um

269
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,560
also once those branch crowns are formed

270
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,839
you'd still have um a fairly long period

271
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,078
for flower butt initiation so you could

272
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,199
get high yields from those individual

273
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,919
plants planted in the plasticulture beds

274
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,078
in matted R production where we were

275
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,879
planting um dormant crowns in the

276
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,198
springtime um our yields are really

277
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,799
dependent on having full beds so you'd

278
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,439
have those Runners and daughter plants

279
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,399
produced during the long days of the

280
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,160
summer and then um flowerbud initiation

281
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,320
taking place on those plans during the

282
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:41,039
fall so even if we got an early fall if

283
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,800
we um just had a short period for flower

284
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,198
but initiation we still had a lot of

285
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,799
plants out there that could could still

286
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,240
give us high yields and all of that

287
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,240
might be you know a bit of an

288
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,480
oversimplification but that's kind of

289
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,120
you know um in general how you know some

290
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,480
of the thing how some of the things work

291
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,198
and um why we need to make some of the

292
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,000
changes we need to make so plastic

293
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:07,240
culture in cooler areas some limitations

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,720
we have we do have a relatively short

295
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,039
fall um a short growing season in

296
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,720
general and then um cold winter

297
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,519
temperatures and we need to modify some

298
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,639
things to deal with all of

299
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,959
these so issues on that short fall

300
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:27,159
season if we are using plug plants one

301
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,838
of um the first uh field studies we had

302
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,759
done was looking at planting date and

303
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,920
that's what we you know often recommend

304
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,120
people do when they're considering um

305
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,599
trying plugs in a plasticulture system

306
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,000
is determine their Optimum um planting

307
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
date for us in central

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,360
Pennsylvania um which at our research

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Farm is hardiness Zone 6A just to give

310
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,639
you an idea of you know where we're

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,958
starting from on this um we needed to

312
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,039
plant our plants by the middle of

313
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,879
August this is an issue because there

314
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,639
just aren't enough plug plants available

315
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,639
early enough to supply the demand for

316
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,039
them um in in northern areas and even

317
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,839
when we thought we would be able to get

318
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,838
pluged plants um we didn't always get

319
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,360
them when we thought we would and so

320
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,399
what that meant was sometimes there

321
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,120
would be delays in planting um that

322
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,120
often frequently happened for Growers

323
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,799
and one thing we found was that for each

324
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,440
two we delay we had in our planting date

325
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,278
we basically cut our yields in half and

326
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,079
so you know that's that's a big problem

327
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,120
to have to deal with because you just

328
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,919
can't get the yields that you need to be

329
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,078
able to pay for the inputs um in that

330
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,319
kind of a

331
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,919
situation so we want to look at some

332
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,519
other alternatives for um what we can do

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:48,519
here okay if you um can't get plug

334
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,278
plants um you can try to root your own

335
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,879
plugs from Runner Tips that you can

336
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:56,838
order from nurseries that sell them even

337
00:14:53,879 --> 00:15:00,720
then you can sometimes run into um

338
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,800
issues where the Nursery's um may not um

339
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,800
have the plants may not go into Runner

340
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,399
production um to the extent that they

341
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,639
need them to um due to just WEA

342
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,519
conditions or you know for some reason

343
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,480
they've had some sort of a failure and

344
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,919
um you just can't still can't get the

345
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,159
tips another option is to use dormant

346
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:22,120
plants that you can plant directly into

347
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:24,399
the um raised beds instead and then a

348
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,879
third option is to basically turn um

349
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,720
dormant plants into plug plants and so

350
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,000
we'll go into each of them just a little

351
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,800
bit Kathy I'm sorry for interrupting but

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,559
there's one question from Paul about

353
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,799
what is a plug plan it sounds like

354
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,838
you're going to talk about that here so

355
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,799
sorry for

356
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,120
interrupting yes um no no I'm glad you

357
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,318
did I I failed to notice that one okay

358
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,120
that is a pluged plant right there and

359
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,759
what that is is um well I'll go into it

360
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,799
a little bit but but basically what you

361
00:15:52,759 --> 00:16:00,600
do is you take a tip off of um off of a

362
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:04,159
a a runner that is um you know on a

363
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,000
mother plant and then you root it into a

364
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,039
medium in a tray and so it'll look like

365
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,759
this little vegetative plant and we'll

366
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,439
go I'm going to flip back forward here

367
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,318
um into how you do that um pretty much

368
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,399
you need a Miss system now I'm not going

369
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:19,719
to go into all the details here because

370
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,240
that could be another you know 10

371
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,319
minutes in itself but um there is I I

372
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,159
I'll call your attention to it right now

373
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,639
I'm down the um small fruit Consortium

374
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,039
down Southeast

375
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,198
us um

376
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:39,519
www.sfr.org

377
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:41,679
um at that site um right there um what

378
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,078
you can you can visit it and there is

379
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:48,879
some information on on producing your um

380
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:51,120
own plug plants um we also had um an

381
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,240
article back in it um in Penn State

382
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,399
small fruit and vegetable G vegetable

383
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,278
and small fruit Gazette back in June

384
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,278
2004 that hopefully you'll be able to

385
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,159
Google or use a search engine for um and

386
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,959
find that article but it does give you

387
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,359
details on how to do this but basically

388
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,480
what what you will do is um either

389
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,240
either get Runner Tips from a nursery um

390
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,160
you may be able to produce your own but

391
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,599
you do want to absolutely make sure that

392
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,679
those plants are clean you don't really

393
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,318
um you know just want them to be grown

394
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,319
something that you've gotten that's you

395
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,000
know from a planting where they're just

396
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,798
running out into the row middle you'd

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,960
like to be able to keep them clean with

398
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:31,960
some sort of um

399
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,558
some sort of way to um keep them clean

400
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,240
perhaps using a landscape fabric or or

401
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,000
plastic um on the ground but what you do

402
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,480
is you will cut the tips um off of off

403
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,759
of the runners um you want to do that

404
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,079
when they're just starting to to unfold

405
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:51,839
their leaves it'll take about 35 days um

406
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,480
from the time you cut those plants um

407
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,480
stick them into a growing medium um

408
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,360
it'll take about 35 time days from the

409
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,480
time you do that until you have

410
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,000
um and until you have um a rooted plant

411
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,759
that you can use um you need to do this

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,640
um like say typically we'll use um trays

413
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,359
that have 50 cells in them you'll want

414
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,880
to use a media that's fairly well

415
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,359
drained you'll need a way to Anchor them

416
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,440
um hair pins work really well actually

417
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,359
for just um holding that little um

418
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,558
Runner tip down you just leave a little

419
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,678
stub on it you anchor them in keep them

420
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,879
under Mist um that you gradually

421
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,919
decrease over the period of about two

422
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:37,840
two weeks um and then um you just let

423
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,840
them harden off um or at least you wean

424
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:43,240
them off of the Mist and then um they're

425
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,839
good to go so um I just just do want to

426
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,038
point out that you do need to make sure

427
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,038
you have a clean source of those and

428
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:52,000
they are fairly um you know like say

429
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,158
fairly easy to root yourself but you do

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,319
need to have the time and some sort of

431
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,280
structure to protect them so you know

432
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:02,720
there are some inputs into doing that

433
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,678
um the second option which is probably

434
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,440
um the

435
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:11,240
best best option um for Northern

436
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,798
production um is to use dormant plants

437
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,120
um there you can plant them anytime from

438
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,200
June through

439
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,519
July and um the issue with that we

440
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
talked about how plants will Runner

441
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,918
during the summer is that once you're on

442
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,120
plastic you do need to remove the

443
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,720
runners during the summertime so they

444
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,279
can go um crawling off of the plastic

445
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,600
stick and root in the row midds where

446
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:38,038
you don't really want them um so that's

447
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:39,519
sort of an an issue um for for them so

448
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,279
you'll need to do that you still have

449
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,960
almost a year till Harvest Time the one

450
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:48,279
thing I do want to point out if you're

451
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:50,720
using dormant plants is that um

452
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:53,440
temperature really has a big effect on

453
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,600
the quality of those plants so if you

454
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,038
get them too early um and you don't have

455
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:00,399
the conditions where you can keep them

456
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:03,200
really cold by really cold we mean 30 or

457
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
31° we don't even want them up around 35

458
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,919
or

459
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,200
36° um because they they basically will

460
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,840
start to use up some of their

461
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,759
carbohydrate reserves um at those higher

462
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:15,000
temperatures so we really want them to

463
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,158
stay at the nursery or in a location

464
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,960
where they're kept cold enough um until

465
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,760
you can actually plant them we've had

466
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,880
some Growers get into trouble where

467
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:28,679
they've lost maybe 50% of the

468
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,320
plants um and and you know they'll just

469
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,840
you know be being in a real trouble at

470
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,759
that point because then they have

471
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:37,158
difficulty getting getting replacement

472
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,158
plans so um we do want to mention that

473
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,280
um there is a planting tool that you can

474
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,080
use and rather than um try to use any

475
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,720
kind of a mechanical planter or anything

476
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:50,079
like that we actually do recommend

477
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,440
planting those um by by hand and um

478
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,759
basically you will use um this tool

479
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,038
which looks almost like a nail Pooler a

480
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,558
metal nail puller that you might use um

481
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,279
to to push the roots down in

482
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,240
um into the soil and that works

483
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,200
surprisingly well what we do is just

484
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,558
poke holes in the plastic first to Mark

485
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,600
where they're going and then use the

486
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:12,720
tool to to push the plant roots down um

487
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,719
into the ground and again if you go to

488
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,798
the

489
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,360
www.sfr.org website there is an article

490
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,319
there where they have photographs um

491
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:25,278
demonstrating how you do this and um

492
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,319
that their um write up is actually for

493
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,759
fresh dug plants which are green plants

494
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,399
that we can't use this far north but um

495
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,240
but but the principle is still the same

496
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,120
and the root system still is very

497
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,640
similar so you know that gives you an

498
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:42,439
idea of of how it works and then if you

499
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,759
can um water them um after planting that

500
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,798
really helps with getting them

501
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,278
established when we've used dormant

502
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,798
plants um you know if if the plants are

503
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:51,720
in good shape to start with and we can

504
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,639
get them watered in we have very good

505
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,278
establishment with them and it's nice to

506
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,799
see the the note from Kip there that um

507
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,400
that he can get good establishment

508
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,440
too so it's you know not just us in our

509
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,720
in our research plots um where can you

510
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,600
get the planting tool I'm not certain

511
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,600
whether Norse Farms I believe Norse

512
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,439
Farms may have it or they may have

513
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,319
instructions on how to how to make one

514
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,759
um I know some of our Growers if you see

515
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,879
what the pictures look like um it's

516
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,158
actually something that is fairly easy

517
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,840
to make yourself and and I actually did

518
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,720
end up using our nail Pooler um which

519
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,879
was about a foot long metal you you know

520
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,319
metal thing with a V Notch um in the end

521
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,640
and it it actually worked pretty well I

522
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,240
was a little concerned I might chop The

523
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,320
Roots off with it at some point um but

524
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,759
anyway um I have seen that boy I'm

525
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,519
trying to think of Indiana Berry there

526
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,960
were a couple places with the nurseries

527
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,480
where I've seen planting tools um

528
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,200
advertised um one other thing I want to

529
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,919
mention on the dormant plants is that um

530
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,278
there is a lot of interest in using

531
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:01,799
apigy there had been research done in

532
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:05,119
Massachusetts and and um ah Marv than um

533
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:08,480
there there was research done in

534
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,399
Maryland Maine and Massachusetts where

535
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,679
they found that apogee did increase the

536
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,080
number of Branch crowns and decreased

537
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,360
Runner production and trials so there is

538
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,960
grower interest in that because it

539
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:23,000
results in in higher higher yields um

540
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,240
but that's not a labeled use yet so I

541
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,798
just want Growers to be aware of that um

542
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,720
we're hoping that in a short per period

543
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,240
of time within the well relatively short

544
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,000
period of time within the next couple

545
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,278
years um that we that label may come

546
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,400
through all righty so dormant plants

547
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:43,240
another Advantage with them is that you

548
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,798
do have a choice of cultivars um a wider

549
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,558
choice of cultivar than you might with

550
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:52,278
plugged plants but I want to point out

551
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:54,879
that not all of the cultivars um that

552
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:58,200
can be used or work well in matted rope

553
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,320
production may work well in um plastic

554
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,960
culture

555
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:05,918
um is there a similar product to apog

556
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:09,278
for organic users not that I am aware of

557
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,640
um to answer that question there

558
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,440
um yeah that's something we may just

559
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,919
need to to hold off on for a while and

560
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,600
you know see if there's some some other

561
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,520
way um of dealing with that for or

562
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,240
organic folks in the future but I would

563
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,639
be surprised if anything um came through

564
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,278
anytime in the near future on that um

565
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,120
let's say c that that work um besides

566
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:35,640
Chandler that our Growers have been

567
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,079
happy with um Wendy LaMore um Wendy's

568
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,960
got a really nice flavor I'm really

569
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,839
impressed with the flavor and the size

570
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,240
on that one Lam More's just done well

571
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,720
for us pretty much in every aspect of

572
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,278
production um size quality disease

573
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,759
resistance the the whole nine yards and

574
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,519
then D select and senica are a couple of

575
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,839
other cultivars Growers are using that

576
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,359
they seem to be happy with ones that

577
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,558
haven't done so well um for us early

578
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,839
glow um all the ones I have listed there

579
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,918
early glow Allstar Ovation van Hanah

580
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,759
Gaia viota um we've had Yi low yields on

581
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,240
those um some of them really kick into

582
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,798
Runner production on the plastic and so

583
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,960
though they might have been a great cul

584
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:18,319
ofar and mted rope production you just

585
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,200
end up with a lot of Runners um in in

586
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,038
plastic culture and not necessarily that

587
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,080
much fruit now one other thing you can

588
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:29,480
do if you have a particular calar that

589
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:32,798
you really like um as as a cultivar in

590
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,519
matted rope production you can um get

591
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,000
dormant plants in that cultivar and try

592
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,599
plugging your own plants just you know

593
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,240
give it a shot see how they do we do

594
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:44,119
have a couple of Growers who are doing

595
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,480
that the real challenge is getting the

596
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:49,038
plants into the cells um they do need to

597
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,759
trim the roots a fair amount um and it's

598
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,359
just you know enough to get them to fit

599
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,640
into to some sort of cells we use larger

600
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,879
cells a 32 cell tray um but the cell

601
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,200
depth can be an issue just get them down

602
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,000
in far enough now the advantages of

603
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,798
doing this is that you do know whether

604
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
your plants are going to survive or not

605
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,759
fairly early on um and so you know

606
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,919
you're just putting plants that that are

607
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:15,000
that are doing well out in the field um

608
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,960
it's easy to keep a close eye on them

609
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,119
it's easy to take Runners off you know

610
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,840
when they're right there um in a

611
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,398
condensed location plus you can treat um

612
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,480
pests but again that does require some

613
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:29,278
some labor and having a structure to

614
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,240
protect them now other approaches other

615
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,679
approaches growers in the Northern or

616
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,038
cooler regions will use I'm holding

617
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,600
their plantings over for a second year

618
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,839
um for a second harvest Year and that

619
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,839
that seems to work quite well you may um

620
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,119
have some decrease in yields and Berry

621
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,359
size but some of that is just related to

622
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,918
management um to keeping the planting

623
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:55,038
disease and insect free um and keeping

624
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:58,120
enough n um nitrogen and water water on

625
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,679
the planting if you do decide to try

626
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:04,719
that that um you'll probably want to use

627
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,759
a heavier plastic we use a 1.25 mil

628
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,919
embossed plastic and that gets us

629
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:12,398
through two years um just fine um you

630
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,960
don't have that much cost involved in

631
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:16,319
keeping them for second year because so

632
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,640
much of your cost is UPF front and

633
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,200
typically what you'll do if you want to

634
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,200
do that is mow them after Fring um we

635
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,240
don't we do recommend that Growers don't

636
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,960
try for a third Harvest year um

637
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,599
frequently folks will get through their

638
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,720
second year and think that plants look

639
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,359
prettyy good

640
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,640
but they almost always get into trouble

641
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,759
during that third year and um I'll

642
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,278
explain to you a little bit why we

643
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,919
sometimes have yield decreases in the

644
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,839
second year and why we definitely will

645
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,840
have yield decreases in the third year

646
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,558
um if you look at um how a strawberry

647
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,480
plant grows okay the crown area is

648
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:54,558
basically a compressed stem and you will

649
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:58,558
have new Roots growing right out of um

650
00:27:54,558 --> 00:28:00,200
this area right where um the the the

651
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,200
crown area so you'll see some of these

652
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,360
new roots that are coming out higher and

653
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,399
higher on the crown as as time goes by

654
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:11,678
um as new leaves are produced this stem

655
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:14,879
will become longer um and taller and so

656
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,640
what happens is as it gets higher as the

657
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,760
plant basically gets higher out of the

658
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,200
ground um you do end up with more

659
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,640
problems with winter

660
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,399
injury and then besides that we often

661
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,679
end up with um some problems with um

662
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:31,518
insect and disease these build up um you

663
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,960
may end up with additional Branch crowns

664
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,000
and some smaller berries on them but

665
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,278
again if you keep the nutrition up there

666
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,759
um you know you that yield decreases

667
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,398
into a definite in the second year now a

668
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,158
couple questions can you wait till the

669
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,038
plants go dormant in the fall and snip

670
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,039
off Runners

671
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:51,278
um and start them in the spring I would

672
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:54,440
think that would be a little difficult

673
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:56,359
to do um you could you could give it a

674
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,919
try but I really doubt that the plants

675
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:02,199
would would go that long

676
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,519
um because if the plants are dormant in

677
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,600
the

678
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,960
fall you're still going to have a fairly

679
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:10,398
vegetative you know Runner there and I

680
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,880
really think it'd be a little difficult

681
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:15,278
to keep them in good enough shape um in

682
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,000
until the springtime even even a period

683
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,839
of three or four months I think might be

684
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,200
a little difficult to do Marv um if you

685
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,359
can um if you would care to wave weigh

686
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,200
in on any thoughts on that one i' I'd

687
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,918
appreciate your thoughts there and yes

688
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,798
um Richard's comment went on Oriental

689
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,240
Beetle that seems to be more of a

690
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,839
problem the further east you go we've

691
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,839
also had some problems with strawberry

692
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:41,119
root warm is one where we've had an

693
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:42,359
issue with um in in um carrying

694
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,398
plantings

695
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:47,519
over so all righty um one other thing

696
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:51,158
rowers will ask about um typically

697
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,440
you'll put on a fall row cover um if you

698
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,880
do decide to go with um fall um with

699
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,720
fall planted or well late summer or

700
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,880
early fall planted plug plants um and

701
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,759
you are delayed um you know what do you

702
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,440
do in that situation it is possible to

703
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:11,960
put a fall row cover on um fairly

704
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,679
early um typically we will say that um

705
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,200
you'll apply a row cover when the

706
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,240
temperatures when the high temperatures

707
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,159
for a day or they are either in the high

708
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,359
60s or low 70s day after day you can

709
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:26,559
move that up by a few weeks um and and

710
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,918
try to get a little more growth on the

711
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,038
plants um and

712
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:35,720
adjust

713
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:37,440
so yeah so Marv's comment um dig them in

714
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,960
the fall and plant them in the spring

715
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:44,840
that that may be um you know basically

716
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,960
the Runner Tips just just may not be the

717
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,639
way you would want to go on that um but

718
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,440
dormant plants um might be a be a way to

719
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,600
go there so thank you Marv um fall BR

720
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,759
cover

721
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,038
application um just coming back to that

722
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,480
if you do put it on early and I mean by

723
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,319
uh 2 to 3 weeks um ahead of when you

724
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,319
normally would expect your temperatures

725
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,720
to your daytime highs to be in the high

726
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,278
60s or low 70s um if you put the rad

727
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,120
covers on two to three weeks ahead of

728
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:15,240
that you can make ups for some of the

729
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,719
yield loss by um planting the plants or

730
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,399
plug plants slate but um you just never

731
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,120
make make back the old Bloss

732
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,479
completely one other thing I want to

733
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,959
point out is if you do that for some

734
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,200
reason it does advance the spring

735
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,440
harvest season and that could be either

736
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,679
good um or bad there's just this

737
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,759
carryover effect from putting row cover

738
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,240
on in September that carries over and

739
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,960
makes the plants actually Bloom um

740
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,399
earlier in the springtime and that's

741
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,159
that was something that surprised us a

742
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,319
little bit I also just want to throw out

743
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:47,720
the possibility um of growing day

744
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,879
neutrals on plastic just because um

745
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,600
we've been doing work with them for

746
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,278
about the last three years and they seem

747
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,759
to really really work well on plastic um

748
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,679
Seascape in

749
00:31:54,759 --> 00:32:00,240
particular um and so you know if you do

750
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,200
have an interest in growing day neutrals

751
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,519
or and you think you have a market for

752
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,440
them um for offseason berries um you

753
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,638
know definitely the neutrals work as

754
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,360
well so this isn't a system that's only

755
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:16,798
for June Bears um J neutrals the

756
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,879
neutrals also work well in tunnels and

757
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:22,158
um which Lewis will be talking about in

758
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,120
a in a little while so um R protection

759
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,679
I'd mentioned are cold temperatures um

760
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:31,359
choices you can hope for a consistent

761
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:33,000
Rover that may not um may not do this um

762
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,558
and it looks like there there are some

763
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,480
folks who are growing the um the day

764
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:41,558
neutrals I want to take a couple

765
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,159
questions here um you know our market

766
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,000
for day neutrals really seems to vary

767
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,399
with who is growing them and where they

768
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,159
are located um some people have had you

769
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:54,199
know have been able to sell everything

770
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,440
they can produce others um you know are

771
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,840
having trouble moving them so just seems

772
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,840
to depend on the situation

773
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,360
yes the um for de neutrals we actually

774
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,479
are planting the plants in the

775
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,439
springtime and with what we ended up

776
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,159
doing was using dormant plants we

777
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,960
plugged them ourselves in April planted

778
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,919
them um in May and then could get good

779
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,798
yields off of them for that first summer

780
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,240
and then um we would carry them over for

781
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,759
a second year and get the production off

782
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,440
for the following Springtime after that

783
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:32,798
the size just decreased too much to

784
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,519
really um be happy with with the um just

785
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,398
the production after that point we're

786
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:38,000
just getting a lot of small berries when

787
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,319
we were getting into the second half of

788
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,638
our second year on

789
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,960
plastic okay coming back to our plastic

790
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:46,798
culture the winter protection um you do

791
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,399
want to use row covers if you're in a

792
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:53,519
fairly warm area meaning um you know

793
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,959
hardiness Zone 6A 6B or or slightly

794
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,519
warmer than that if you get into cooler

795
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,120
areas um it seem seems that straw does

796
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,839
does help a lot with getting the plants

797
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,959
through the winter just putting straw on

798
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:10,119
top alone hasn't worked that well for us

799
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,519
um it seems to work for some other folks

800
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:13,919
we've just had difficulty with it

801
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,440
blowing off and maybe it's just our our

802
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,679
lack of consistent snow cover um to hold

803
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,440
it down and and the fact that we have a

804
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,760
windy site where our research plannings

805
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,599
are what's worked better for us is using

806
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,720
straw underneath a row cover I do want

807
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,559
to point out that when you put straw on

808
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,239
the plasticulture planting at that point

809
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,039
you don't really get any you know light

810
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:36,598
into the plant anymore um pretty much it

811
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:40,199
you know brings any plant activity to a

812
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,838
halt there but um we'll put the straw on

813
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,439
later than we would on a matted rope

814
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,519
planting normally we will pull our rope

815
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,079
covers on during the fall to get that

816
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,759
get some increased temperatures and

817
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,440
plant growth during the fall and that

818
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,879
raises the soil temperatures and so it's

819
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,358
going to be later that the plants are

820
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,639
going dormant so we are actually have

821
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,358
always been very close to Christmas by

822
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,078
the time we put our straw on um so we're

823
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:08,759
really talking the end of

824
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:11,000
December to do that and um so what we

825
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,920
will end up doing is actually putting

826
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,199
the row cover on for the fall pulling it

827
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,480
off putting the straw down and then

828
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,000
pulling the row cover back over again

829
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,679
and you do want the plants to be fully

830
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,480
dormant when you do this so they should

831
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,759
you know have that reddish color to them

832
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,480
be a bit flattened um under the neath

833
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,320
the row cover before you do that

834
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,838
okay so the other issue um Frost

835
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,720
protection and that's not just a

836
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:36,199
northern thing that's that's anywhere

837
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,399
it's a problem everywhere but what's

838
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,159
really worked well for us is either

839
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,400
using overhead irrigation um and we'll

840
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,440
actually put the irrigation um

841
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,400
sprinklers on over um top here you can

842
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,000
see one of the lines I think right down

843
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,800
through there um over top of the row

844
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,639
cover and the advantage of this is you

845
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,480
can use the row cover for a lot of the

846
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,598
flas protection um and it's only really

847
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,519
once the temperature reaches close to

848
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,760
freezing underneath the row cover that

849
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,159
you need to turn on the overhead

850
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,640
irrigation so that's cut the amount of

851
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,118
overhead irrigation we need um to about

852
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,078
half of what would need if we didn't

853
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:15,039
have the row cover and um you can also

854
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,519
use a double layer of row cover that's

855
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,199
what I've gone to the last few years uh

856
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,239
our thickness on the straw layer um you

857
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,519
want that to be same as in a matted row

858
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:28,078
planting about four to six inches of of

859
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:30,000
fluffed straw over top of the over top

860
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,560
of the

861
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
plants so let's see we're going to move

862
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,480
on so what are our options for making

863
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,960
plasticulture work um in the northeast

864
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,280
or cooler regions using um plug plants

865
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,318
if they're available certainly is good

866
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,720
if you can get them early enough but you

867
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,079
know like I say there are some issues

868
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:50,480
with that um dormant plants is the other

869
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,240
option carrying them over for a second

870
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,559
harvest year seems to work well

871
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:57,679
consistently um and then you you can

872
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,838
also do plasticulture in high tunnels

873
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,639
but there you get into more costs and

874
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,159
we'll let Louis get into um to that a

875
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,920
little bit so I just want to do

876
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:10,639
basically a A Brief Review of what um we

877
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,760
would what we do um and some of the

878
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,960
things that we've talked about to to get

879
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,800
a plasticulture planning to work um in

880
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,720
some cooler areas you know you'll start

881
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,440
out with your field you do the soil test

882
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,519
do all the things you would for any

883
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,880
planting um except we'll normally work

884
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,119
in about 60 lbs of nitrogen per acre

885
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,800
which is a little higher than what we

886
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,318
recommend for matted row production make

887
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,560
our raised beds in Spring early summer

888
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,119
sometime um ahead of time so that you

889
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,639
have those ready to

890
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,640
go and then plant dormant plants um Mid

891
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,199
July works well for us you need to

892
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:46,799
adjust um that for other regions the

893
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,000
further north you go um seems to you

894
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,680
seem to need to go a little earlier

895
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,440
further south you can go a little later

896
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,799
um or use plug plants um and you can use

897
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,720
those from either tips um that you root

898
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,599
yourself or from dormant plants in mid

899
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,799
August or tips that if you can get them

900
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,039
from a nursery um go through um removing

901
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,880
Runners keeping the planting water um

902
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:11,000
apply rad covers in the fall once

903
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,800
temperatures um your highs get um you

904
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,760
know not out of the low

905
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,200
70s um apply straw mulch um um to get

906
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,800
them through the winter in addition to

907
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,799
the rad covers and then in the

908
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,880
springtime you'll take the straw when

909
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,760
your soil temperature is right around

910
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,720
40° same time um base not same time same

911
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
stage of plant growth as you might have

912
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:33,000
um in a matted rope planting just if you

913
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,159
start to see the plant starting to grow

914
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,639
it's time to take the straw

915
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,480
off and then you leave your row cover

916
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,118
there you can pull the row cover back on

917
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,318
if you want to advance Harvest you can

918
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,358
leave row cover off if you want to delay

919
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:48,599
your Harvest definitely you want to pull

920
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,440
your rad cover back on for frost

921
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,640
protection um have your overhead

922
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,519
irrigation ready to go at that point

923
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,799
we'll start fertig gating through the uh

924
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,079
trickle system um 1 to two pounds

925
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,039
nitrogen per per week seems to well work

926
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:03,519
well for us go through Harvest um if you

927
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,880
want to carry them over for a second

928
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,679
year you can basically mow um the leaves

929
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,160
off the plants and that's all you'll do

930
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,118
but then keep them watered um resume

931
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,480
some of the fertigation to get them get

932
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,400
them going you won't need R covers for

933
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,838
that second fall um because you should

934
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,240
have plenty of plant growth out there

935
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,799
already but you will want to protect

936
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:25,199
them for the winter and then you just

937
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,440
continue um once you get um you know

938
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,719
into that second winter then you'll just

939
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,519
you know go on through with removing

940
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,559
straw the following spring and

941
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:37,358
harvesting and that's it in a nutshell

942
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:39,039
so um um if people wouldn't mind I think

943
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,000
we're going to hold the questions till

944
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,440
the very end just to make sure that we

945
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,639
have plenty of opportunity for Lewis to

946
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
to speak and Kathy I want to thank you

947
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:51,358
that was

948
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,839
great um let me just quickly uh change

949
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:58,799
these um pods here and put ls's

950
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:58,799
presentation up

951
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:21,759
and I'd like to introduce our second

952
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,480
speaker um today Lewis Dr Lewis jet is

953
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,720
the associate professor of horiculture

954
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,920
and the extension specialist for

955
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,439
vegetables and small fruits

956
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,838
at the University of West Virginia and

957
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,039
he's also done a lot of work in Missouri

958
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,599
um he had a handout that will be

959
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:43,719
available for you folks at the very last

960
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,680
portion of our um session and that you

961
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:48,078
can download onto your own computer and

962
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,759
I'll make sure to point that out to you

963
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,000
and then one other thing that I forgot

964
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,800
to share with everyone um let me just

965
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,679
see if I can make sure

966
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,760
to show this if you can follow on my

967
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:03,480
cursor if you go to full screen for

968
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,760
those of us um for those of us who like

969
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,960
to see the screen really big I'm going

970
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,040
to enable you to change it yourselves so

971
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,039
each one of you can push full screen and

972
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,838
make it take up the screen and then you

973
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,239
uh don't look at the attendee list or

974
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:21,679
the chat but that's up to you to do to

975
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:25,078
do that okay um without further Ado I'd

976
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,078
like to introduce Dr

977
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,318
jet okay thank you Laura I appreciate

978
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,920
you inviting me for this um webinar

979
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:36,559
series uh on on strawberry

980
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,159
production and um I mostly work with

981
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,799
vegetables u in high tunnels but the

982
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:44,039
small fruits are a new area that we've

983
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,839
been we've been looking at and so I want

984
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,400
to cover some of the integrated crop

985
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:51,279
management techniques that um you would

986
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,280
typically um use if you're if you're

987
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,000
growing strawberries within a high

988
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,599
tunnel I think many of you know what a

989
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,559
high tunnel is but for those of you who

990
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,880
who haven't encountered one of these

991
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:06,239
structures they're they're really just a

992
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,480
an advanced uh way to extend the growing

993
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,519
season and particularly through the

994
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,639
Northeast the New England Mid-Atlantic

995
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:17,480
region there's a a major uh adoption of

996
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:21,078
this type of technology to to lengthen

997
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,240
the growing season and to exclude pests

998
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,760
uh particularly organic Growers find

999
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:28,519
them u a great tool for growing crops

1000
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,800
organic Tech Ally without pesticide use

1001
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:36,239
or limited pesticide use um and um here

1002
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,680
in the um the Mid-Atlantic region in

1003
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,838
West Virginia and even in the midwest

1004
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,960
where I was at

1005
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:45,159
before um we were able to extend the

1006
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,440
growing season on most crops um by 3

1007
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,440
months but if you be really creative

1008
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,960
with these high tunnels you can actually

1009
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,200
get three crops within a a 12mon period

1010
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,400
um so you're you're able to grow a lot

1011
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:02,118
of food um in a very limited space uh in

1012
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,200
a um in a in a year so that's that's

1013
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,920
that's certainly reason why they're

1014
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,598
becoming popular they let you grow uh

1015
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,880
crops that you normally couldn't grow at

1016
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,240
your uh latitude or your region and so

1017
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,119
it opens the door for growing crops um

1018
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:20,000
out of their traditional season and even

1019
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,240
varieties that may be sensitive to cold

1020
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,358
weather um by putting them in a high

1021
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,318
tunnel you're protecting them from

1022
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,759
extreme cold and you're able to grow

1023
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:29,119
them much farther north than what you

1024
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,160
normally could and then finally they're

1025
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,680
they're used to supplement field

1026
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:37,078
production so many many Growers who use

1027
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,960
these high tunnels use them mostly for

1028
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,240
early season production sometimes late

1029
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,760
season production but they're also

1030
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,759
complimenting what they're also growing

1031
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,200
in the field so there's just a

1032
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,640
continual uh supply of food over a very

1033
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:51,799
long period of time so that's why they

1034
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,358
have

1035
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,680
U Been rapidly adopted and there are

1036
00:43:54,358 --> 00:44:00,119
many shapes and designs on high tunnels

1037
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:05,598
I've seen so many permutations on size

1038
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:08,559
and and U inall designs and and and

1039
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,119
whatever but but generally um they are a

1040
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,079
solar Greenhouse uh you're trapping um

1041
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,680
radiant energy from the Sun and you're

1042
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,960
using that to as I said to to advance

1043
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:22,480
the growth of the crop and and generally

1044
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,599
um most people who who Define a high

1045
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,838
tunnels claim they only have one or

1046
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,960
should have only one layer of plastic

1047
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:31,799
but I think the farther north you go uh

1048
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,000
a double layer of plastic on a high

1049
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,880
tunnel is is a a great

1050
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,519
benefit

1051
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,680
um so you know you could either have one

1052
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:44,838
or or a double layer of plastic with the

1053
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:48,039
structure so uh what they what they also

1054
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:50,679
do is is I said um accumulate heat over

1055
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:54,759
time and this is just a a temperature

1056
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:56,000
graph of u high tunnel versus ambient uh

1057
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
this happens to actually be one of our

1058
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
strawberry

1059
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,720
um High tunnels and without looking at

1060
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,920
the the actual numbers what we found is

1061
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,399
just a single layer uh a plastic High

1062
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,519
tunnel uh increases the average daily

1063
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,760
temperature from 7 to 10 degrees per day

1064
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,039
so that's that's fairly significant for

1065
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,720
for crop growth over

1066
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:21,558
time we did a survey on U what is grown

1067
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:25,558
in high tunnels and these are some of

1068
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,480
the most popular crops um I think most

1069
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:30,079
of you probably would expect crops like

1070
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,838
tomatoes and salad greens to be widely

1071
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,559
grown High tunnels because they're high

1072
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:37,838
volume long season crops with high value

1073
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,839
uh but strawberries are becoming a

1074
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,599
popular

1075
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:44,400
crop uh for high tunnels uh and also

1076
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,800
other small fruit such as brambles which

1077
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,039
I think will be discussed um a little

1078
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,440
later on in this in this webinar

1079
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:56,039
series um so there's a question on

1080
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,599
finding a a reasonably priced

1081
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,199
temperature monitoring

1082
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,160
system um

1083
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:04,239
well the one that we are using uh to

1084
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:08,118
monitor

1085
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:11,558
temperature uh is just a u either a

1086
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,079
watchdog or a u what they call a hobo

1087
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:17,119
Data Logger and they can log temperature

1088
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,680
for you and we also use wireless

1089
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,039
thermometers um to to uh uh monitor

1090
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:24,838
temperature so I'm not quite sure the

1091
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,759
price differences between those those

1092
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:29,358
different uh different types

1093
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,680
but uh as I'll talk about later

1094
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,880
temperature Management in these high

1095
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:38,078
tunnels is crucial U because one of the

1096
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:42,280
benefits as I as I said is accumulating

1097
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:45,200
heat but they're also manually vented so

1098
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,000
it's up to the operator to control

1099
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,439
temperature as much as possible so it

1100
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,400
can either be too hot or too cold and

1101
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,639
that can actually be detrimental to the

1102
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,358
the particular crop so we're going to be

1103
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,799
talking about strawberries and I think

1104
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:02,039
strawberries um are perfect crop for

1105
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:05,920
high tunnels mainly because um they are

1106
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:08,759
an early season crop and um I preached

1107
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,159
to my Growers here in West Virginia that

1108
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,680
we need more supply of early season

1109
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:17,440
crops and and berries fit very well

1110
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,480
within that that mix um the big question

1111
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,079
is whether they're profitable to be

1112
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,719
grown in a high tunnel and that depends

1113
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,318
on a couple factors which I'll talk

1114
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:29,519
about a little later on as farmers

1115
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,400
markets open earlier um you there is a

1116
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,880
strong demand for berries so early

1117
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:38,240
season berries um um there is a premium

1118
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,160
price for them uh not quite as much as

1119
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,239
there is for early seasoned Tomatoes but

1120
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:46,558
it it is fairly U fairly profitable so

1121
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:48,399
why grow High tunnel strawberries well I

1122
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,040
recommend that whenever you you choose a

1123
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,079
crop to grow in your high tunnel and

1124
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,880
there are there are scores of props that

1125
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,039
you can can produce in the high tunnel

1126
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,880
it depends on your your particular

1127
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,639
Market but there are really two things

1128
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,200
um two criteria that I look at when I

1129
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,199
when I choose a crop and it has to have

1130
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,639
high value and also high high volume or

1131
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:10,239
high yield potential and there are some

1132
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,960
crops that have high value but don't

1133
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,358
yield much per plant and that's that's

1134
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,358
sort of a problem so remember those two

1135
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,960
criteria as we as we go along uh we talk

1136
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:23,480
about this

1137
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:26,400
crop now a lot of Growers who adopt High

1138
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,280
tunnels uh on their Farm as I said

1139
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,039
earlier with the survey use it for

1140
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,680
tomatoes tomatoes grow vertically they

1141
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,239
they yield a lot of fruit per plant uh

1142
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:39,399
there's a high there's a high price for

1143
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:42,838
early seasoned tomatoes so um maybe

1144
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,079
eight out of 10 high tunnel producers U

1145
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:48,078
grow

1146
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,880
tomatoes either either entirely in the

1147
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,559
high tunnel or in combination with other

1148
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,838
crops in the high tunnels but

1149
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:57,760
strawberries could possibly be a good

1150
00:48:53,838 --> 00:49:00,279
crop rotation choice for tomatoes or

1151
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,319
complement tomato production in in the

1152
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,160
um High

1153
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,440
tunnel now Kathy U mentioned different

1154
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:09,239
types of strawberries the day neutrals

1155
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,039
and the short day or June Bearer types

1156
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,759
most of my work and experience with

1157
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,920
Growers has been with the June bearers

1158
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,920
although I think the farther north you

1159
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,358
go um the day neutral types have

1160
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,480
tremendous potential uh we have just

1161
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,119
started a project this year with growing

1162
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,960
day neutrals in in in the high tunnels I

1163
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,358
don't have the data compiled yet yet but

1164
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,280
I I think particularly these types of

1165
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,358
crop these types of strawberries that do

1166
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,720
well in cooler weather um would be very

1167
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:40,480
well suited uh to farther north such as

1168
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:40,480
the day neutral

1169
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,119
types okay uh one thing that I I highly

1170
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,039
recommend when you grow any crop in the

1171
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:49,760
high tunnel is is to make sure that you

1172
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:51,279
have the soil tested prior to planting

1173
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,520
the straw uh the strawberries in the

1174
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,160
high tunnel um and this is just a

1175
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:00,838
picture of it's kind of hard to maybe

1176
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,199
you see what it is exactly but

1177
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:06,039
U let's

1178
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:09,798
see but this area through here that the

1179
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:12,119
white the white area uh the the Crusty

1180
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:16,000
area is actually sort of salt deposits

1181
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:19,200
that build up in the high tunnel uh from

1182
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,639
repeated fertigation of U of different

1183
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:25,358
types of fertilizers and I've had a lot

1184
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:27,480
of Growers um U have questions about

1185
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,239
that whether that is you know causing

1186
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,639
the salt levels in the soil to be very

1187
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:35,039
high so we recently tested this soil and

1188
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:36,960
the so the salt levels are very high

1189
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,599
right around the emitters but the rest

1190
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,400
of the soil does not have very high salt

1191
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:44,838
levels the reason I mentioned this is um

1192
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:49,240
strawberries are very sensitive to salt

1193
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:50,558
um they are they will show U they will

1194
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:53,000
show

1195
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,798
damage U you can see here they will show

1196
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,400
damage U to the

1197
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:59,519
tissue uh from Salt in injury I think I

1198
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,039
have a picture of that in a moment this

1199
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:05,239
is salt damage to u to strawberries some

1200
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,838
of the margin on the crosis on the

1201
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:10,598
leaves that you see here and U so if

1202
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,480
you're putting down a a lot of

1203
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,920
fertilizers in high tunnels particularly

1204
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,440
amonium nitrate or Ura you could have a

1205
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,039
salt build up or if you're using certain

1206
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,880
animal based uh compost animal manure

1207
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,400
based compost you can have high salts

1208
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,760
too so just something to to be aware of

1209
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,639
so have your compost tested um as I

1210
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,200
showed earlier this is compost that we

1211
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,598
put in our high tunnel or one of our

1212
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:40,439
high tunnels um as a soil amendment it's

1213
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:42,240
an animal manure based compost and uh

1214
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,599
again like I said it's important to have

1215
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:49,719
that tested either at the U your local

1216
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,480
uh State uh land grant uh so testing lab

1217
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:53,759
or private

1218
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,920
lab

1219
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,280
um is there a difference between ever

1220
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,240
bearing and neutral strawberries uh I

1221
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,000
think yes there is I know Marvin Prince

1222
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:06,118
would have a better answer for that than

1223
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,679
I would but uh most of the varieties you

1224
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,480
know that we have looked at have been

1225
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:16,199
strictly I think day neutral types the

1226
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:16,199
ever bear types um which are still

1227
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:54,759
um does everybody hear Louis now I I

1228
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:58,440
lost him there for a second and I I

1229
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,440
think you're okay now

1230
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,880
okay good all right um the other thing

1231
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,838
too to remember is if you are using

1232
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,358
compost if you are inclined to use more

1233
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:12,119
organic amendments is to have the

1234
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:14,719
compost tested uh not only as I said for

1235
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:17,798
salts but also for pH and other other

1236
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,519
nutrients most composts is 1 to 2% uh

1237
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:21,759
nitrogen it can be very high in

1238
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,880
potassium and sometimes phosphorus uh

1239
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,440
depending on the source and uh

1240
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,519
surprising to some um folks it can have

1241
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,480
also very high pH so using too much

1242
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:35,880
compost can actually create problems for

1243
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,960
crops like U like strawberry so but you

1244
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,079
can also use synthetic fertilizers to

1245
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,798
amend the soil now when we we grow crops

1246
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:48,119
in the high tunnel um the crop is grown

1247
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:51,519
directly in the soil under the structure

1248
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:54,200
now I I have nothing against using

1249
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:56,759
soless uh mixes and I know there's some

1250
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:59,679
folks here that that use the uh compost

1251
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,000
bags and which I think have great

1252
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,000
potential particularly if you can't move

1253
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,599
the high tunnel or you aren't able to

1254
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,559
leech um the soil in the high tunnel

1255
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,920
enough um through natural rainfall so I

1256
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,559
see some potential for using soiless

1257
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,559
systems in high tunnels um and I don't

1258
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,680
entirely rule them out although you know

1259
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:23,559
the majority of rowers are using the the

1260
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:27,440
native soil underneath the structure to

1261
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,640
grow the crop and if possible the U uh

1262
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,838
the strawberry should be placed on

1263
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,598
raised beds and these are these can be

1264
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:35,838
made manually uh which we have a lot of

1265
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,280
Growers do and then they um there are

1266
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:41,480
some companies that sell a compact bed

1267
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:44,440
shaper which makes a really nice uh

1268
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,519
Crown bed that you can you can plan on

1269
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:51,920
uh in the high tunnel so similar to

1270
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:54,759
this or you can use a flat U flat row

1271
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,358
system but generally I like to use U

1272
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:00,920
raised bed the AL PL planning date U is

1273
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:05,039
really dependent upon your region of the

1274
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:07,280
country and U uh you know like I said

1275
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,159
it's very difficult to generalize with

1276
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,119
there's so many different different U uh

1277
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,759
folks here on the in the

1278
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:17,960
meeting but I think one way to look at

1279
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,200
it maybe as a rule of thumb is to look

1280
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:23,880
at your your your field planning date

1281
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:27,199
and um the high tunnel gives you almost

1282
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:32,480
an extra month so your planning Windows

1283
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:34,960
expanded by three maybe perhaps 4 weeks

1284
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,280
um over what your your field planning

1285
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,480
date is for these these particular types

1286
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,200
of strawberries so that's one of the

1287
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,280
reasons why you know people like high

1288
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:43,199
tunnel production is it gives you just a

1289
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,880
larger

1290
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:48,960
window um to u to get your crops planted

1291
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,960
so as Kathy was saying if it's difficult

1292
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,159
to get plugs that early in August in

1293
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,639
early August or even Late July in some

1294
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:57,960
regions well with a high tunnel you have

1295
00:55:55,639 --> 00:56:02,719
a longer plan window you can perhaps get

1296
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:05,960
plugs a little bit later in the year so

1297
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:08,199
um but the problem is if you plant too

1298
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,400
late she mentioned you just don't get

1299
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,519
the U uh the vegetative growth and the

1300
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,599
flowerbud

1301
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:17,798
initiation uh in the fall and your

1302
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,039
yields are dramatically reduced so

1303
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:20,559
sometimes it's trial and error and I

1304
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:21,599
know some folks may be in your region

1305
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,319
have been doing some research for

1306
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,798
planning dates and that's that's

1307
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:29,038
probably something you should look

1308
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:31,358
at different planning um Arrangements on

1309
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:35,039
um High tunnel strawberries uh go with a

1310
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:39,038
two row bed uh or more but if you're

1311
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:43,000
using a two row bed uh recommend putting

1312
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:47,359
on two U two lines of drip tape uh on

1313
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,239
the uh on the bed so for every row of U

1314
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:52,358
of berries you have in the high tunnel

1315
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:54,759
you should have one row of drip tape

1316
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:56,759
because uh again you're protecting the

1317
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,880
crop from rain and the crops entirely

1318
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,319
dependent upon you for water so you want

1319
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,358
to make sure that you're providing

1320
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:06,358
enough water and nut nutrients to the

1321
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:08,960
crop so um particularly if you move to a

1322
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,639
three or four row bed on strawberries uh

1323
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,599
you need to have you know three to four

1324
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:18,279
drip lines per per

1325
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:20,400
bed um so anyway that's U that's typical

1326
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,160
planning Arrangement there some Growers

1327
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,160
have tried four row beds and we have

1328
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:26,920
tried it uh as well in some of our

1329
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:28,558
research

1330
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,280
the problem you get into with these high

1331
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,880
tunnels is that you're looking at 2 to

1332
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,640
3,000 square ft in the high tunnel or if

1333
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,838
you move to a ha grve system where you

1334
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:40,719
have you know multiple Bays you can have

1335
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:43,038
larger area but the the inclination is

1336
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:46,439
to crowd plants in there and I think

1337
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:48,960
that's a mistake um because you can get

1338
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,838
more production from less from an

1339
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,880
optimal plant population than you could

1340
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:54,078
by just really packing plants in tight

1341
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,039
so that's what we found with the four

1342
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,880
row bed uh on strawberry

1343
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,000
is that you're actually you're paying

1344
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,480
you're you're paying more for for extra

1345
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,119
plants but you're not getting that extra

1346
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:11,000
yield um so we have found a two or three

1347
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:15,039
row bed to be optimal uh for um for

1348
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,039
planting um in these these uh these

1349
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:19,078
structures okay so how many plants can

1350
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,318
you can you get in there you can get

1351
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:24,920
anywhere from, 1500 to 2,000 strawberry

1352
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:27,798
plants uh per Commercial High

1353
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,159
tunnel and and this would be a typical

1354
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:33,358
spacing uh I sort of like to go almost

1355
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:37,199
equidistant uh between plants and

1356
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:39,199
between rows 12 to 15 in between plants

1357
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,399
and and the same the uh the same

1358
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:44,199
distance between rows on the bed and

1359
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,559
sort of a typical uh staggered uh

1360
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:48,399
planning Arrangement like this and I

1361
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,760
think that would be

1362
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:56,639
ideal with of the bed can be anywhere

1363
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,799
from uh 24 in to as wide as almost 40 42

1364
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,358
in

1365
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:02,759
wide and

1366
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:04,239
um this is a four row bed with three

1367
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,039
drip lines per bed and the plants are

1368
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:09,399
very crowded in there and it's led

1369
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:13,880
to some aphid

1370
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,519
problems so Lis excuse me um uh shiaka

1371
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,838
county has a question that I think is

1372
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,440
pretty pertinent about how big is that

1373
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:21,558
tunnel do you know the measurements of

1374
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,559
the

1375
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,559
tunnel well most of the tunnels that uh

1376
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,798
that we've been working with or using

1377
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:35,798
our research are 20 to 30 feet wide and

1378
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:37,838
96 feet long so that's a typical okay

1379
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:39,440
thank you and I think it looks like you

1380
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,558
might be starting to talk about sug

1381
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,599
weise's question um talking about

1382
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:47,400
substrate systems that she asked and it

1383
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,400
looks like you might touch on that

1384
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,039
now well yeah I just my only comment

1385
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,679
about it is I mean we have just started

1386
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,880
this year growing um strawberries in um

1387
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,960
elevated gutters and I don't have data

1388
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,798
to share on that but you know there's

1389
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,358
some interest in sort of the vertical

1390
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,759
growing systems in these high tunnels

1391
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,199
and um I think there's some potential

1392
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:16,599
there but there have been some problems

1393
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:19,798
with uh with yield um per plant so

1394
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:24,160
someone needs to to really work up uh a

1395
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:26,239
design where there's less U shading by

1396
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:30,279
individual plants and the yield levels

1397
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:31,719
are high uh you know from top to bottom

1398
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,240
there was a recent article in the

1399
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:35,759
vegetable Growers news I believe it was

1400
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:37,959
in the June issue where the grower up in

1401
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,839
Michigan was was looking at vertical

1402
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:44,280
growing systems and actually he's he is

1403
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:45,639
designed um system he thinks works but I

1404
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,440
think that's some of the issues that we

1405
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:49,960
need to to look at in the future is is

1406
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,559
growing these plants more vertically

1407
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,760
getting more plants and also getting

1408
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:56,359
higher yield per plant because if you're

1409
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,599
just growing a just in a flat system in

1410
01:00:56,358 --> 01:01:02,960
the in the soil as I said you can get a

1411
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:04,559
fixed optimal number of plants but um at

1412
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,119
some point your yield level has to be

1413
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,640
high enough to make it

1414
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:13,599
profitable um Capital cost per square

1415
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:17,358
foot of a high tunnel um generally um

1416
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,599
they're $2 to $3 per square foot uh is

1417
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,639
is is generally what the average and

1418
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:26,039
they I said there's a lot of variance in

1419
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:28,519
in that estimate too because U uh it

1420
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:31,079
depending on whether it's a manufactured

1421
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:33,400
High tunnel or a homemade High tunnel U

1422
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:36,079
the cost can be can be pretty uh pretty

1423
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,760
wide but what a lot of our Growers have

1424
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,920
been doing uh and I think it might be

1425
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,880
the case throughout the the Northeast is

1426
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:46,200
poaching U old greenhouse frames from U

1427
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,559
nurseries or Greenhouse businesses that

1428
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,399
are going out of out of business and

1429
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,039
then using those frames for high tunnels

1430
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,318
and all they have to do is just add a u

1431
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,720
a hip board to it so that they can roll

1432
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:01,920
up the side and get cross

1433
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:04,598
ventilation okay so

1434
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:08,000
um well I think it depends like I said

1435
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:10,240
on a on a 30 by 96 High tunnel the the

1436
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,559
one that we are about ready to put

1437
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,759
plastic on in about 2 weeks it's

1438
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,920
probably cost around

1439
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,880
$7,000 uh with every every component to

1440
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:24,358
it but um again like I said that that

1441
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:27,519
that that price varies depending on the

1442
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:29,558
on the manufacturer

1443
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:33,559
um the varieties that you can choose

1444
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:34,798
from are um you know they're Fair wide

1445
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:38,400
group of

1446
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:40,358
varieties these particular varieties um

1447
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,119
are ones that are bred primarily for

1448
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:43,798
plastic culture and of course you're

1449
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:46,440
probably familiar with most most of

1450
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:49,159
these uh Chandler Camaros and sweet

1451
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,318
Charlie and Ventana and even Festival

1452
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,879
those are the ones that we've grown in

1453
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,440
the high tunnels but I I think there's

1454
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,119
there's a lot of potential for other

1455
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,039
short day varieties that c Kathy

1456
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:01,960
mentioned such as the Wendy LaMore Dar

1457
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:04,640
select and the cica um as varieties that

1458
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,920
could be potentially later than these

1459
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:09,118
varieties and so a mix of these

1460
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,599
varieties plus some of those uh other

1461
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,440
June Bearer varieties could give you a

1462
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,838
longer production season but our our

1463
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,480
most uh consistent variety has been

1464
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:21,000
Chandler um and I know it's been tried

1465
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,719
and tested in many regions of the

1466
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,159
country but it it it seems that's not

1467
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:28,038
Chandler in the picture there but

1468
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:31,318
Festival actually but uh it it seems to

1469
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:35,119
to have consistently high yields um and

1470
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:38,759
the flavor that U most Growers like for

1471
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:41,400
for uh for local markets so um but I

1472
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:44,039
think the U the other varieties that

1473
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,798
were mentioned uh could could certainly

1474
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:49,839
complement Chandler as varieties to add

1475
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:56,639
to your high tunnel so the uh the reason

1476
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:59,119
I mentioned the uh plants um I me uh

1477
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:01,719
um yes I was just doting the comment on

1478
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,440
using the old hoop houses that were

1479
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:07,118
modified I I think that's that certainly

1480
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:11,318
is is the way to to uh start into high

1481
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:16,400
tunnel production is to is to recycle um

1482
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:17,838
frames as much as possible and U and and

1483
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,039
and then that way you can you can

1484
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:22,159
certainly cut the the the startup costs

1485
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:23,920
because they're immediately profitable

1486
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,318
and you can recover your cost within a

1487
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,599
year and then if you want to you know

1488
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:29,719
purchase a a brand new frame the

1489
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:32,519
following year you certainly would have

1490
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:34,838
the money to do it um just sort of

1491
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:37,960
adding on to what Kathy was saying about

1492
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:41,759
um plants for for growing strawberries

1493
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:43,880
or plant sources or plant types um I I

1494
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,440
mention this because um the single

1495
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,760
biggest production cost of growing

1496
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:52,358
strawberries in high tunnel is plant

1497
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,920
costs um so you have some choices here

1498
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:56,480
on different types of plants that you

1499
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,400
can that you can uh use use you can buy

1500
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,760
your own Runner Tips and and root the

1501
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:05,200
plugs yourself and um or you can get be

1502
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,240
root plants uh or you can get plugs

1503
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:11,118
ready to plant and we we've done all

1504
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:12,439
three so um the most economical uh is

1505
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,200
probably going to be rooting your own

1506
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,679
Runner Tips if you can get Runner Tips

1507
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:18,558
in time but like I said because your

1508
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,078
planting Windows been expanded by the

1509
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:23,920
use of the high tunnel you have more

1510
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:27,278
time to get plant material um for the uh

1511
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,680
for your high tunnel structure

1512
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:30,760
okay and these are some strawberry plant

1513
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:34,199
suppliers laori mentioned the handout

1514
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:37,039
that I um I have that companies this

1515
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:38,719
presentation that all this is is is

1516
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:43,119
listed within that

1517
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:46,318
um um in that uh that

1518
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:49,119
handout well okay the question was um

1519
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:52,719
2,000 plants one pounds of strawberries

1520
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:55,240
per plant um in the ground for 4 to 6

1521
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:59,199
months that's that's approximately

1522
01:05:55,239 --> 01:06:03,358
correct I mean uh one pound per plant it

1523
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:05,278
should be your your base your base yield

1524
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:08,558
it should be the yield that you should

1525
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:12,358
at least get um if you're not getting a

1526
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:15,278
pound per plant um the economics just

1527
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:17,719
don't U don't work out for high tunnel

1528
01:06:15,278 --> 01:06:20,599
strawberries so you should be somewhere

1529
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:24,199
in the in the 1 and a half pound range

1530
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:26,400
um I believe uh that actually with some

1531
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:29,558
of these day neutral types although they

1532
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,680
have a longer production season longer

1533
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:34,640
picking season you can actually get

1534
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,639
close to 2 lbs per plant but for these

1535
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:38,920
June bear types you should be getting at

1536
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:42,879
least a pound in order for this to cash

1537
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,400
flow um and to to to make it profitable

1538
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,400
for high tunnels because for every crop

1539
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,079
that you choose in a high tunnel there's

1540
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,639
another Cho there's another crop choice

1541
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,599
that can replace it so they have to be

1542
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:56,440
profitable uh for that to to be a good

1543
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:59,079
choice uh just the cycle on on growing

1544
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,838
the plants in the in the uh in the high

1545
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:03,599
tunnel structure generally for the

1546
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:05,440
varieties that I mentioned earlier such

1547
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,440
as Chandler camarosa they're planted in

1548
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,200
the fall uh and the planting date could

1549
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:13,679
be anywhere from Late July through mid

1550
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,838
September depending on your on your

1551
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,558
region but they're planted they grow

1552
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:18,880
through the fall uh the high tunnel

1553
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:21,599
keeps them warm they put on good

1554
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:25,519
vegetative growth they they they they uh

1555
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,278
develop Branch crowns and then um row

1556
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,920
covers are sort of interesting to use in

1557
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:33,639
a high tunnel because um there really is

1558
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:36,400
no exact formula for using them like

1559
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:37,318
what Kathy was saying with the field uh

1560
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,079
field

1561
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:43,759
production um actually by using rad

1562
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:46,240
covers in high tunnels you can get you

1563
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,079
know very early flowering on some of

1564
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:51,239
these varieties and um some of these

1565
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:54,278
varieties such as sweet Charlie have

1566
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:56,358
very shallow dormy or no dorcy at all

1567
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:59,679
and so they will actually fly in January

1568
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:03,639
or February if if it uh if it's warm

1569
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:05,078
enough um so you can lose uh production

1570
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:07,719
because of early flowering so you don't

1571
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,599
want to put the row cover uh on these

1572
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:14,519
high tunnel strawberries too

1573
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:17,239
early um and we use a medium weigh uh to

1574
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:20,359
heavyweight row cover which is 1 o to 1

1575
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:24,479
and a/4 ounce um row cover we find that

1576
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:27,520
to be most effective but um I I think I

1577
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:29,278
think I can speak generally and say that

1578
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,199
you shouldn't use a row cover in a high

1579
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,759
tunnel before December I think that's a

1580
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:39,838
that's a pretty safe uh thing to

1581
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:43,039
say now we have used it um in our

1582
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:46,039
project primarily for extreme freeze

1583
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:49,359
protection so if the if the U ambient

1584
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:51,838
temperature was going to get um below 20

1585
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:54,159
fight we would be using row covers for

1586
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:56,000
protection on that uh but we would not

1587
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:57,559
keep the row covers on the on the

1588
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,198
strawberries

1589
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,798
continually um and we would use it the

1590
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:06,559
following spring when um they begin to

1591
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:09,838
flour so for frost protection so we were

1592
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:13,279
sort of um using it uh intermittently

1593
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:16,519
through the U through the uh the

1594
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:19,520
season so um again like I said you don't

1595
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,799
you don't want to to use it uh use it to

1596
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,400
soon a lot of Growers use either the

1597
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:28,519
floating row cover cover or we use a low

1598
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:32,039
tunnel which is supported by hoops and

1599
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:34,719
um either way is can be used although

1600
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:37,759
you do get more uh heat built up with a

1601
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:40,920
with a low tunnel versus just a floating

1602
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:44,719
row cover

1603
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:47,520
okay uh now generally when the plants

1604
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,239
are going into dormy in December in the

1605
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,279
high

1606
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:53,838
tunnel um you know they sort of flatten

1607
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:56,520
out and we like to see about four to

1608
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:59,039
five Branch crowns on the on on the uh

1609
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,280
the uh the strawberries and the the

1610
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:05,960
diameter of the rosette uh should be

1611
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:07,319
about 5 to 6 Ines in uh in length and

1612
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,039
that's a

1613
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:13,039
good you know starting point for how uh

1614
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:16,359
how your plant should be going into

1615
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:18,840
dormy problem that we had last year uh

1616
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:21,559
with a lot of Growers is they U we had a

1617
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,400
very cloudy fall and we didn't get a lot

1618
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,760
of um of U growth in the fall so yields

1619
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:27,799
were much lower this year here for a lot

1620
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,800
of Growers so that that is something

1621
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,520
that could could be a problem in certain

1622
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,159
areas um if you plant too early in the

1623
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,120
high tunnel you can get Runner

1624
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:39,679
production um and that's something that

1625
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:41,599
you don't want on plastic because these

1626
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,000
these plants are grown on plastic mulch

1627
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,600
under a plastic cover and there's no

1628
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,158
place for the runners to root and you're

1629
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,920
not creating a matted row so you want to

1630
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:54,519
just have one Central uh mother plant

1631
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:56,760
producing large fruit from five five

1632
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,480
Branch crowns roughly 10 flowers per

1633
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,719
Branch CR but no daughter plants so

1634
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:01,799
you'll need to pull those daughter

1635
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,319
plants

1636
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,159
off probably a good indication that

1637
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:09,198
you're keeping your high tunnel too warm

1638
01:11:07,158 --> 01:11:12,799
is you're getting you're getting Runner

1639
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:15,279
production so uh that that would be an

1640
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,679
indication of of maybe poor temperature

1641
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,679
management which leads me into this

1642
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,000
issue of temperature Management in the

1643
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:22,000
high tunnel because this always

1644
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,760
surprises Growers at how much time they

1645
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,439
have to spend uh adjusting the vents um

1646
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:32,360
in these structures so you see the vents

1647
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:36,759
on on these high tunnels on the side and

1648
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:38,960
um you know you generally want to keep

1649
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,320
um the high tunnel on the cool side for

1650
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,319
strawberries because they are a cool

1651
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:46,880
seasoned crop so uh you know in days

1652
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,759
where it might get warm and in in the

1653
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,840
late fall or even winter days where the

1654
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:55,760
temperatur can get warm um you know you

1655
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:59,119
may need to vent it so U rolling up the

1656
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,760
sides is not a is is not uh a bad thing

1657
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:04,519
to do even in the uh the middle of

1658
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,199
winter uh is there more heat

1659
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,800
accumulation under high tunnels or low

1660
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:11,960
tunnels well

1661
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:15,199
U um the thing about that is using low

1662
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:17,319
tunnels within High tunnels is extremely

1663
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:21,319
effective so I mean you're you're going

1664
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:23,599
to get it's sort of uh you know

1665
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:25,719
synergism between the two that you get

1666
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,560
even more but you had a low tunnel out

1667
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:29,960
in the

1668
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,679
field um you know they do increase the

1669
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,840
the air temperature around the plant but

1670
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:36,920
eventually they they reach the ambient

1671
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,719
temperature much faster than what a high

1672
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,960
tunnel would but when you put them in a

1673
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:44,840
high tunnel you almost double the

1674
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,719
effectiveness of the row cover so um you

1675
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:50,679
know that's that's one of the advantages

1676
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:54,000
of using low tunnels within within High

1677
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:57,000
tunnels um okay so also as I said if

1678
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,520
you're if you're not Ting your high

1679
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,679
tunnel um adequately you can get

1680
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:06,480
premature flowering um on some of these

1681
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:10,079
varieties and um the flowers are

1682
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:12,559
immediately Frozen and that's lost yield

1683
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:12,559
uh from the

1684
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,839
plant there are some Growers that that

1685
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:21,079
will use backup heaters in high Tunnels

1686
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,600
for a lot of crops and the backup

1687
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:25,719
heaters that are used for strawberries

1688
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:28,199
are only used for frost protection uh

1689
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:30,760
but but generally if you use row covers

1690
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:33,638
if you put your row cover on early

1691
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,880
enough in the day before uh it gets cold

1692
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:38,279
at night you can trap enough heat under

1693
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,760
the row cover within the high tunnel to

1694
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:43,880
prevent um damage from a frost or a

1695
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,920
light freeze if temperatures got down

1696
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,039
into the teens if you had a single layer

1697
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:52,359
of plastic you would need a backup

1698
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:52,359
heater uh to to prevent

1699
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:59,279
damage okay so um then take uh routine

1700
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:01,439
tissue samples I I highly recommend that

1701
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:03,719
that's done primarily at at first

1702
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:08,638
flowering uh the following

1703
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:11,800
spring and uh we take about 20 U leaf

1704
01:14:08,639 --> 01:14:13,840
and pedal samples a per variety per High

1705
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,360
tunnel that's usually enough to get you

1706
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,400
a test and you can send it to either

1707
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:21,719
your diagnos or your your soil Plant

1708
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:24,079
Nutrition lab on campus or uh through a

1709
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:26,719
private lab such as this pollination is

1710
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:30,158
an issue on on strawberries and a lot of

1711
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:33,480
crops within High tunnels because U the

1712
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:35,839
flowering is um so

1713
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:38,759
early that uh a lot of the natural

1714
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,440
pollinators aren't active yet so

1715
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:45,440
uh a lot of in our case in the

1716
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:46,638
midatlantic in the um Midwest um these

1717
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,839
high tunnel strawberries would start

1718
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:51,119
flowering in mid to late March well

1719
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:54,360
that's usually well before most natural

1720
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:56,359
pollinators become become available so

1721
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:59,439
uh the strawberries need to get

1722
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:02,000
pollinated either by air movement or by

1723
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:04,519
bringing in pollinators

1724
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,359
yourself so uh the question was could an

1725
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:09,480
overhead sprinklers be used for frost

1726
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:13,000
protection in high tunnel um yeah I

1727
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:14,559
suppose they could um although u i I

1728
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,119
really haven't used a lot of overhead

1729
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,800
watering in the high tunnel uh you most

1730
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:21,840
of the the watering is done through

1731
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,079
through drip irrigation but that

1732
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,000
certainly is one one thing that you can

1733
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:28,800
do I I suppose if you could keep the

1734
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,238
water from freezing on the plastic uh or

1735
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:34,360
anything like that that would cause any

1736
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:36,678
damage to the to the U the uh poly or or

1737
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:41,079
any the the structure like

1738
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:45,279
that so U to solve the pollination um

1739
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:48,840
issue you can purchase a Class C uh Hive

1740
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,079
which has two or 300 drones in it um and

1741
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,440
uh or you can actually get small nuke

1742
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:56,039
boxes of honeybees but uh the U the uh

1743
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:59,479
bumblebees are are very effective

1744
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:59,479
pollinators for for

1745
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:03,839
strawberries and if you don't get good

1746
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,238
pollination or if the temperature is

1747
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,079
very cool when it's a uh when they're

1748
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:10,718
fllying you can often get misshaping

1749
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,840
fruit which is uh something you you

1750
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,359
don't want you want good quality uniform

1751
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,600
fruit such as this this is all high

1752
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:21,519
tunnel strawberries that you're seeing

1753
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:23,520
now um and the frequency of harvest uh

1754
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,960
generally for these these June bearing

1755
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,920
types um

1756
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:31,158
that you're looking at about a a four a

1757
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,639
excuse me a 6 to 10 week period of

1758
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:36,158
harvest but if you if you include day

1759
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:38,159
neutrals in uh you can uh you can

1760
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:40,319
certainly extend that some things to

1761
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:42,079
consider on that's I'm running out of

1762
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,759
time on The Pest Management is spider

1763
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:46,719
mites and petritis grey mold spidermite

1764
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,000
is the most chronic problem we've had

1765
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,960
with growing strawberries in high

1766
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,960
tunnels and this is some typical

1767
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,480
symptoms of spidermites usually they

1768
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,639
develop within a a specific uh

1769
01:16:55,479 --> 01:17:00,198
area the hot spot usually the center of

1770
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:03,639
the high tunnel where it's warmest but

1771
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:08,158
uh we have been doing work with uh uh

1772
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:10,679
using predatory mites to control um

1773
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,359
spotted uh spider mites in high tunnels

1774
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:16,079
and it's been very effective the

1775
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:19,279
threshold is five five mites per Leaf U

1776
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,840
and by using fyto which is a predatory M

1777
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:24,000
we were able to bring that threshold

1778
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,480
down uh to or bring that KN level down

1779
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,359
to below the threshold

1780
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:32,319
so there's a perfect place to use

1781
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:34,599
predatory um insects or mites is the

1782
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:37,719
high tunnel because you an enclosed area

1783
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:41,120
you have a very small space and the uh

1784
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:43,079
the uh the insects or mites work very

1785
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,359
effectively in those hot spots this is

1786
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:46,399
particularly a problem if you're growing

1787
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,960
mixed crops in high tunnels there's a

1788
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:49,920
center a row of strawberries here and a

1789
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,000
lot of different types of flowers you

1790
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:55,359
can use predatory mites to control um

1791
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,840
mites on not only strawberry but also

1792
01:17:55,359 --> 01:18:00,479
these other

1793
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,880
crops we've used uh lady beetles too

1794
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,759
aphids are a problem if you're over

1795
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:07,639
fertilizing with nitrogen or if you have

1796
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:10,840
too uh too much Lush growth on the uh on

1797
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:12,520
the U the the plant this is petritis

1798
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,840
grey mold which usually occurs you're in

1799
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:18,199
Cloudy cool damp weather uh we like to

1800
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:21,679
remove all the Dead Leaves as much as

1801
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:23,238
possible this is substrate for Bettis so

1802
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,119
uh you want to you want to keep those

1803
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:27,238
under control there's some weed growth

1804
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:31,039
that occurs typically winter annual weed

1805
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:33,238
such as chick weed um occurs around the

1806
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:35,399
planting hole that sometimes need to be

1807
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:38,599
be weeded one of our other serious

1808
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:40,000
problems is vs or Meadow mice and they

1809
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,719
will get underneath the plastic they'll

1810
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,039
overwind in the high tunnel and they'll

1811
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:46,439
actually chew on the crown so um that's

1812
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:49,359
that's an issue to face in the high

1813
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:52,119
tunnels but you don't get deer damage uh

1814
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:54,198
like this so uh there's one advantage of

1815
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:57,319
the high tunnels uh for strawberry

1816
01:18:54,198 --> 01:19:01,439
Growers you do not get uh deer browsing

1817
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:04,719
on the U on the there so um the yields

1818
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:08,678
are 1.2 to 1.3 lb I'd like to be around

1819
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:11,198
1.5 lbs per per plant if you can get

1820
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:13,520
that yield level and you can get a price

1821
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,359
of $3 to $4 per pound which is what most

1822
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,360
Growers have been getting high tunnel

1823
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:18,960
strawberries can be very profitable but

1824
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,039
you have to get that yield level and you

1825
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,800
have to get that price range if you look

1826
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:25,399
at the handout it has all the production

1827
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,760
costs and the different

1828
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:29,799
returns for different prices and yields

1829
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,800
on strawberries that you can look at and

1830
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:34,719
see if you're actually uh making a

1831
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,440
profit or not so I will close it there

1832
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:39,800
and U certainly want to visit maybe the

1833
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:43,198
Cornell High tunnel website and our high

1834
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,679
tunnel website that uh sort of um

1835
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,759
accumulates information from a lot of

1836
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,880
different Louis thank thank you very

1837
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,760
much um and I appreciate I'm sorry to

1838
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:54,920
have to kind of move this along but we

1839
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,520
have a limited time and I um what I'm

1840
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,440
going to do here we're moving into the

1841
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:02,880
final aspect of the talk there are three

1842
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:06,439
polls that I'd love if people just

1843
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:09,760
wanted to give some response um to this

1844
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:12,279
information while we finish up and then

1845
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,159
in the file share the upper right corner

1846
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:17,359
are several different um one is the

1847
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:20,679
handout that was sent to you in advance

1848
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:25,319
uh from Kathy Dem and then the other two

1849
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:27,920
are similar but slightly different um uh

1850
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:30,840
handouts from Dr Lewis jet about high

1851
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:34,560
tunnel growing and so you can upload

1852
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:38,159
those to your own computer um the other

1853
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:42,840
thing I want to remind everyone of is on

1854
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:47,238
Tuesday September 22nd we have a um

1855
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:49,719
insect uh strawberry insect um pest uh

1856
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:51,839
discussion uh Dr Richard Kohl's from the

1857
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,679
University of Connecticut and Dr Greg

1858
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,199
lob from Cornell University are going to

1859
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,920
be talking about

1860
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:02,319
um root weevils and sap Beetle and

1861
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,359
tarnish plant bug respectively and I do

1862
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,399
hope um all of you will get that

1863
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:09,279
announcement for connection and if you

1864
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:11,119
can make it wonderful uh if you can't

1865
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:13,079
just disregard the announcement but we

1866
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,920
decided to start sending because we're

1867
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:16,800
getting so much activity for the

1868
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,800
registration it was just easier to keep

1869
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,639
all of you in one list and send it out

1870
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,600
um but before we log off if anybody else

1871
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:29,000
has any questions for either Kathy demek

1872
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,960
or Lewis jet um we could take those now

1873
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,439
just for a couple of extra

1874
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:37,079
minutes um I know there was one question

1875
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:41,279
that was a asked several times um what

1876
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:43,039
is the difference between uh oh Kathy

1877
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:45,639
answered that great um no real

1878
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:49,079
difference for between day neutral and

1879
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:51,480
everbearing um Pro possibly day

1880
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:55,479
neutral might not be quite

1881
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:55,479
correct and

1882
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:03,439
yeah um yeah all it is is really the day

1883
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:05,279
neutrals aren't really day neutrals and

1884
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:08,079
right now there seems to be moved them

1885
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:10,439
all repeat flowering which okay great

1886
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:12,279
that's good to know so proba all right

1887
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:14,519
does anyone else have uh okay Heather

1888
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:16,359
Bryant what is the optimum pH for

1889
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:20,360
growing

1890
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:20,359
strawberries do either of

1891
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,639
you I can okay good that was what I was

1892
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,639
going to

1893
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:28,639
say

1894
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:34,399
weally um is there any other questions

1895
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,960
it looks like a couple people are typing

1896
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:39,519
rapidly gwy Smith forever bearers if I

1897
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:42,480
want to overwinter do they need to be

1898
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,880
renovated like June

1899
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:49,519
bearers no not on plastic

1900
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:53,400
yep um no uh any other questions looks

1901
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:57,920
like people have stopped typing and most

1902
01:22:53,399 --> 01:23:00,238
people have responded to the polls and

1903
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:03,119
um I think that's it then we made it

1904
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:05,238
just in the nick of time for the log off

1905
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:08,920
and I really want to thank again the

1906
