1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,888
when we think about climate change

2
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,048
mitigation that is the ways in which we

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,518
can reduce our carbon footprint we might

4
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,378
consider turning off the lights when we

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,289
leave the house riding our bike to work

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,650
or driving a fuel-efficient car but most

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,279
of us don't think about the food we eat

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,198
unfortunately when it comes to

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,448
agriculture there's a misconception that

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,760
reducing emissions means sacrificing a

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,279
farms economic viability but this

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,410
needn't be the case when it comes to

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,329
climate change mitigation agriculture

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,339
provides many opportunities for us to

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,079
both reduce our emissions while also

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,660
enhancing the profitability and

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,090
long-term sustainability of our farms

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,679
one of the best examples of this is an

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,800
investment in generating on-farm

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,359
renewable energy to be clear we are not

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,000
talking about growing biofuels for

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,619
ethanol but rather direct on-farm energy

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,350
production through the use of manure

24
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,479
solar and wind these technologies can

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,189
help farms become net zero which means

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,109
that the greenhouse gas emissions

27
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,420
produced on the farm are balanced by the

28
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:09,299
farms efforts to offset or sequester an

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,469
equivalent amount of carbon meet don

31
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,298
orchards don is a dairy farmer and chip

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,799
and apple grower they both have

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,450
different concerns and feelings about

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,310
climate change but they share a

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,890
commitment to farming for renewable

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,329
energy for thousands of years farmers

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,219
like dawn and chip have looked for ways

38
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,599
to maximize their resources and improve

39
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,640
the efficiency of their farms in

40
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,469
continuing this tradition both have been

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,868
able to take advantage of their existing

42
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,609
on-farm resources to produce energy and

43
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:40,920
promote the long-term economic viability

44
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,319
of their operations for done this is

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,519
meant building an anaerobic digester we

46
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,949
have currently about 1,500 milk cows

47
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:52,170
1200 supporting lifestyle we found about

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,340
2,000 acres in Stanley New York we

49
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,929
produce in

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,880
neighborhood of forty million pounds of

51
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,810
milk a year which is marketed locally

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,569
through with the Upstate milk

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,460
cooperative this is a farm that now has

54
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,529
four generations I'm the third my

55
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,019
daughter and my son will be taking the

56
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,750
business over as time moves on three or

57
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,900
four years ago we were investigating

58
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,580
building an anaerobic digester so

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,069
basically an anaerobic digester is a

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,349
containment vessel where the inputs

61
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,449
usually manure and sometimes an

62
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,548
additional feedstock like food wastes or

63
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,280
any other organic material is basically

64
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,319
aggregated and it undergoes a

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,419
decomposition process it normally stays

66
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,518
in there for on average 20 to 25 days

67
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,219
microbes are constantly breaking it down

68
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,829
and through that process a material

69
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:40,259
called biogas is created a sixty percent

70
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:43,230
methane so therefore we can use that as

71
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,389
an input to an electricity generation

72
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,518
unit and generate electricity sort of

73
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,378
like they would with natural gas a farm

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,989
is really usually able for a lot of the

75
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:56,479
year to offset their purchase power

76
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,759
costs from using their own biogas based

77
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,429
electricity on farm the initial reason

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,709
we wanted to build a digester was to

79
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,299
create an ample supply of Betty that was

80
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,250
the original reason we just didn't have

81
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,319
enough betting of the solids to bed the

82
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,949
cows and we wanted a pathogen free Betty

83
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:16,259
the reduction in the odor we are in an

84
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,719
area where there's a fair amount of

85
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,269
housing there's a fair amount of small

86
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,129
little Hamlet's so you know when we're

87
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,980
out there spreading millions of gallons

88
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,299
of

89
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,429
annually we're very sensitive to how the

90
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,709
neighbors feel about it rhinos through

91
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,930
an anaerobic digester doesn't eliminate

92
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,400
eliminate totally but it certainly makes

93
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,260
it more available within the

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,359
neighborhood the ability to go out and

95
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:41,030
put mannar on the fields without a lot

96
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,769
of complaints and a lot of negative

97
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,810
feedback from the community so the in

98
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,209
community friendly is very important to

99
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,859
this this farming operation there's

100
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,658
definitely societal benefits as well

101
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,389
when you get into talking about climate

102
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:55,188
change reduced methane emissions from

103
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,230
livestock I'd say the most important

104
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:58,969
role that digesters played in climate

105
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,560
change mitigation is you're

106
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:02,209
intentionally capturing that methane

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,519
that's produced from the livestock

108
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,200
manure and putting that towards a

109
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,789
beneficial use so instead of that

110
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,348
methane which is a very potent

111
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,239
greenhouse gas being released to the

112
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:13,459
atmosphere you're capturing that and

113
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,769
then once you use that in an engine

114
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,019
generator set to produce electricity you

115
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,870
can reduced purchased fossil fuel-based

116
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,449
power from the grid so that's sort of a

117
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,240
win-win situation so not only has Don

118
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,908
positioned blonde Hurst now and into the

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,848
future to take advantage of generating a

120
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:34,848
renewable electricity resource but also

121
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:37,699
to the extent that there are revenue

122
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:39,860
opportunities presented because of the

123
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,199
ecosystem benefits so if in the future

124
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,689
there's a substantial revenue

125
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,580
opportunity from demonstrating carbon

126
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:49,939
sequestration and carbon management

127
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,859
that's extremely valuable certainly from

128
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,658
the sustainability's of perspective

129
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,460
going forward and the most important

130
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:58,250
sustainability issues financial

131
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,589
sustainability anaerobic digestion

132
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,629
technology works it's definitely been

133
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:04,638
proven it's not a new technology what

134
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,469
really is lacking is an economically

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,788
favorable environment for these things

136
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,960
to really take off in some of the

137
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,269
feasibility studies that we've done

138
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,299
we've come up with sort of tail and

139
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,549
marketing ideas like a green milk

140
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,348
different farms with digesters or you

141
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,180
know climate mitigation strategies could

142
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:22,009
put their milk together and claimed that

143
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,449
it was carbon neutral or green that's

144
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,098
definitely a marketing strategy and I

145
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,340
think people pit would pay more just

146
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:29,379
like they pay more for organic

147
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,719
most dairies are size and frankly

148
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,399
probably a little larger over the next

149
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,380
10 years have got to adopt some sort of

150
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,109
technology we've got a resource within

151
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,389
the waste stream in itself we all we've

152
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,340
got carbon that can be reduced the

153
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,009
carbon footprint what is somewhat of a

154
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:47,739
new census is now a resource if you have

155
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,810
a digester and frankly we've found that

156
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,668
the amount of time needed to operate

157
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,310
this digester isn't a whole lot more

158
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:56,859
maybe another half hour a day more than

159
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,509
what we already had invested in handling

160
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,970
on the norm waste anyways this

161
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,800
originally was budgeted to cash flow and

162
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,930
now it's looking at one year of

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,780
operation it appears that it's exceeded

164
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,800
our expectations and the digester is one

165
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:13,569
of the technologies that can can make us

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,728
neighbor friendly community friendly and

167
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,709
environment-friendly by proactively

168
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:19,839
managing his farms waste stream through

169
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,489
the use of a digester Don is lowering

170
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,859
his farms methane emissions while

171
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,689
farming for energy digesters are well

172
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,340
suited for dairy farms but they are not

173
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,829
the only technology available to farmers

174
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,509
for farms without manure solar and wind

175
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:34,449
production can play a pivotal role in

176
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,038
reducing carbon emissions 35 miles north

177
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,800
of Stanley New York near the shores of

178
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:41,889
Lake Ontario chip Bailey to is farming

179
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,288
for energy this is my 30th year farming

180
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,848
since graduating from Cornell 1984 and

181
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:49,120
we have currently about a hundred and

182
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:51,819
sixty acres in apple production will be

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,439
grow about 24 different apple varieties

184
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,500
and we pick on average about a hundred

185
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,800
and sixty-five thousand bushels hundred

186
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,529
and sixty acres on top of that we're Net

187
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,319
Zero as far as our energy use the

188
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,409
Renewable change my wife Carl and I both

189
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:11,348
decided on together and my wife is a big

190
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,689
part of our business and meeting our net

191
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:15,399
zero energy goals is something that we

192
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,379
decided together and we're both

193
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,359
committed to I first began looking into

194
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,009
renewable energy in the fall of two

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,930
thousand and one long and short of it

196
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:29,199
from 2001 it took me until 2009 to get

197
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,240
that windmill up a month after I put up

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,349
the windmill we installer for solar

199
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,290
system week

200
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,230
kind of add on to that as we needed more

201
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,600
power to all our cold storages shop

202
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,520
labor camp facilities here on the farm

203
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,070
including my house is powered with

204
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,709
renewable energy and that reduces our

205
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,879
carbon footprint on an annual basis we

206
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:51,370
produce about a hundred and eighty

207
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,800
thousand kilowatt hours of power so that

208
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,259
would be enough roughly the power 18

209
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,879
homes on an annual basis we look

210
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:00,579
worldwide there's not enough water and

211
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,409
energy and food is right up there we

212
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,300
live in a plentiful land here but you

213
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,700
look worldwide there's definite

214
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,620
shortages so those three things I think

215
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,319
there's always going to be a demand for

216
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,470
and because we're a growing business

217
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,629
we've created our own demand so why not

218
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,310
produce it and you utilize it I mean

219
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,310
really when you look at what we're doing

220
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,620
growing apples we're taking the energy

221
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,470
from the Sun and producing a crop of

222
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,540
apples so really what we're doing is the

223
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,150
same thing with the solar panels we're

224
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,909
harvesting the sunshine with apples or

225
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:36,159
renewable energy anything in life is a

226
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:39,129
gamble and anything new you're going to

227
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,779
take some lumps over and that's why you

228
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:42,519
know I ended up calling it the bleeding

229
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,319
edge instead of the leading edge because

230
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,210
you're gonna you're going to get some

231
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,190
cuts and scrapes and bruises when you're

232
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:51,550
trying out these new things but is there

233
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:54,280
an economic benefit to going netzero I

234
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:56,139
would say yes it's just you got to

235
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,600
manage your own timeline as far as the

236
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:00,970
repayment but it is a cost that you are

237
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,930
going to pay to the power company every

238
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,120
month for the rest of your life you

239
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:08,679
don't want it to be a burden to your

240
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,320
business but I think that there is a way

241
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:14,739
and we've proven that here that you can

242
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,370
have it both ways and I think we have an

243
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,710
obligation as farmers &amp; for stewards of

244
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,570
the land to provide for the next

245
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,190
generation not just the next generation

246
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,250
of farmers but the next the next

247
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,990
generation through long-term planning

248
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,850
and careful management Chip and his

249
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,190
wife's orchard has become a local model

250
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,930
for renewable energy production so much

251
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,090
so that the community of Williamson New

252
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,799
York where the orchard is located has

253
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,960
embraced alternative energy at the

254
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,689
municipal level and committed itself to

255
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,910
going Net Zero it may not always be easy

256
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,920
but farmers like chip and dawn

257
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:50,169
found ways to reimagine the traditional

258
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,909
values of farming by incorporating new

259
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:54,039
technologies that promote their

260
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:57,059
businesses benefit their communities and

261
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,059
address climate change

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,059
you
