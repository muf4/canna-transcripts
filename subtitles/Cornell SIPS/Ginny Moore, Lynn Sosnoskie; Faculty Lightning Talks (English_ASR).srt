1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,400
University and today I I'll be giving a

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,798
a brief overview of the work that my lab

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,600
is doing on sustainable cropping systems

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,039
and plant breeding um and then I'll

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,160
focus in on a subset of the work that

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,800
we're doing on cover crops so as B

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,759
mentioned I'm housed in plant breeding

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,880
and genetics um but I also um work kind

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,640
of at the intersection of of agronomy

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,960
and agricology integrating some

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,320
management and um social science

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,799
questions along with the genetics and

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,119
breeding work um So within this kind of

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:46,399
broad topic area we work on several

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:49,759
different crops and cropping systems uh

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,280
including uh in including forages um

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,519
cover crops and some emerging real crops

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,239
so working on on dry beans and hemp AIT

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,760
um and some of the major thematic areas

21
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,358
that we work on

22
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,920
include the establishment phase of of

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,759
many of these crops um weed management

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,320
winter

25
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,319
hardiness organic systems multicrop

26
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,239
systems there's you know many many

27
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,359
others but those are some of the sort of

28
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,078
core themes that we're thinking about in

29
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,438
my lab um and working on these across

30
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,279
several of the different crops that we

31
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,319
work on so lots of interconnections

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,079
across the crops they not going to be

33
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,118
able to talk about all of these themes

34
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:33,758
and crops today U focusing in more on

35
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,478
cover crops so um yeah we we touch on a

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,719
lot of the big thematic areas within of

37
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,239
the cover crops that we work on so

38
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,640
across all of the cover crops we're

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,239
thinking about early Vigor and in that

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,439
establishment phase um with serial Ry in

41
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,920
particular we're focused on allopathy as

42
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,959
a weed management

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,240
tool um across all of the crops so we're

44
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,118
mostly focused on on winter annuals so

45
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,599
fall

46
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:01,118
planted um and so we care a lot about

47
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,679
winter survival and and in some cases

48
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:07,718
we're thinking also about um breeding

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,200
for tolerance to later planting dates um

50
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,878
and uh we do most of our breeding and

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,280
trials in organic

52
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,759
systems um as cover crops are an

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,159
especially important tool for organic

54
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:22,120
farmers uh and then we also are working

55
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,159
on um a lot on cover crop mixtures so we

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,480
plant a lot of our trials um in

57
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,959
multispecies mixtures because that's um

58
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,119
how a lot of farmers are using cover

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,560
crops so that's kind of the the big

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,120
picture of what we're thinking about in

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,800
cover crops um and before I get into

62
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,280
more of the nitty-gritty about how we

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,000
operate I just want to acknowledge the

64
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,560
efforts of the staff and graduate

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,199
students and the many undergraduates

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,719
that that come through our lab um I feel

67
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,759
really lucky to have um a super

68
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,919
hardworking and adaptable and

69
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,280
collaborative team that um yeah have

70
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,000
they've been really Nimble as we're

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,318
working on this huge range of of crops

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,959
and

73
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:08,479
systems um so uh the core of our our C

74
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,080
crop breeding work is is done through

75
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:15,079
the the cover crop breeding Network so

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,920
this is um a network uh of collaborators

77
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,920
across universities uh USDA AR research

78
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:26,679
stations uh and USDA nrcs plant material

79
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:30,039
centers um the network started in 2015

80
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,599
and was really motivated by um a of

81
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:35,679
breeding activity and named cultivars

82
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,959
available for cover crops um and we know

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
that cover crop adoption has been

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,560
steadily increasing over recent years um

85
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,518
but that most cover crops that are

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,680
planted on the landscape are variety not

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,680
stated so they haven't been um sort of

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,200
explicitly bred for specific breeding

89
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,079
objectives or or adaptation to specific

90
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,560
regions um and our premise with the

91
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,959
network is basically that that having

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,719
improved cultivars will um

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,400
uh improve the performance of cover

94
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,039
crops and support continued uh increases

95
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,280
in adoption of cover crops on the

96
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,438
landscape um so as I said the the work

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,039
started in

98
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,359
2015 um and Matt Ryan in in soil and

99
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,680
crop science has been part of the

100
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,799
network since the beginning um I joined

101
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,519
the network uh starting in 2019 I was

102
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:26,478
the the cover crop Network cord

103
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,959
coordinator um uh based out of a USDA

104
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,959
Research Center in Beltsville Maryland

105
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,799
um and then when I came to Cornell in

106
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,758
2021 I became the director of the

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,319
network um and sve Hansen is the current

108
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,400
Network coordinator she's a research

109
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,240
support specialist housed in my

110
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:47,159
lab uh

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,319
and um the network has been funded by

112
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,960
several different uh Grant programs over

113
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:56,240
the years the most um Central and most

114
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,000
important uh program for our network has

115
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,840
been the organic research and extension

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,759
initiative I'm so or I supported the

117
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,799
first grant that that started the

118
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,840
network in 2015 and has funded two

119
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,918
additional cycles of of Grants to um to

120
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,599
support the network since then um and

121
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:18,639
then we also currently have uh a bigger

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,039
uh sustainable egg systems cap Grant out

123
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,160
of USDA um and that's a a project that

124
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:27,360
includes our breeding work but is also

125
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,199
has a larger mission of increasing the

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,439
production of cover crop seed in the US

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,720
to support that um expanded adoption and

128
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,519
expanded Acres of cover crops that we're

129
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,360
seeing um

130
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,599
and so so since the Inception of the

131
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,960
network in 2015 so we we started out

132
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,319
working on three winter annual legum

133
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,198
species winter pea hary vet and crimson

134
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,080
clover um and then over time add

135
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,080
additional species so we now also work

136
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:00,519
on serial Ry and um on brasas uh

137
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:02,599
primarily winter canola and

138
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,120
um over that time period in addition to

139
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,759
expanding the number of species we've

140
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,560
also expanded the number of sites in the

141
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,319
network so as of this past year we have

142
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,160
let's see nine uh breeding locations

143
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,639
across the country and we also have two

144
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
farmer breeders that participate in the

145
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,360
network so they have breeding nurseries

146
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,120
on their farms in their based in the

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,400
Upper Midwest um we also have 14

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,720
Advanced line testing locations so

149
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,719
testing early generation breeding

150
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,960
material uh compared to commercial

151
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,319
checks and then as part of the new sasap

152
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:41,000
project we also have 12 locations that

153
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,439
are planting a variety trials that a

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,279
larger scale that are more um focused on

155
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,680
Commercial cultivars and and providing

156
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,359
recommendations to

157
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,519
Farmers um and this network represents

158
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,840
the first um n National effort to to

159
00:06:54,519 --> 00:07:02,079
breed cover crops and um it's I think

160
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,918
particularly important to mention um in

161
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,758
the current uh political climate um how

162
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,799
important USDA collaborators especially

163
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,680
have been in in the Inception and

164
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,960
continued success of the network so we

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
work very closely with ARs breeders who

166
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,359
who were involved in founding the

167
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,279
network and uh we also work super

168
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,879
closely with the the nrcs plant material

169
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,799
centers and if people are not familiar

170
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,840
with the

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,319
pmc's um

172
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,839
they're uh about two dozen locations

173
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,360
across the country in different Eco

174
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,159
regions and their mandate is to evaluate

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
plant materials that are useful for

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,039
conservation programs so that includes

177
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,598
cover crops but also um you know native

178
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,199
species things that are useful for for

179
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,598
uh restoration work things like that um

180
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,158
and they have been really critical in um

181
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,719
they they especially have contributed to

182
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,719
the advanced line testing program and

183
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,800
they several occasions are doing seed

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,319
yield trials and are providing seed

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,720
increase services for us so we have

186
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,759
enough seed to plant larger trials um

187
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,599
later in the breeding program so so

188
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,240
that's been a really critical role for

189
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:16,158
them um and okay so so next I I want to

190
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,879
talk about our breeding pipeline I know

191
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:19,800
that a lot of people here are not plant

192
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,639
breeders and and so I thought it would

193
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,598
be useful to talk about what that looks

194
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,519
like for us um okay great um so so I'll

195
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,240
go through this quickly but we so we

196
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,958
have um we start by sourcing germ plasm

197
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,080
from a variety of places and plant them

198
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,598
and breeding nurseries we have

199
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,278
preliminary uh trials that are single

200
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,879
row plots uh planted at a few locations

201
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:44,278
and over time we expand to more

202
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,759
locations and larger plots we also have

203
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:47,240
seed yield trials that we plant at

204
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,679
several different locations across the

205
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,278
country and then we're now at the stage

206
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,559
uh for a couple of our crops Harry vet

207
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,039
and winter pee that were um moving

208
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,919
towards variety release and working with

209
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,439
seed companies to make that happen um

210
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,399
and I also wanted to mention we have on

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,800
on firm trials as of this year 70

212
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,639
locations across the country we're doing

213
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:09,399
this uh using seed links which is a an

214
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,559
app uh to coordinate a participatory

215
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,559
variety trials and breeding and we're

216
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,119
planning to do more of that in the

217
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,479
future um mentioning briefly that we're

218
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,320
also doing some uh evaluation for

219
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,079
freezing tolerance in growth Chambers uh

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
don't have time to talk more in detail

221
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:30,039
about that but it's work that's being

222
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:33,679
led by uh my graduate student rakaa

223
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:35,199
um so evaluating tolerance to freezing

224
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,679
um in these and these are new chambers

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,120
that um were installed this fall in

226
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,239
Bradfield and that's been supported by

227
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,679
several grants including an equipment

228
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,120
Grant and S and uh the Northern New York

229
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,359
act development program and I'll I'll

230
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,639
wrap up by plugging a field day that

231
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,919
we're doing in late April um and this

232
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,319
will be uh hosted in conjunction with

233
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,039
the annual meeting for our Network and

234
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,839
so there'll be cover crop readers from

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,120
across the country here and you'll have

236
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,399
an opportunity to engage so I would

237
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,799
encourage you to come if you're

238
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,240
available and I'll leave it there thank

239
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,240
you question

240
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,759
for question the the gr chamber do they

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,679
allow to to

242
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,720
freeze the do they allow freezing yes

243
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,319
nice yeah yeah so so we wrote this

244
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,560
equipment Grant to install so we have

245
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,800
three chambers now that can go to

246
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,000
Sub-Zero temperatures and they are I

247
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,120
didn't have time to to talk more about

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,958
it but they they're um a shared use

249
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,000
resource so so my grand student is is

250
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,479
using the chambers monopolizing them a

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,879
little bit right now for her her

252
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,159
dissertation project but uh in the

253
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,679
future um I think starting summer

254
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,439
they'll be more available for other

255
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,719
folks to use

256
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,600
yeah okay so uh my name is Lind seski I

257
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,519
am out of the horiculture section in

258
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,800
Geneva New York at Cornell agretech and

259
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,839
I am uh the weed science extension

260
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,879
specialist

261
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,160
for uh fruit and vegetable production

262
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,799
here in New York state now when we talk

263
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,559
about weeds weeds are problematic for

264
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,319
lots of reasons we think about the

265
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,078
competitive interactions that interfere

266
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,639
with crop growth and yield production uh

267
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,319
but they're they're problematic for

268
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,560
other reasons including the fact that

269
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,720
they can serve as host for pests and

270
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,359
pathogens they can physically

271
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,360
contaminate our yields uh this is

272
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,839
nightshade berries they can be uh a

273
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,480
contaminant of peas and of Snappy which

274
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,399
Can U impact the ability to accept loads

275
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,519
at the um at the processors and then

276
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,799
they can actually interfere with

277
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,399
harvestability these are beets we can

278
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,958
actually have weeds that are in the row

279
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,440
with beets that can actually interfere

280
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,759
with the lifting and The Cutting process

281
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,880
which reduces Harvest efficiency now

282
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,720
we're frequently using herbicides for

283
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,759
weed control but we need to think about

284
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,560
why we need to adapt first and foremost

285
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,720
uh pesticide development is costly and

286
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,919
slow it can take hundreds of millions of

287
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,600
dollars in a decade uh or more to bring

288
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,879
a new molecule from Discovery to

289
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,440
commercialization talking with a senta

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,000
colleague and they said oh I might have

291
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,199
something for you to test next year

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,919
we're looking at

293
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:22,159
2035 for uh a product release there's uh

294
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,599
effects of export Market access using

295
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,719
certain herbicides might not allow us

296
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,839
access to say the European market

297
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,920
there's changing consumer perceptions

298
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,279
about pesticide use and then there's

299
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,719
worker protection and crop injury

300
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,919
concerns if anyone has been following

301
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,278
the uh epa's new strategy for dealing

302
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,198
with uh their obligations Under The

303
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,679
Endangered Species Act that's also going

304
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:50,559
to complicate our pesticide use and then

305
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,559
there's herbicide resistance and while

306
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,198
we think herbicide resistance is being

307
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,278
an issue in our agronomic crop

308
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:00,240
production systems we do have herbicide

309
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,000
resistant issues in vegetables as well

310
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
so speaking of herbicide resistance some

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,958
of the work that my lab does and I I do

312
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,919
do herbicide trials and evaluations for

313
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,278
companies for The Growers for the ir4

314
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,559
project but we also look at the impacts

315
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:17,240
of uh overuse of herbicides this is work

316
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,518
uh from my graduate student Aaliyah

317
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,639
Butler Jones this is her master's work

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,639
where we confirmed glyphosate resistance

319
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:27,399
in a new weed problem here in New York

320
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,278
state Palmer amaran uh it's a big

321
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,000
problem throughout the United States and

322
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,679
just started moving into the more

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,078
Northern latitudes so we published that

324
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,759
paper and we're working with Terry

325
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:41,719
basone Kyle Brun Haro and Jim poock uh

326
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,480
to now uh prepare the manuscript where

327
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,360
we're characterizing atrazine resistance

328
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,480
in these same populations and we'll be

329
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,639
working with vipin on resistance to the

330
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,320
ALS

331
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,120
chemistries besides Palmer Amar that was

332
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,639
primarily in our agronomic crop

333
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,480
production systems we do have again

334
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,480
herbicide resistance in our especially

335
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,879
crop systems this is a paper uh from my

336
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,839
graduate student Bethany Schultis

337
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,958
looking at horse weed origer on

338
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,680
canadensis in New York Vineyards and

339
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,919
Orchards a lot of The Growers in uh New

340
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,799
York um Orchards and Vineyards are not

341
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,120
comfortable using glyphosate because

342
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,039
they're concerned about crop injury so

343
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,639
some of them have switched to using

344
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:26,000
paraquat well the use of paraquat has

345
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:30,240
led to the uh the development of

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,919
paraquat resistance in our populations

347
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
this one here in the vineyard that's

348
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,159
actually at Cornell agretech I've been

349
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,719
spraying that with paraquat and they're

350
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,240
like it's not dying and I'm like I've

351
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,320
got a I got an explanation for that so

352
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,680
we do have paraquat resistance we also

353
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,879
have uh low levels of diquat resistance

354
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,679
that are evolving uh we're currently

355
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,919
working with Terry basone and Kyle Brun

356
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,719
Haro to uh characterize misot trione

357
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,838
resistance in um our horse weed

358
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:03,360
populations as well so why do we need to

359
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:05,399
look look ahead obviously you know I

360
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,278
we're not going to spray our way out of

361
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,958
our issue so we need to be thinking

362
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,759
about what's down the road what kind of

363
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,278
technology is available to us and

364
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,480
there's a lot of focus on novel weed

365
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,879
management uh tools such as robotic

366
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,159
weeders and the three that we're looking

367
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:25,399
at is electrical weeding with Oregon

368
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:28,519
State you see Davis uh Optical spraying

369
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,078
with ruers and then laser weeding uh

370
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,240
with r

371
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,559
University so electrical weeding uh it

372
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,759
everyone expects arcs and Sparks this is

373
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,719
actually my electrical weeder where

374
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,839
we're using the mechanical energy from

375
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,959
the tractor engine to power a generator

376
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,079
that charges the applicators and those

377
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,159
applicators is right up in the front you

378
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,439
can see the metal uh electrons basically

379
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,480
that flow of electricity generates heat

380
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,519
it disrupts cellular mechanisms leading

381
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,079
to tissue death and that includes some

382
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,198
crowns and Roots so this is electrical

383
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:04,399
weeding 24 hours after treatment and

384
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,599
then this is one week after treatment uh

385
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,000
my graduate student Aaliyah Butler Jones

386
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,278
has been looking at it uh in our Organic

387
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,519
Apple production and this is uh funded

388
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:17,318
by an organic um research and extension

389
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,440
initiative basically she wanted to

390
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,958
compare electrical weeding to uh a

391
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
commonly used practice such as

392
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,198
cultivation as well as organic

393
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,360
herbicides and the work she's been doing

394
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,639
basically shows is that we're getting

395
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,639
better weed control of our perennial

396
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,759
weed species using electrical weeding

397
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,799
compared to cultivation she's also done

398
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,879
some work stacking electrical weeding

399
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,719
with cultivation if we go in and do the

400
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,919
electrical weeding first and then come

401
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,120
back with cultivation we find we get

402
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,360
even better weed control and it's much

403
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,240
easier to run those cultivation events

404
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,079
she's still conducting research but

405
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,600
right now the data suggests we don't

406
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,439
have any kind of lasting impacts on the

407
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,759
soil biological communities such as U

408
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,919
micro diversity micro activity or soil

409
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,599
microarthropods we are doing targeted

410
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,000
spraying so Vision guided spraying work

411
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,599
uh this is some work that we started

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,078
doing in perennial crops specifically in

413
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,958
blueberries and grapes and we're using a

414
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,198
system called the weedit system from

415
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,400
agretech America basically it just uh

416
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,880
looks for uh chlorophyll fluoresence

417
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,079
when it has that near infrared signal it

418
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,480
just turns on the nozzles that are

419
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:34,119
associated with the location of where

420
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,759
that unwanted vegetation is in the field

421
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,319
and what we've shown is that it's

422
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,640
actually very effective in our our

423
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,119
grapes and our blueberries for

424
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,160
controlling weeds and we're really

425
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,839
interested in the technology because it

426
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,120
allows us to reduce the amount of

427
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,519
herbicide we're applying annually we

428
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,359
have that ability to reduce crop injury

429
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,440
potential that are associated with

430
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,879
postemergence applications because we

431
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,200
have less contact potential with the

432
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,240
crop we might be able to eval valuate

433
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,120
new herbicides that could control our

434
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,359
herbicide resistant weeds or those

435
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,239
perennial weeds because of this enhanced

436
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,879
safety and importantly I mentioned The

437
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,558
Endangered Species Act uh it uh using a

438
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,000
vision guided sprayer will be a

439
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,960
mitigation strategy for preventing

440
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,079
off-target herbicide movement that can

441
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,880
threaten endangered um that can impact

442
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,720
threaten and endangered species or their

443
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,320
critical habitat because we're applying

444
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,519
less herbicide to less Acres uh using

445
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,720
the technology we're also working with

446
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,879
Terry bits if we can see the weeds can

447
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,640
we see the crop and we've actually been

448
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,400
doing work with Terry bait saying you

449
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,799
know what we can actually use this weed

450
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,759
it sprayer to uh preferentially treat

451
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,000
suckers so they don't need to have

452
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,798
someone going around either putting you

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,558
know the herbicides on continuously

454
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,879
applying and and applying the herbicides

455
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:56,359
where we don't need it or having someone

456
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,320
with a wand having to go Vine to vine to

457
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,079
vine to vine to vine to spray them so

458
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,879
we're working on that publication for

459
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,960
Hort technology on our weed sucker

460
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,720
control our next step is actually

461
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,960
putting our weed it system our spray

462
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,798
system on a fully automated Little Robot

463
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,759
uh training it to where all the The

464
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,079
Vineyard rows are and sending it off to

465
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,079
do the whole process

466
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,119
automatically I'm we're getting into the

467
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,798
vision guided spraying in our vegetable

468
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,399
systems I have been bothering this

469
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,079
company for years verdant robotics

470
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,679
please bring a unit to New York please

471
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,839
bring a unit to New York please bringing

472
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,559
a unit to New York we really want to

473
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,279
test your unit because our Growers are

474
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,599
interested in it but I can't give them

475
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,200
guidance if I can't work with it and see

476
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:45,240
it so this is a really unique Vision

477
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,440
guided uh spray system it's uh obviously

478
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,120
it's it's it's a an AI uh based models

479
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,320
where it sees the crops and it sees the

480
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,119
weeds it discriminates between them but

481
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,000
rather than say like uh some of the

482
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,079
systems like the John Deere systems that

483
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,359
just has a bank of nozzles that turn on

484
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,599
and off

485
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,918
uh verdant robotics actually has an a

486
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,319
turret that can move and turn and focus

487
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,520
uh to direct a concentrated stream right

488
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,399
at the weeds and this is actually The

489
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,279
Verdant robotics unit operating uh in

490
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,200
organic carrots out in Bolt house farms

491
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,119
in California that's not lasers that's

492
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,919
actually just lights showing you how the

493
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,759
turrets are moving and targeting the

494
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,280
weeds and the little insert here you can

495
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:31,240
see exactly in these tiny little dark

496
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,119
patches how uh precise uh the herbicide

497
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,159
application is and we actually have one

498
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,279
grower in New York who is looking to

499
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,679
invest in this in

500
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,879
2025 but we're going to be speaking

501
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,919
about and and again verdant robotics has

502
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,120
agreed to bring a Research Unit this

503
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,919
summer for us to do some trials with but

504
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,558
if we want to talk about the biggest of

505
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,679
the big uh of uh AI technology and

506
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,158
targeted weed control that would be

507
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,840
carbon robotics they are the only

508
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,480
commercial laser weeding company in the

509
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,199
United States they were founded in 2018

510
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,880
they manufactured the units in Detroit

511
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,400
they launched in early 22 with their uh

512
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,559
the first version of their laser weeder

513
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,159
really looking at the large vegetable

514
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,158
growers in Arizona California the

515
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,840
western United States basically they use

516
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,640
high-intensity bed toop lighting to to

517
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,918
illuminate and and remove all the

518
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,000
Shadows so they get a clear view of all

519
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,240
the crops and the weeds and then uh they

520
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,880
with their AI deep learning models they

521
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,720
discriminate between them and then they

522
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,159
have uh 150 watt CO2 lasers they're

523
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,480
their newer editions are now 240 watt

524
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:44,440
dodes with a millimeter accuracy that

525
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,798
just shoot the weeds and I have a video

526
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,960
here that you can see basically that's

527
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:52,038
scanning the bed top and then all the

528
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,240
little pin points of light that is uh

529
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:56,119
the lasers actually targeting the

530
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,880
individual weeds in between the lettuce

531
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:02,519
plants and in the lower part you can see

532
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,919
basically the Precision of going after

533
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,519
uh meristematic and other

534
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,159
tissue we were very lucky to work with

535
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,038
their uh their research and demo unit

536
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,039
that was the one that was in operation

537
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:18,359
in the previous slide so we uh conducted

538
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,798
trials in New York in New Jersey uh we

539
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,319
looked at Laser weeding uh I purposely

540
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:26,480
looked at beets spinach and peas and we

541
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:29,558
compared lasure weeding to um a commonly

542
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,440
used pre-emergence herbicide uh esor

543
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:34,839
also known as dual Magnum we looked at

544
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,840
the laser weeding alone or with the uh

545
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,480
in in partnership with the Dual Magnum

546
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,359
and what I want you to focus on is look

547
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,839
at the difference in the crop sizes not

548
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,798
so much the P we didn't have differences

549
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,599
but we in this trial one of the things

550
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,798
we were really able to see is how much

551
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,918
under our growing conditions the Dual

552
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,960
Magnum held our crops back our small

553
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,520
seated crops back we actually had really

554
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,919
warm temperatures and really intense

555
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,158
down pores that led to crusting and

556
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,120
because the Dual Magnum was actually

557
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,840
holding back the beets and the spinach

558
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,479
from uh the the

559
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,319
emergence uh they weren't able to break

560
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,159
out of the crust as easily they also

561
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,720
took up the herbicide and it resulted in

562
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
season long stunting in these crops now

563
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,880
this isn't necessarily out of the

564
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,599
ordinary isn't a function of me we had

565
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,919
several Growers who had to replant

566
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,439
Fields last year for this exact same

567
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,799
reason we found that the laser weeding

568
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,159
was as effective as our herbicide

569
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,639
applications for early season weed

570
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,679
control and like I said we got that

571
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,360
boost in the crop Vigor uh in the

572
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,360
absence of the pre-emergence herbicide

573
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,199
Terry got similar results in New Jersey

574
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,599
and we're currently preparing this for

575
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,038
Pest Management science we've also

576
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,319
leverage this for a moonshot grant uh

577
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,158
Brian n Christy hting and we're working

578
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,119
with Tor Farms to see if we can kill

579
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,480
many birds with one stone using laser

580
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:59,558
weeder the Tories have two commercial

581
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,079
laser weeders um which come in at a $1.6

582
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:05,119
million each uh but basically we know

583
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:07,480
that laser weeding can affect weed

584
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,759
control uh we also know it can improve

585
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,480
crop Viger so if we can improve onion

586
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,278
Vigor by taking some of the more

587
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,720
injurious onion herbicides out of the

588
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:19,319
program uh can we also potentially

589
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,679
reduce thrips damage and then uh the

590
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,439
incidence of and severity of stem filum

591
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,080
Leaf blight the last thing I'll talk

592
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,399
about is uh you know technology is great

593
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,918
but we have to ask a lot of question

594
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,239
questions about it technology doesn't

595
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,480
absolve us from being uh good weed

596
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,480
managers being good Farm managers being

597
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,278
good stewards these tools and

598
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,519
Technologies are going to impart

599
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,159
selection pressures on our weed

600
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,240
community so we we need to be aware of

601
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,760
who wins because someone always wins and

602
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,038
it's not us uh we have to think about

603
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,519
costs the units themselves but also

604
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,038
parts and services and then adoptability

605
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,200
we are not a small California the other

606
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,519
thing I'll say is we have to really talk

607
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,240
about infrastructure and Regulatory

608
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:07,599
Readiness uh our technology is advancing

609
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,798
a lot faster uh than say the EPA can

610
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,599
keep up with writing herbicide labels so

611
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,440
I just want to thank my lab and I want

612
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,199
to thank all the funding sources that

613
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,200
are supporting our

614
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:24,079
research this has been a production of

615
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:27,080
Cornell University on the web at

616
