1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,290
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:05,290
University

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:15,308
Thank You Kristen it's a pleasure to see

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:18,710
you all today I am going to talk about

5
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:21,230
some of my connection to work in the the

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,810
farm-to-table movement part of why it's

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,179
really special to me I grew up my family

8
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:29,778
has a farm not too far down the road

9
00:00:26,178 --> 00:00:32,810
from Cornell and so working on that from

10
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:37,519
Cornell has a great special resonance

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:42,829
with me and thinking about kind of why

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,760
arm to table matters thinking about the

13
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,949
importance of food to us as we have

14
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:52,489
throughout humanity celebrated harvests

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,410
express our gratitude for food or mend

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,870
the meals that bring us together the

17
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:58,879
meals you'll have here at reunion will

18
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:02,000
be kind of your gathering points food

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,800
has been really a central event and

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,019
sharing food has been a central event

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:10,939
for our lives and as we have in the past

22
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:13,689
two generations one of the tendencies

23
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,189
we've seen is for people to be bit more

24
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:18,259
disconnected for that and one of the

25
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,989
movements we see is people being very

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,060
interested in reconnecting with where

27
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:25,339
their food comes from we see more young

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,519
young farmers getting engaged with

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,219
agriculture again we see other people

30
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,519
just wanting to be connected to the

31
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,260
process other people just looking to see

32
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,959
no more where is the food coming from

33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,320
feel more connected to that experience

34
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,919
and so as we have started to have this

35
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,978
movement this reappraise or connecting

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,280
with food and how it's grown and can be

37
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:54,799
grown locally sourced locally and feel

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,930
more kind of connected to the process

39
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,430
it's something that helps build and

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:04,670
empower communities and new varieties

41
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,890
new cultivars to help that is one of the

42
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,360
areas I contribute if we extend beyond

43
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,348
that but it's one of the areas is the

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,590
most personal and special to me and in

45
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:18,560
that process look beyond just looking to

46
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,280
benefits to create new varieties for

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,039
a farm for a grower for the food system

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,759
a critical thing is the consumer from

49
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,969
the food system all of us and how can we

50
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,370
empower us to be navigating that with

51
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:37,180
the choices that we're wanting to make

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,340
trying to make taking about freshness

53
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,010
nutrition sustainability all the choices

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,500
we make how do we how do we find our way

55
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,959
through the fruits and with so many new

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,780
crops so many opportunities to give food

57
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,580
some advertising a produce how do we

58
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,459
know that we're making the choices we

59
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,830
think we're making and so my apologies

60
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,719
for anyone that has any memories of

61
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,860
taking multiple choice tests in this

62
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:06,289
room before in Calcutta durian but this

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,459
is the test the the choice you might

64
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:13,009
have in the market place is looking

65
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,680
between these two squash and which one

66
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:19,030
is the righteous which one is the most

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,769
nutritious one of them happens to be

68
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,219
ripe and ready for the market and the

69
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:27,019
other one is not ready so how do you

70
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:31,459
tell which one is the most delicious

71
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:33,500
most nutritious so how about if through

72
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,769
plant breeding we can change the

73
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,409
question and make it an easier question

74
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:43,519
so now a and B which one is the ripe

75
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:46,449
Asst so this is a honey nut squash one

76
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,030
of the products I've helped develop and

77
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,250
so clearly B is the ripe one it has a

78
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,009
rightness indicator so like a green

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,739
versus a yellow banana a green versus a

80
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,298
red tomato this rightness indicator it

81
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,670
empowers you to go through the grocery

82
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,769
store to find or the market to be able

83
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,919
to find the produce that's the ripe fost

84
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,569
that'd be the most delicious it is also

85
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,458
not only can you tell when it's right

86
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:13,488
that's naturally more nutrition has more

87
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:17,090
vitamin A a great antioxidant for your

88
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:20,060
health provide M&amp;A so the honey o squash

89
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:23,239
all the way on your right B will have

90
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,639
three times the beta carotene content

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,370
this provitamin a activity as the

92
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,600
ripeness of the squash in your left in

93
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,139
ten

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,650
as much as you would find on the less

95
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:38,149
ripe one you see and so this gives you a

96
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,849
way to be to find some that's going to

97
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:44,509
be delicious when you bring it home to

98
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,970
your family when you grow it and along

99
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:50,000
with that you get the the flavor the

100
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,860
nutrition and not only is it something

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
that it's helping some farms to be able

102
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,970
to have an identifiable product where

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,040
they can kind of guarantee the quality

104
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,160
and you can understand that what you're

105
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,740
getting it also helps people change some

106
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,180
of their dietary choices because rather

107
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,319
than going through the produce and

108
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,150
finding some things maybe not to your

109
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,649
taste maybe you can get them at their

110
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,539
peak and maybe this is going to

111
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:17,000
influence how much of it you can eat and

112
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,810
have all these great plant nutrients in

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,810
your diet so this has been a novel thing

114
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:27,740
that wasn't a very fast initially to get

115
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,829
into marketplace luckily I have a great

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,750
ally in this process so I am very

117
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:35,180
fortunate to work with a renowned

118
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,240
farm-to-table chef dan barber one of the

119
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,090
world leaders in this and as we started

120
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,540
to develop this in terms of co-creation

121
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:48,739
of this new squash it was working with

122
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,960
him in the fields as an opportunity to

123
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,439
taste together see the techniques how we

124
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:57,049
get the most flavor out of it up here is

125
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,790
the four I was sadly to Instagram a

126
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,189
while ago so I started to eat it before

127
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,830
taking the picture where you see this

128
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:06,560
beautiful small squash something that's

129
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:10,519
convenient that fits and some family

130
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,709
sizes nowadays is able to be more of a

131
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,180
side dish rather than kind of filling up

132
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,479
the dishes concentrating the flavor

133
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,680
concentrating the nutrition and also one

134
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,500
of the things that does it we realized

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,199
at the time is on the plate it can

136
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,759
resemble what it looks like in the field

137
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,639
and so it's really bringing some of that

138
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,959
field present to you on the plate and so

139
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,680
that's kind of some of the farm-to-table

140
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:36,169
connection it can make and it has

141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,590
received a lot of popularity it's been

142
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,910
described in many food magazines media

143
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:42,649
and I've seen

144
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,670
from seeing I was talking about a

145
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:48,979
Netflix and a great documentary also

146
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,620
it's achieved one of the things that is

147
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,410
two vegetables get to have apples will

148
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,149
know by variety name you might be going

149
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,570
to the orchards and homecoming in the

150
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:01,039
fall be getting a Snapdragon Apple so

151
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,959
this is a butternut squash is actually

152
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,290
sold by name not just a butternut squash

153
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:10,609
but honey nut squash and as we've

154
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,730
continued to go along there's been a lot

155
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,530
we can do to make the food we have

156
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,300
available to us we the farms they can

157
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,979
grow up forth more exciting more

158
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,829
distinctive to be able to really

159
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,040
showcase what we're developing give

160
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:29,120
consumers give all of us a new flavors

161
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,060
to try we've been in many of the seed

162
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,970
catalogs you'll see this year there's

163
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,269
the white cucumber behind me martini

164
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,360
that has also a fantastic yield for the

165
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:43,310
grower and a much more delicious refined

166
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,370
flavor than many other cucumbers you'll

167
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,009
have the Havana the pepper which is a

168
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,560
habanero pepper with the spice removed

169
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,089
but it keeps the flavor of a habanero

170
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,430
peppers you can experience all those

171
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:57,439
flavors without the burn and so it's a

172
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,120
great way to see all the steps of flavor

173
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,819
that's in the produce around us and some

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,800
diversity to really help make some of

175
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,290
the produce more competitive with some

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,110
of the other food choices we have and we

177
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,950
can continue to to push this and work

178
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,290
for some more ornamental edibles and try

179
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,800
to get peppers that are both loaded with

180
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,140
vitamin C and are just a nice snack size

181
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,840
so it's a more convenient way to go to

182
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:28,039
be eating delicious you know hopefully

183
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,109
compelling produce and also a plant that

184
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,659
even as an ornamental and it works in

185
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,418
many more areas and we might have

186
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,159
available to grow food for those of us

187
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:41,779
that might have to have more of a

188
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,689
balcony space than a garden space and so

189
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,230
in this process as I continue to be

190
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,930
really excited about this co-creation of

191
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,920
this avant-garde produce new exciting

192
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:56,349
increasing the flavor

193
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,169
and the appeal of that and making a more

194
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,839
noticeable and transcends enjoying

195
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:04,689
seeing farmers it incorporates this into

196
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,399
other growing I had started to really

197
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,839
think this is what farm-to-table was

198
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,789
about to be able to get all these great

199
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,910
new exciting things for the farmers to

200
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:15,789
grow and if I was fortunate that again

201
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:17,980
this is where chef Barbara came in to

202
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:20,049
correct me and they will no not about

203
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,399
that you know so we're supporting the

204
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:26,039
food system and it's also is really

205
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,769
about trying to figure also

206
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,659
farm-to-table and so what do the farms

207
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,850
have what is the best way to support the

208
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:35,500
bounty that's there sustainably on the

209
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,560
farm and how do we integrate that into

210
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:42,370
our diet into what's being served and

211
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,409
showed and celebrated and so I found

212
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,799
myself in some interesting breeding

213
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:50,230
projects at the end of the season the

214
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,289
beginning of the season before you are

215
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,149
having a harvest from a field or right

216
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:59,289
before the frost like this is in this

217
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:01,179
top panel and you've gotten all the the

218
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:04,120
right produce that there is out of the

219
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:07,569
field there's still a lot in the field

220
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,360
in many cultures outside the US they

221
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,860
would be looking at how they can avoid

222
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,230
wasting all of this it's something that

223
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,639
we are starting to tackle is how to look

224
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,339
at food waste and so the project they

225
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,990
kind of evolved into is looking at the

226
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:27,100
CEO to figure out well here's a field of

227
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,500
squash all this foliage that's left it

228
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,940
could just be something that we could

229
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,708
incorporate into our cuisine adapt to

230
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,949
our environment what some other cultures

231
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:40,750
do so although I've spent much of my

232
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:42,789
time here selecting for the tastiest

233
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,089
squash I found myself going through the

234
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:48,698
field finding the tastiest squash stems

235
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,500
and joy looking for something that we

236
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:54,490
can get this other food that kind of

237
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,970
fits have Dan's vision and so we ended

238
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:01,509
up with actually a delightful squash

239
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,910
penne pasta so it's gluten free it

240
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,700
exists comes right from the plant the

241
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:09,699
the squash plant but it

242
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,920
something that is abundant throughout

243
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:16,090
the field throughout the season and is

244
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,279
something that is nutritious and fitting

245
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,230
right into another use of farm can have

246
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,659
for much of what it's already producing

247
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,639
that otherwise be wasted

248
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,379
some of the challenges some of you might

249
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,139
be close to experiencing some of these

250
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:31,240
it burns at home the dreaded to come

251
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:33,519
bird beetles as they come in the squash

252
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,279
especially and as they do fully the

253
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,980
squash there are some different controls

254
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,600
we can use an insecticide that now we

255
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,210
are trying to discuss more about how

256
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,580
they may be or impacting pollinator

257
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,040
health and so looking at ways to avoid

258
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,560
that it turns out there's some natural

259
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,990
diversity within squash we can start to

260
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,449
leverage and use to be able to create

261
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,340
squash the beetles will leave along that

262
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,670
we will still find tasty but the beetles

263
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,820
will find it tasteful and it's as simple

264
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:07,000
as see a golden zucchini here that the

265
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,920
beetles will perfectly ravage and a

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,590
straight neck or crookneck summer squash

267
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,829
that they leave alone so for me as a

268
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,450
plant breeder it is as simple as

269
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,490
crossing the two of them together of

270
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,560
cross-pollination and then going through

271
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,840
the generations to be able to find rice

272
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,159
and emerge the best of all those

273
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,030
characteristics towards a more

274
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,159
sustainable harvest however that's not

275
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:33,459
the only insect threat out there and

276
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,860
talking to growers in the southeast who

277
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,710
have given up growing zucchini as we're

278
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,830
about to be flooded with zucchini you

279
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:45,250
can kind of imagine what threat they

280
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,870
must be to not produce Metheny so but

281
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,759
there's other squash squash that are

282
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,129
naturally resistant to some of the other

283
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,580
tests insects we might experience in

284
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:56,679
your garden and your fields in your farm

285
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,540
so above me here is a Trump and Shino

286
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,609
squash an Italian heirloom squash

287
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:03,939
selected for flavor that you don't see

288
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,909
much in the marketplace and so as I try

289
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,630
to work a Dan to how can we adapt this

290
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:14,230
to some some of other ways of cooking

291
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:16,960
and preparation and also to make it more

292
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,509
delicious and sustainable through a

293
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,579
variety of taste tests we are able to

294
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:25,759
science on my breeding lines that are

295
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:29,419
excelling in the kitchen and are

296
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:32,509
delicious and sustainable on the plate

297
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:34,610
and so that's really what much of the

298
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,429
farm-to-table on the farm to fork

299
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,850
movement have meant to me it's both

300
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:44,000
trying to create new varieties to really

301
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,620
excite us in nourish us and when we can

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,990
find them and incorporate them into our

303
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,028
diets more and more out of just natural

304
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,519
beyond like we should be eating these

305
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:55,129
things more but a drive and desire to

306
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,230
eat them more and also ensuring that

307
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,000
we're also really about the farmer the

308
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,610
grower and how we can take things that

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,208
are thriving for them and incorporate

310
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:13,820
that into our vision and plan for this

311
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:16,278
new cuisine thank you this has been a

312
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:21,070
