1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,879
University and I wanted to start with

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,000
particularly agricultural historians uh

4
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:23,320
are often uh will indicate that plows

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,640
are one of the markers of of a civilized

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,198
agriculture in more developed

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,120
agriculture uh this first is a quote

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,600
from um HT who is a an American

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,280
Agricultural historian and you say you

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,359
see here his quote you know Through the

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,799
Ages the plow has been the most

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,000
important agricultural tool indeed

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,599
without it Farmers could not till the

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,799
soil and prepare their fields for

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,558
extensive agriculture but even um more

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,439
closer to home our own liberty Hyde

17
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,399
Bailey said um that tillage is so

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:01:00,198
Universal and so obviously essential to

19
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,239
successful agriculture that we accept it

20
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,359
without questioning its origin yet among

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,840
modern Farmers tillage is rarely

22
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,920
practiced with sufficient frequency to

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,920
produce the best

24
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,799
results but prior to colonization

25
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:22,200
farmers in the Western Hemisphere had no

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,079
access to plows nor to to draft animals

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,640
and yet they had very um both extensive

28
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,158
and intensive agriculture that was

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,680
accomplished completely by hand and I

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,719
show you three pictures here one from

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,399
Machu picu of Incan agriculture on

32
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:42,560
Terraces um another two from Mayan and

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,560
also Aztec agriculture um again

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,920
intensive agriculture but without Plows

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,519
in involved the last picture in in the

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,719
corner the the black and white is a

37
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:59,478
drawing by a Jesuit um who was visiting

38
00:01:54,718 --> 00:02:02,158
Mohawk country um in the 17th century

39
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:06,200
and this is a picture of a mohawk woman

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,000
with a hand tool also probably planting

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,439
corn um so what I wanted to do this

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,759
afternoon we have a a unique opportunity

43
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:18,479
to look at the effects of tillage um in

44
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,598
one place over several hundred years

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,479
both agriculture with and without

46
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:27,518
tillage right here in kind of Western

47
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,199
New York but I want to start out with

48
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,080
the Mohawks who were growing uh born

49
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,759
over closer to the Hudson Valley and

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,719
this is a a quote um in a journal by a

51
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:44,000
Dutchman um Adrian cornelison vanderdonk

52
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:48,239
and he was in the Hudson Valley in

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,199
1653 and he says he wrote in his report

54
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,039
um the women do all the farming and

55
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,518
planting they grow no wheat oats barley

56
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,039
Ry Etc and are unacquainted with plowing

57
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,519
and Spade work and do not keep their

58
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,079
lands TI

59
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,400
they know nothing of manuring fow

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,480
seasons and proper the labor they devote

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,120
is all manual using small adses

62
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,518
nevertheless they raise so much corn and

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,519
beans that we purchase these from them

64
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,640
in fully loaded yachts and sloops so

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,120
there is this indication of a productive

66
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,079
agriculture taking place um here in what

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,519
is today New York State um that was done

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,599
completely

69
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,120
plows and other types of mechanized or

70
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,119
major tillage

71
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,360
operations so I'd like to examine that

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,879
in in more detail and for those of you

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,519
who are not familiar with the Mohawks

74
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,840
the Mohawks were one of the original

75
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,519
five nations of the uray Confederacy and

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,920
the map on the on the right shows you

77
00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:00,519
what those territories look like

78
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:04,078
um about 1650 and the map on the left

79
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,599
um shows the iroy iroan language

80
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,920
speakers the the kind of dark purple um

81
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,238
the iray confederacies we know them

82
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,158
we're part of a larger group of native

83
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,478
peoples who spoke similar language

84
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,879
called the Iran languages and this is

85
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,680
what it might have looked like before

86
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:25,560
Europeans first came so you see people

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,879
of similar language the the dark purple

88
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,120
inhabiting or um residing in a fairly

89
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:36,319
large of of the Northeast certainly all

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:40,120
of of New York

91
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,038
um but let let me go back once more here

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,399
so I talked about the Mohawks and the

93
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:47,399
Mohawks were where we saw the the first

94
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,560
quote of about how their agriculture was

95
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,959
productive even though they knew nothing

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,240
of plows or manures or Fallows or

97
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,120
anything else but we're going to move

98
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,360
west over into

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:04,280
kuga and also Sena territory

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,680
this this is a a map of iroise

101
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:11,519
settlements um that were in existence

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,199
sometime between 1350 to 1730 and what

103
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,279
I've done just for your kind of

104
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,120
orientation is to place itha Geneva and

105
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,719
Rochester anma now the triangles that

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,959
are dark um are ones that were before um

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,759
1550 and the ones that are um light

108
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,000
colored are those that were occupied

109
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,639
after

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,240
1550 agriculture in iry communities

111
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,360
intensified um sometime about 1450 and

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,360
onward and what we we see is um there

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:50,240
was a a kind of concentration of many

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,360
settlements along that kind of east west

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,879
axis and let me show you a little bit

116
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,680
more of this if we look at where the iry

117
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,918
settlements were and where most of the

118
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,240
culture was taking place it's in this

119
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,279
broad area outlined in in red here that

120
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,960
happens to contain some of New York's

121
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:15,198
most agriculturally productive land um

122
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,159
if we look at irin maze um and how it

123
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
was managed we know that it was

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,160
controlled by women that the crops were

125
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,038
planted without plows there are no draft

126
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
animals that the fields were

127
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:30,038
continuously cropped and that it was a

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,840
highly productive agriculture

129
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:34,680
so you might say well what evidence do

130
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,918
we have of that productivity well they

131
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,959
come from two areas first historical

132
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,079
documents um the book on the right

133
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,560
General John Sullivan's Indian

134
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,318
expedition of

135
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,560
1779 contains uh lots of the Diaries and

136
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,598
journals of officers involved in the

137
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,160
Sullivan Campaign which came up into

138
00:06:54,598 --> 00:07:01,279
kuga and Sena territories we also have

139
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,360
available some field experiments that

140
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,959
that I've done that have looked at uh

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,560
what crop yields might have been but

142
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:13,159
let's look first at these historical

143
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,280
documents and they come from two primary

144
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,039
areas um both of them as a result of

145
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,918
European attacks particularly on cica

146
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,719
territories in both the 17th and 18th

147
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,758
you know um centuries and both of these

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,360
these incidents these two historical

149
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,439
incidents about aund years apart provide

150
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,598
us a lot of information on May

151
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:40,160
productivity the first one is Denville

152
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:44,360
this the guy up there 1687 a Frenchman

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,319
he goes into um gandan that's the one in

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,560
blue there that's located um if you've

155
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,520
been to the ganigan historical site in

156
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,240
in Western New York in Victor New York

157
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,198
it's just south of Rochester this was

158
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,879
one of the major

159
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,520
iry major

160
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,158
actually senica settlements at at that

161
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:09,959
time um and then Sullivan a hundred

162
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:12,038
years later um went all around uh kuga

163
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,680
lake senica lake and but more

164
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:17,878
specifically over into the western part

165
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,280
of New York through canona and uh one of

166
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:25,280
the major areas called genesy

167
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:28,799
Castle well let's first look at Denville

168
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,158
and this is a map that was made um after

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,839
his this time it it actually has

170
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,879
Sullivan's campaign on it as well but he

171
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,640
came down from the Lake

172
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:43,278
Ontario through this area what today is

173
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:47,559
is Rochester and then he began marching

174
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,559
a quite a large army um down into senica

175
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,719
um territories and the reason for doing

176
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,479
this was that the the senica were

177
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,800
collaborating and Allied themselves with

178
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,600
Great Britain and France and Great

179
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,519
Britain were at War over who was going

180
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,959
to control North America and Denville

181
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,519
knew that the senica had large fields of

182
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,359
corn and that they were supplying

183
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,159
British troops with corn so he was

184
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,560
coming down in order to try to destroy

185
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:20,719
and to um to frighten intimidate and

186
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,958
reduce the capacity of these Sena um you

187
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,440
know Villages from

188
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:31,359
providing um English Soldiers with with

189
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,120
food and so Ganan was the of of a major

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,639
um Grainery storage area and was kind of

191
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:42,360
the heart of of S ma agriculture well

192
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:45,000
Danville reported in letters back to his

193
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,320
you know superiors in France that over

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,120
nine days he and his men destroyed over

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,200
a million bushel of corn and that it was

196
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,200
both stored corn and corn that was Green

197
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,920
in the field and you can see what what

198
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,879
he writes here about after having

199
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,278
destroyed a vast quantity of fine large

200
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,958
corn beans and other vegetables of which

201
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:09,278
they remained not a single field and

202
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,958
after having burned so large a quantity

203
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,559
of old corn that would be stored corn

204
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,599
that the amount dare not be mentioned

205
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,919
the quantity of corn which we found in

206
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,879
store in this place and destroyed by

207
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,879
fire is

208
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,879
incredible all right so we have one

209
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:35,479
picture of a fairly detailed description

210
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:38,278
of what agriculture looked like in major

211
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,440
senica um areas where they were growing

212
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:43,838
corn about a hundred years later John

213
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,600
Sullivan comes into almost the exact

214
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,519
same area but he makes a much more

215
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:54,399
extensive um trip through Central and

216
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:58,879
and Western New York and he was ordered

217
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:03,278
by by George Washington um who gave him

218
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:07,120
these instructions in a letter in early

219
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:09,799
1779 in May of 1779 and he writes that

220
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,799
the immediate objectives are the total

221
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:16,120
Destruction and Devastation of their

222
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:19,359
settlements meaning primarily Sena anaga

223
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,560
and Kuka it will be essential to R their

224
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,759
crops in the ground and prevent their

225
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,359
planting more and the reason for this

226
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:31,720
once again was that the majority of the

227
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,560
iroy um out of six nations had sided

228
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,120
with Great Britain in the Revolutionary

229
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,518
War so once again they were supplying

230
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,120
British soldiers with corn so Sullivan

231
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,399
is is ordered to go up into this area

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,759
and Destroy Villages and the crops and

233
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,360
these little doted lines show

234
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,360
um where where he went they're actually

235
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,120
a couple of them came Clinton came from

236
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,399
this direction Sullivan came farther

237
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,519
from farther south in you know

238
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,159
Pennsylvania they went up this would be

239
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,720
kuga Lake and senica Lake first going up

240
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,120
along the the Eastern side of Sena going

241
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,360
all the way out west to what is today

242
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,360
Geno coming back down along the western

243
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,639
side of kuga Lake and then up up up

244
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,959
along the Eastern side um and all of the

245
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:26,039
time um burning Villages and more

246
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:30,518
importantly destroying corn fields well

247
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:33,000
out of this this campaign we have the

248
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,440
Diaries and journals of a number of the

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,039
officers who participated in this

250
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,920
campaign and I've just picked out um I

251
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:46,120
think there's six here five um that all

252
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:50,360
are from late August and they were in

253
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:55,000
primarily um areas around jio a little

254
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:59,199
to the east of you know jio Cana um and

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,480
and a bit farther west um and the these

256
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,120
you know officers describe the corn that

257
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,879
that they saw the agriculture that they

258
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,919
saw and you see the the quotes 150 acres

259
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,679
of the best corn I ever saw um in such

260
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,399
quantities would be almost incredible to

261
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:19,479
a civilized people some corn stalks

262
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,720
measuring 18 ft and a cobs one one foot

263
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,920
and a half long uh we found 200 Acres of

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,879
exceedingly good corn intermixed with

265
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:31,000
beans and squashes pompion and a few

266
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:32,919
potatoes we we destroyed large fields of

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,799
their corn they plant with as much

268
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:39,039
exactness as any farmer so a very

269
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:41,078
detailed picture of a productive and

270
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,120
extensive agriculture these are not

271
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:47,000
backyard gardens these are large

272
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,159
agricultural Fields 100 150 acres 200

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,559
Acres um sometimes there were there

274
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,519
there were um there were records or

275
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:58,399
quotes from these officers that they

276
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:03,000
went they saw corn fields that were more

277
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,958
than a m in length so huge amount of of

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,559
you know agriculture going on and

279
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:13,399
obviously indicative of of a of a fairly

280
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,879
productive and high yielding agriculture

281
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,078
so that's part of what the information

282
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,600
from historical documents tells us but

283
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,078
we also have some from field experiments

284
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,560
and this is work that I started back in

285
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:31,958
1993 and carried through till 1997 we

286
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:35,399
did it at two sites uh one right in this

287
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:38,078
area in kuga County at the musra

288
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,399
research farm and the other outside of

289
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:44,919
this very highly you know productive

290
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:49,839
area in Tomkins County on a farm about

291
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:51,958
um eight miles east and south of of itha

292
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,199
um today I'm just going to show you the

293
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:58,758
the results from kuga um because I think

294
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,879
they are most you know representative of

295
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,519
what

296
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,639
of what YY Farmers would have been able

297
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,759
to achieve um since they're in the same

298
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,919
area same climate same soils so we used

299
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,079
a maze variety uh an open pollinated

300
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:17,439
white flour corn that is still grown by

301
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,638
by iroy people today um from everything

302
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,320
that we know it is very similar to what

303
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:26,519
was grown here probably in the 15 16 17

304
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,278
and 1800s so it's quite similar it's an

305
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,799
open pollinated variety has a much lower

306
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,000
potential to do our our modern hybrids

307
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,318
and we used agronomic practices that

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,278
were as similar as we could make them to

309
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:41,759
what the iroy would have used in the

310
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,399
17th and 18th centuries we tried for

311
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,959
populations and for spacing we did some

312
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,879
some variations but we tried for for

313
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,919
things that we thought would would be

314
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,198
realistic so these are from two years in

315
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:59,039
kuga county and we had two different

316
00:15:54,198 --> 00:16:02,240
populations 10,000 and 20,000 plants um

317
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:05,719
per per acre and we planted them at two

318
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,159
different spacings one a 40 in and a 60

319
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,399
in and what we found in both years was

320
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,879
that the highest yields not surprisingly

321
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,480
came from the narrow spacing and the

322
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,958
high population and so at the very

323
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,879
highest yields we were getting um close

324
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:24,239
to 75 bushels per acre right and the

325
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,799
Very lowest at the in 96 at 10,000

326
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:32,159
plants and a and a wide spacing about 35

327
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,879
38 bu acre so we saw that as as uh

328
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:38,360
there's all sorts of indications that

329
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:41,318
the ID um planted at fairly um High

330
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,079
populations um so my guess is that the

331
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:47,399
the you know 40 in and 20,000 plants per

332
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:49,958
acre is probably realistic and so

333
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:54,839
somewhere between 50 to 75 bushels per

334
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:57,599
acre um is probably a a fairly typical

335
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,040
yield so the question immediately is are

336
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,278
these yields realistic um is are you

337
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:05,318
know talking about 50 to 75 bushs per

338
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:09,078
acre of of you know iroy corn how does

339
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:12,639
this match up um with with what we we

340
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,918
now well we have plenty of records that

341
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,439
under good Management Open pollinated

342
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,079
maze in the United States in the 19th

343
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,798
and early early 20th centuries

344
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:27,038
frequently yielded 75 to 100 Bush parade

345
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:29,558
but the important words there are good

346
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,558
management and these were fields that

347
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:35,440
were even in fact we have records of 200

348
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,079
bushel per acre in the 19th century in

349
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,558
New York state and open pollinated corn

350
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,558
right but these are in fields that were

351
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,440
either newly opened meaning they had not

352
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,399
been previously cultivated or they had

353
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
been rotated and or received

354
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,559
applications

355
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,558
of of animal

356
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,960
waste but many people in the field

357
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,360
of um particularly

358
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:11,200
anthropology um would would find fault

359
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:14,279
with this right uh if you look in in the

360
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,120
literature um of what yields are

361
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:21,798
purported to be amongst Native Americans

362
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:25,000
in both um generally North America but

363
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:27,639
more specifically in Easter Eastern and

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,960
Central North America their yields are

365
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,400
much much lower they estimate the yields

366
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,759
to have been and one of the major

367
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,159
persons who's been doing this work is an

368
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,558
anthropologist at Wisconsin uh schroer

369
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:43,880
and she says in uh in an article from

370
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,319
1999 that 10 to 15 bushels per acre was

371
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,600
typical and that other people that had

372
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,678
been claiming either you know 25 to to

373
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,719
30 bushels per acre or even you know

374
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,240
much above 15 that this was an

375
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,640
exaggeration now hien R and Trigger are

376
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,640
people are two um anthropologists who

377
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,840
have studied the hon who are closely

378
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,280
related um in Ontario and their work

379
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,519
indicated 15 to 25 bushels per acre of

380
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,678
corn was what they thought would be

381
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,720
typical and then bayen was working in

382
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,480
Tennessee and an earlier time um with

383
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,798
Mississippian period Farmers this would

384
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,319
have probably been around

385
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,918
1300 and he surmised um or ES that the

386
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,918
yields would have been in the range of

387
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,200
12 to 25 bues per

388
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,640
acre so what is the rationale for for

389
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,519
these estimates well all three all four

390
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,480
of of these um Scholars have based their

391
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,798
estimates um on yields that us and

392
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,919
Canadian Farmers um would get when they

393
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,679
grow corn continuously on ploud fields

394
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,600
but without adding fertilizers or any

395
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,559
other source of nitrogen and these

396
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,558
modern Farmers when they were questioned

397
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,918
indicated that their corn yields

398
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:09,798
declined um quite steadily after five

399
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,919
years or less of continuous corn without

400
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:15,158
fertilizers um not

401
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,280
surprising you grow corn for five years

402
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,960
on and plow every year on land that's

403
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,558
not been manured or received other you

404
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,400
know nitrogen uh sources yields go down

405
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:28,240
so they surmised from that that native

406
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Farmers would have experienced the same

407
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,079
Yi reductions forcing them to either

408
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,798
open new lands in what people think of

409
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,519
as typical of north of the entire

410
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:44,400
Western Hemisphere shifting cultivation

411
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:48,240
or to accept declining yields and

412
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,600
um so I I would challenge that in

413
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,759
interpretation and I challenge it

414
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:57,038
primarily because they have neglected

415
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,960
the role of organic matter and hillage

416
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:02,359
in soil fertility in pre-industrial

417
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,960
cropping systems plant nutrients and I'm

418
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,639
here I'm talking exclusively about

419
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,000
nitrogen because I think this is the the

420
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,520
key the absolute the controller of of

421
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,440
corn yields there's three ways that

422
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:21,278
farmers can can get it animal waste

423
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,320
legumes or soil organic matter well

424
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,599
native farmers in in the Americas didn't

425
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,399
have animal waste and they didn't have

426
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,439
leggings they didn't have fores um to

427
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,400
rely on either they relied exclusively

428
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,240
on soil organic me and tillage plays a

429
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,440
key role in the ability of soil organic

430
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,960
matter to provide nitrogen so without

431
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,880
considering the role of tillage in soil

432
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,480
organic matter the explanations and the

433
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,400
rationale that these other Scholars have

434
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:58,599
presented um don't really stand up and

435
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,000
here's why we know this is a a graph um

436
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:03,519
radian wild the nature property of soils

437
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,919
um probably um if you've taken the soils

438
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,079
of course you've seen this um this shows

439
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,880
the effects of tillage on soil organic

440
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:17,519
matter and we start out at

441
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:19,559
and on the left hand side if um that

442
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,200
axis is the amount of soil organic

443
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,839
matter in tons per Hector and the

444
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,200
horizontal access is increasing time

445
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,599
going from zero up

446
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,440
to3 years right and the soil organic

447
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,119
matter is divided into these different

448
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,919
components first um plant residues in

449
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,278
the very bright green then the active

450
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,559
organic matter then slow organic matter

451
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,679
and then what they term the passive

452
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:50,399
organic matter pool now almost all of

453
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,798
the nitrogen that is released um upon

454
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,440
decomposition of soil organic matter

455
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:59,599
comes from um everything but the passive

456
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,880
organic matter pool in words this is

457
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,558
pretty it does great things in terms of

458
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,480
structure and other other things for for

459
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,960
soils but in terms of providing nitrogen

460
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,360
almost nothing all of the

461
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,640
nitrogen comes from from these areas

462
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,678
very fast from plant residues and very

463
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,880
fast from the active organic

464
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:25,880
matter more slowly under with the the

465
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,960
slow organic matter what we see is that

466
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,960
with

467
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,720
time these

468
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,960
go down very very quickly and by 10

469
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,400
years we've seen a very steep decline in

470
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,278
the total amount of soil organic matter

471
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,600
and almost all of that loss has been

472
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:44,440
from the portion that provides nitrogen

473
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,798
to

474
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,720
crops notice here we get out to a a

475
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:53,200
place where it it plateaus usually this

476
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,880
would be about 2% soil organic matter

477
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,840
and at this point the soil's ability to

478
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,278
release nitrogen for up take by plants

479
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,000
has almost bottomed out so if we were

480
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,759
looking at yields they would go along

481
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,319
the same place staying pretty high up

482
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,960
here but then all of a sudden beginning

483
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,558
to go down and then they would parallel

484
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
this line right so your yields will will

485
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,798
go down you'll still get something but

486
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,240
your yields will drop quite strongly

487
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:23,400
notice here organic matter organic

488
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,798
matter management improved or the land

489
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,278
is put back into native vegetation and

490
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,240
this active sources begin to rebuild and

491
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:35,480
if you cultivate it again when you were

492
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,798
over here you would get an increase in

493
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,798
crop

494
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:46,678
yields so we know that um when we plow

495
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,839
we initially increase soil fertility if

496
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,559
you go into a land that has not

497
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:54,000
previously been plowed then you will get

498
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:56,720
really nice yields if the soil organic

499
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,919
matter levels are reasonably High that's

500
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,440
because we get the oxidation of the soil

501
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,159
organic matter that oxidation releases

502
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,759
nitrogen in forms that can that plants

503
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,720
can take up since nitrogen is usually

504
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,919
the most limiting nutrient for cereal

505
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,759
grains yields increase um and plowing

506
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,880
fields that have been bowed or pastured

507
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,359
and allowed to accumulate soil organic

508
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,480
matter is a reliable mechanism for

509
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,519
providing nitrogen to crops and it's

510
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,480
used

511
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,558
worldwide the problem happens when we

512
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,640
continue to plow and plow and plow and

513
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:35,038
we get on this downward curve and we

514
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,480
don't add some other source of nitrogen

515
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,640
or we don't rebuild the soil organic

516
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,440
matter less nitrogen gets released every

517
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,278
year um and grain yields inevitably

518
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,558
decline so these soils eventually reach

519
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:53,558
what um about a 2% soil organic matter

520
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:56,038
in which no further loss happens but

521
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,960
then um there very little nitrogen is

522
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,640
released at that plateau and farmers

523
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,480
will typically call these soils worn out

524
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,720
right we know that the single largest

525
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,360
cause of decreased soil organic matter

526
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,360
and agricultural Fields is plowing

527
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,558
tillage all right so let's begin to put

528
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:20,079
all of these pieces together um as I

529
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:24,038
mentioned before the iroy were growing

530
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:26,678
their their maze in this area of Central

531
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:29,119
New York that we know is our most

532
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,000
productive soil

533
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,199
one of the reasons that we we those

534
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,720
soils are productive is that they're

535
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Alphas sols this first map shows all of

536
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,120
the alphas Sals in in the United States

537
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,840
don't pay any attention to to the

538
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,639
different colors those are just moisture

539
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,918
regimes um but notice Alphas Sals right

540
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,759
there in the center of New York State no

541
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,120
surprise that those are our most

542
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,879
agriculturally productive soils our

543
00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:00,079
other large group and even better soils

544
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,840
are mols but those are located more

545
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,639
towards the west and in the you know

546
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,678
center part of of the country but notice

547
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,919
also that the good

548
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,798
soils in the eastern part of the country

549
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,320
there's not much of them right these

550
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,558
alas Sals are here in parts of

551
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,558
Pennsylvania and a little smatterings of

552
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:24,960
them down here but there's not a lot of

553
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:28,319
good agricultural land on the Eastern

554
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,679
Seaboard iroy were very fortunate to to

555
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:34,079
be residing in that area of really nice

556
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,720
soils so they're growing maze on these

557
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,319
highly productive soils so the question

558
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,360
is what would happen if you grew corn

559
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:45,158
continuously on these Alphas Sals but

560
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:48,798
without tillage would we expect to see a

561
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,480
decline in crop yields and I would say

562
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,679
it depends on two things first what is

563
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,440
the initial level of the soil organic

564
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,720
matter and second how much corn are you

565
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,360
taking off what are your yield level

566
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,399
those are the things that would control

567
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,079
it's very hard to find information on

568
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:10,479
unplowed Alphas Sals with they don't

569
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:13,079
exist right but from what I can gather a

570
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,200
4% soil organic matter would be a

571
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,558
conservative estimate of what an

572
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,960
unplowed Alphas Sal would

573
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:23,038
contain that would release somewhere

574
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,038
between 80 to 160 pounds of nitrogen per

575
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,839
acre per year we know that from

576
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,240
precipitation um and decompos of plant

577
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,240
residues you could probably get another

578
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,359
15 to 30 so this gives us a total

579
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,440
available of somewhere between 100 and

580
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:43,519
200 PBS if we look at how much nitrogen

581
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:47,679
we're taking off 75 belel per acre of

582
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:51,759
maze removes somewhere between 75 to 125

583
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,278
pounds of nitrogen per acre now we know

584
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,158
always that we have to have more

585
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,839
nitrogen than what the plant actually

586
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:01,360
takes up right so you know you have to

587
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,720
have more but it's clear that we have

588
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,798
one and a half to two times as much

589
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,079
nitrogen in this system and we could

590
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,119
take off 75 bu per acre of nitrogen

591
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:14,839
every year provided that the soil

592
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:18,079
organic matter level stays at 4% meaning

593
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:21,678
that the land is not

594
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:24,278
cloud and that there is no need for

595
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,679
additional nitrogen inputs in other

596
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:30,720
words that farmers in

597
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:33,640
irana in 1687 when dville came down

598
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,120
could have had great high yields and a

599
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,799
hundred years later perhaps even in that

600
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:43,158
same F Farmers could have still been

601
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:46,798
getting 50 75 perhaps even 100 bushels

602
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:49,679
of corn that is not unreasonable and the

603
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,599
thing that holds it together is the fact

604
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,440
that they're not

605
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:58,240
plowing all right but things change iroy

606
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,038
were dispossessed of their land after

607
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,359
the Revolutionary War and this

608
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:07,720
dispossession sets up an opportunity for

609
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:09,839
us to look at to have our own experiment

610
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,919
of what happens when Farmers come in and

611
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,918
use plazs what happens to corn yields

612
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,559
then particularly if they're using the

613
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,679
same types of open pollinated varieties

614
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:24,319
which they were right so this is what

615
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,240
the the map on the left is what things

616
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:30,960
looked like in 1720 about a 100 years

617
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,798
later iry have been reduced to these

618
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,120
small these small territories

619
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:40,960
reservations and US Farmers have flooded

620
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,879
into the area taking over these areas if

621
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,399
we looked at this map today the the

622
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,720
areas of land that iry people can uh

623
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:54,839
control uh would be probably about U 25%

624
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:59,798
of this even even smaller so we get this

625
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:03,119
sweep into what had been iroy country

626
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:06,278
and now becomes New York State and in

627
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:10,678
1799 there was a

628
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:12,398
uh efforts by land speculators to try to

629
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,840
determine what the agricultural

630
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,119
potential of this area was called and

631
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:21,439
they referred to it as the Gen country

632
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:24,158
and so we get these reports of people

633
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,558
visiting this land um who were looking

634
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,320
to make to first to sell it to Farmers

635
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:32,000
and they wanted to know what the

636
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,759
agricultural potential of it was all

637
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,319
right so this is a there's a whole

638
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,038
series of what are called um letters

639
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,798
from a gentleman to his friend in 1799

640
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,240
and this is a land Speculator and he's

641
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:46,200
telling other speculators kind of what

642
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,200
he thinks the agricultural potential of

643
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,558
this he says the flats of the jese river

644
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,960
and the canisa creek alone cannot be

645
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:58,678
estimated at less than 80 miles in

646
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,960
length um and about two in a body of

647
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:06,120
about 8,000 acres and every acre is I

648
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:08,000
suppose 18 ft deep of black mold perhaps

649
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,000
a bit of an exaggeration but if you've

650
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,119
been out in the genese valley and looked

651
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,919
at some of those soils you know not much

652
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:19,158
it's pretty nice looking soils out there

653
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,880
he said in such land the Indians raise

654
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,480
100 bushels of corn on an acre and they

655
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,960
never have been known to make any change

656
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,798
of the spot in other words they're

657
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,480
continuously dropping and they're

658
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,278
getting 100 bushels of corn per acre now

659
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,960
this guy's trying to sell land right so

660
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,638
there's probably an exaggeration to it

661
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,399
but not a whole

662
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:44,879
lot more quotes the famous J flats are

663
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,759
about 20 20 miles in length and about

664
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,799
four miles wide the soil is remarkably

665
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,879
Rich quite clear of trees and producing

666
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:56,798
grass near 10 fet high in places we

667
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,559
found openings of two and 300 acres free

668
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:03,759
from all Timber bushes which on our

669
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:06,558
examining Pro to be of a rich deep

670
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,359
soil corn generally goes to the amount

671
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,519
of 30 to 40 bushels on an acre and on

672
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,038
Flats of the jness river and of Mud

673
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,839
Creek it is said to the extent of 70 to

674
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:20,079
80 bushs an acre and is very heavy and

675
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:23,278
substantial in quality at this time even

676
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,638
30 to 40 bushels per acre um what

677
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,839
colonial farmers and early you know

678
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:29,839
American farmers in the beginning

679
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,720
typical yields along the Eastern

680
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:36,359
Seaboard on those worn out soils we're

681
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,798
lucky often times to be 25 bushels to

682
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,959
the acre of corn and usually around 10

683
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:46,839
to 15 of wheat so they were coming from

684
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,159
a perspective of soils that great soils

685
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:52,319
get worn out we don't expect great

686
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,679
yields here 30 to 40 bushels on an

687
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:58,918
average place and on some of the better

688
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:01,360
70 to 80 bushel per acre

689
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,000
so this last quote comes from mcnell who

690
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,439
wrote the agricultural history of the

691
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,960
genese valley 1790 to 1860 this was

692
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:14,480
written in in 1952 and and he kind of um

693
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,679
he sums up he provides a a picture of of

694
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,918
what it looked like the information

695
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,918
which they heard of the genese country

696
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,759
made it appear to land Seekers a

697
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:26,519
veritable agricultural Paradise the land

698
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,240
was ready and to the east Farmers

699
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,599
pressed by circumstance

700
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,479
prepared to move into new areas these

701
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,960
were predominantly new englanders who

702
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,838
had been trying to grow crops on

703
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,480
spotools um and had not been having a

704
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:44,039
great deal of luck after the first flush

705
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,878
of soil organic matter had been removed

706
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,639
they were growing wheat things were not

707
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:51,358
looking good they were hungry for new

708
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,800
land the gene country looked like the

709
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:58,358
answer to Farmers um dreams so this is

710
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,240
what happens in 1810 the m there on your

711
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:03,960
left shows dots each dot represents 100

712
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:07,159
people in the genese country right and

713
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,920
you see by 1860 um the population has

714
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,440
just absolutely you know I I don't know

715
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,519
what the the total numbers is but it's

716
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,280
multiplied mult you know many many times

717
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,119
the the population just um

718
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,880
increases dramatically so this is what

719
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,200
the area looks like it includes these

720
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,800
these counties but I'm concentrating

721
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:31,639
mostly on these ER ones because this is

722
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,680
where the more fertile soils are the

723
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,920
alamy ones are down you're getting into

724
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:40,039
the Southern Tier not as great soils um

725
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,920
but the the um the northern half of the

726
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:46,400
genesy country is where these fertile

727
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,079
soils are so after the entry of the US

728
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,960
Farmers with their plow based

729
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,920
agriculture what happened to May yields

730
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,720
well there's very little information

731
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,720
from 1800 to

732
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:01,118
1845 because the early New York censuses

733
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:04,039
don't provide crop yield data they

734
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,119
provide production but you don't know on

735
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:09,838
how on how many acres so it's almost

736
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,920
impossible to get any sense but by

737
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,279
1845 average M yields in the best

738
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,720
agricultural lands of Western New York

739
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,800
were less than 30 bushes an

740
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,000
acre so let's look at what happens from

741
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,640
1845 to to

742
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,440
1940 at genese Livingston Monroe onario

743
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:32,358
and I included Sena although that was

744
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,079
not in the original um genesy country

745
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:37,440
but it is one of our highest producing

746
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,519
agricultural States and certainly place

747
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,559
that the iry were were growing their

748
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:46,679
their crops as well you see that in

749
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,480
1845 um the yields are considerably

750
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:52,480
below 30 bushel per acre and they kind

751
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,559
of stutter along um occasionally growing

752
00:36:52,480 --> 00:37:00,800
up a bit um but it's not until what is

753
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:03,400
that 19 20 that we really get up to um

754
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,599
even approaching 50 bushels per acre

755
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,639
right we begin to see some of these um

756
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,800
these you know counties now granted

757
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:14,639
these are averages these are entire

758
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,920
County averages they include um good

759
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,799
Farmers poor farmers and in between

760
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,960
farmers so there is no doubt that there

761
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,280
were some Farmers that were getting

762
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,639
better yields but the more important

763
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,680
question

764
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:34,559
is what enable this increase from 25 up

765
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,879
to to 50 what was going on that allowed

766
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,719
that to

767
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,400
happen sorry I'm getting ahead of myself

768
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,239
first we have to talk about why did the

769
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,318
yields decline um and what everybody

770
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:48,519
would say is soil depletion and again

771
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:51,838
this is MCN this is the guy writing the

772
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:54,838
history of the Agricultural history of

773
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,759
the um genesy valy he says new

774
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:59,759
englanders remember those are the folks

775
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,079
that were flooding in here predominantly

776
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,800
knew little of the methods or importance

777
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,400
of rotating crops a three crop system

778
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,519
rain grass and bow did little to

779
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,880
maintain soil fertility soil amarant

780
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,880
were conspicuously neglected animal

781
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,519
manures were not systematically and

782
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,400
carefully used artificial fertilizers

783
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,000
were not

784
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,720
employed says Farmers whether tilling

785
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,800
the rich soils of the genese or

786
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,519
elsewhere were guilty of defective

787
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,640
cropping practices the fertility of

788
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:33,318
their lands was sapped by repeated

789
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:37,078
croppings by poor rotation schemes or

790
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:40,519
none and by the neglect of

791
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,800
fertilizers so how did the yields

792
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:46,079
increase how did farmers get around this

793
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,280
problem well it's the introduction of

794
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,880
Forge legumes that saves them same thing

795
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,440
happened in Europe with European wheat

796
00:38:51,880 --> 00:39:01,000
Farmers it was not until they discovered

797
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:05,280
Clover that plow agriculture becomes um

798
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,920
a sustainable practice in the in the US

799
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:12,280
it's predominantly Clover and later

800
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,079
alala um this is combined with the more

801
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,319
careful use of animal manure and this

802
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:21,119
ameliorates the effects of intensive

803
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,719
clowing forage Lums have very different

804
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,440
characteristics than do grain LS so it's

805
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:29,759
not good enough to just add a beam um

806
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,519
picture of of P here right and over

807
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,680
there is alal right look at the

808
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,318
difference in those two CRS the P's are

809
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,919
an annual and the amount of organic

810
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:41,679
matter biomass and nitrogen that they

811
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,079
contribute to the following crop is

812
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:48,519
minimal first because we eat the p and

813
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,560
most of the nitrogen goes with it right

814
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:55,280
and unless we're returning night soil to

815
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:58,358
the to the land that nitrogen is is lost

816
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,240
second there's hardly any biom

817
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:04,400
third that crop dies as soon as it's cut

818
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:07,078
so once you go through and harvest the

819
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,680
the peas and you cut that plant it's

820
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,079
grow it's its growing period is over now

821
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,000
compare that with a crop like red clover

822
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,640
or alala number one you're not removing

823
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,880
the grain it's staying there at most you

824
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:24,039
may be feeding it to an analy and

825
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,680
returning the waste back to the land but

826
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:30,480
more importantly it's a pry and you cut

827
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,838
it it's like it says whoopee I can grow

828
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,960
again and it's got a a root system that

829
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:38,400
allows it to grow up again and you can

830
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,679
you can produce enormous amounts of

831
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:46,079
nitrogen Rich biomass that either get

832
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:49,519
plowed back in um or that you feed to an

833
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,440
an animal and return the animal waste

834
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,440
back the other thing that happens with

835
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,119
forage legumes is that you're not

836
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,079
plowing anyway um because they they have

837
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,599
to be their you know perennials it takes

838
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,920
longer to get them seated Farmers keep

839
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,760
them in for two to four years and so

840
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,680
you're not plowing those fields annually

841
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,319
um so there's an opportunity um to

842
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:15,559
greatly increase soil organic matter

843
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:18,000
because these crops remain in place um

844
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:21,078
they reduce the amount of of plowing and

845
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,838
they amarate or they um repair the

846
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,560
damage um that's been caused by plowing

847
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:31,000
and at the same time they Supply

848
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:33,559
nitrogen succeeding grain crops and to

849
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,318
animals that you you feed that Forge to

850
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:40,358
so red clover is

851
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:42,239
like the Magic Bullet for farmers in

852
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:46,358
Western New York and it was primarily

853
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:48,679
red clover and um Timothy some farmers

854
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:53,279
were using this in the 18th century but

855
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:56,519
it was not common um by 1839 New York

856
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,280
led the nation in the production of hay

857
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:01,679
and VI another agricultural historian

858
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,400
says that in the wheat growing region of

859
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,879
the western part of the state and he's

860
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,800
talking about New York it had been found

861
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,599
that the growing of clover and the

862
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,880
grazing of cattle and sheep on the

863
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,079
depleted wheat lands would greatly

864
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,358
increase their yields and of course the

865
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:20,000
reason that that's happening is because

866
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:22,838
it's restoring soil organic matter so it

867
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,480
takes forged legumes along with a tight

868
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,599
integration of of animals and crops to

869
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,679
make cloud-based agricultural system in

870
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,079
Western New York both productive and

871
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,919
sustainable so here are the conclusions

872
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,760
that that I would draw from this first

873
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,760
that iro maze was highly productive and

874
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,680
sustainable because first they were

875
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,880
farming on these very fertile Alphas

876
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:47,358
Sals with high levels of soil organic

877
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,760
matter the absence of plows far from

878
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:53,838
being uh a disadvantage uh was the

879
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,559
reason that they were able to maintain

880
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,039
uh their soil organic matter because

881
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:01,280
they weren't oxidizing um with intensive

882
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,920
cultivation New York Farmers on the

883
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,240
other hand um didn't have a chance of

884
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,880
maintaining those yields they likely got

885
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:12,719
them early in the first um 1800 to 1840

886
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,000
likely yields at least in the early

887
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,159
1800s were quite reasonable when they

888
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,960
moved on to those Alpha sols but

889
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:23,239
certainly by 1845 the indication was

890
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,800
that the yields were their M shields

891
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,000
were were not good at all and that was

892
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,280
um caused by the reduction of soil

893
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
organic matter that was a result of

894
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,720
continual tillage um the lack of

895
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,838
appropriate management practices

896
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:40,639
including forages um manure and

897
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,759
rotations was also a part of this and of

898
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,440
course um solving that problem required

899
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,319
the introduction of forage LS so I'll

900
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,318
end there and happy to take any

901
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,318
questions

902
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:58,839
[Applause]

903
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:05,598
yes Chris so how did the arqua or the

904
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:08,199
native peoples maintain their soil

905
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,318
organic matter I mean they must have

906
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,159
done something to get the corn into the

907
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:16,239
ground yes and they must also have taken

908
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:19,239
off that yield because that's what the

909
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:22,279
what the generals told us they got lot a

910
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:24,598
lot of maze off there so why is the soil

911
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,119
organic matter not being oxidized

912
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,760
because the most loss of soil organic

913
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,079
comes from tillage not from crop removal

914
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,680
so as long as the soil organic matter

915
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,240
stays at 4% which there's no reason to

916
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,519
think that it won't right um if you're

917
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:42,719
not plowing up a whole field there's no

918
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:45,519
reason to think that it won't stay at 4%

919
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:49,159
and in fact you're adding crop residues

920
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,559
back to that mound weeds cornstalks are

921
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,239
all going back in there's no reason to

922
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,800
think that soil organic matter levels

923
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:59,118
are going to decline the major loss of

924
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,760
soil organic at these yield levels comes

925
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,838
from plowing tillage not soil removal

926
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,400
right so as long as soil organic matter

927
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:11,880
levels stay at 4% the soil can continue

928
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,960
to release right so it's not the crop

929
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,200
that's taking out all that nitrogen it's

930
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:21,000
the plowing right if you look at how

931
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:23,159
much nitrogen is in a 75 Buel um acre

932
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,480
yield of of corn it's somewhere between

933
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:29,960
75 and maybe 125 pounds per acre of nit

934
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,039
you've got more than enough in the soil

935
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,599
organic matter to do that I understand

936
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,880
that some of it is getting oxidized but

937
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:40,200
you're only doing a small amount and

938
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:44,358
you're replacing lots of crop residues

939
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:47,000
back in that mound so my my argument is

940
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:50,039
that the soil organic matter could be

941
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,480
stable and that's what accounts for the

942
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:55,800
you know sustainability of the so how

943
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,960
come they didn't spend all their time

944
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,760
weaving because they didn't have the

945
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,480
same weeds almost all of our nasty weeds

946
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,000
came from Europe so you look at the at

947
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,599
the worst weeds no it's the Dr you look

948
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,679
at the worst weeds in the European

949
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,559
Imports and they weren't plowing why do

950
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:15,558
you think we have so many wheat problems

951
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,040
because we plow and we create ideal

952
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,920
conditions for weeds to germinate right

953
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:22,318
so without plowing they weren't doing

954
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,720
that they were not spreading weeds

955
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,440
through animal manure which is the way

956
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:30,838
most of the weeds got spread from Europe

957
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,639
right came um either with other stuff

958
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,838
eaten by animals spread hither and yond

959
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,358
through animal waste right none of those

960
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,880
things were happening right so they were

961
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:40,880
pretty damn

962
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,759
lucky so if you take 80 to 100 pounds

963
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,239
per acre of nitrogen off of each crop as

964
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,520
you just indicated how much what is the

965
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:55,399
pool of nitrogen that's in that until um

966
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:58,559
soil in ter with the same how many

967
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:02,039
hundred pounds well basically if you if

968
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,559
you if you believe uh um you know Brady

969
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:08,318
and and wild they say I think that you

970
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:12,200
for every percent of soil organic matter

971
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:15,960
you can get 20 to 40 pounds oxidized per

972
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:19,039
year released per year okay so if you've

973
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,838
got 4% soil organic matter you've got

974
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,960
somewhere between 80 and 160

975
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,759
pounds well that's not even as much as

976
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,838
you took off the crop no you only took

977
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,839
off 75 to

978
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,359
right and you have additional coming

979
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:38,799
from precipitation and decomposition

980
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,519
right so you can plan on another 15 to

981
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,039
30 annual contribution from

982
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,358
precipitation and decomposition of plant

983
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:47,558
residues that's crop residues if you

984
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:50,519
don't till them under you're going to

985
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:53,359
lose most of the nitrogen no no not true

986
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:56,838
at all they plant residues do not

987
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:59,159
volatilize right the decomposition will

988
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:02,279
will take place whether it's whether

989
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,519
it's it's covered with with soil or or

990
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,640
not that is not going to it's not going

991
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:06,639
to

992
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,680
Evol so I mean the the real question is

993
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,519
is the soil organic matter levels did

994
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:24,078
they remain stable um there is no

995
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,400
indication um that iroy were practicing

996
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,079
shifting

997
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,000
cultivation no indication at all they

998
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,160
were in the same Fields continuously

999
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,559
right um there were lots of indications

1000
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:38,078
that they were burning right um and they

1001
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,119
did sometimes change Fields but they

1002
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,480
were not rotating

1003
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:46,559
Fields cutting burning resting and

1004
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,440
returning to the same field um and I

1005
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,960
mean you could argue that they had

1006
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,440
plenty of soil they had no need to

1007
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,599
return to the same field so there could

1008
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,280
be an argument that yes they were

1009
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,640
cutting and burning they were going to

1010
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,440
New Field

1011
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:02,879
but the indication is no there's very

1012
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,720
little evidence in the historical

1013
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,280
documents that they were routinely

1014
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:11,159
opening new Fields particularly because

1015
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,000
of soil depletion no indication of that

1016
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:16,078
at all lots of indication of that in New

1017
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,760
England along the Eastern Seaboard

1018
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,519
Virginia North South Carolina Georgia

1019
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,760
lots of indication that that's what

1020
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:24,679
Farmers there were doing because they

1021
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,520
were really having problems because they

1022
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:30,239
had these ultisols or SP

1023
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:33,480
um or incepto sols that had much lower

1024
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,479
amounts of of soil

1025
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:39,118
organic uh we've got some questions up

1026
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:42,199
in Geneva sorry forgot you were there

1027
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,200
yes far

1028
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,160
away J I was wondering in the last

1029
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,720
couple of decades we've seen quite a bit

1030
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:53,199
of attention to reduce tillage in this

1031
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,159
very same region and I was wondering if

1032
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,719
you have any observations on how that is

1033
00:49:55,159 --> 00:50:00,719
being done and if it's being done in way

1034
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,598
uh that increases the odds of recovering

1035
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,239
the

1036
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,838
productivity I mean I I think that any

1037
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:10,519
attempts to decrease tillage are going

1038
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:14,679
to be helpful for long-term you know um

1039
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:16,759
productivity of of of soils um I but I

1040
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,598
think it it also means that you have to

1041
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,720
look at how do you get that organic

1042
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,280
matter back in not just that you stop

1043
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,959
tilling but that you begin to um use

1044
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,680
other practices whether they're cover

1045
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,798
crops or um animal manure um things that

1046
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:35,358
will increase soil organic met I know

1047
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:40,679
when I've spoken with

1048
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:43,239
um uh quirine Karin uh about corn yields

1049
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,199
she says that she can predict a corn

1050
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,558
yield based on the soil organic matter

1051
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,118
content um almost depending on where it

1052
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:52,400
comes from right but that any time that

1053
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,400
they have soil organic matter levels

1054
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,559
that are between 3 and 4% it's very hard

1055
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,880
for them to get a high high yield

1056
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,160
regardless of how much um you know

1057
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,119
inorganic fertilizers they add so

1058
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,759
certainly soil organic matter I think is

1059
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:11,358
being increasingly recognized as the key

1060
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,520
to productivity and um in general it's

1061
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,960
hard to increase soil organic matter

1062
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:19,559
just by adding nitrogen you have to have

1063
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:24,519
other practices in place um that that

1064
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,519
you know allow for that to to

1065
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:31,318
happen Jane do we have any information

1066
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:34,358
on rainfall or rainfall patterns over

1067
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:37,558
that that period of time that could have

1068
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:39,039
been besides the organic soil organic

1069
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:42,280
matter that there could be some of

1070
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:45,719
offsetting that made plant growth more

1071
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,400
more luxurious during that era no and

1072
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,639
there's even some indications that there

1073
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,760
were several periods in which

1074
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:54,039
temperatures were quite a bit cooler

1075
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,599
which would actually um cause quite a

1076
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,558
bit of difficulty with corn growth and

1077
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:02,280
indiction that in some years things did

1078
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:05,440
not go well so um that yield you know

1079
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:09,079
declined be because

1080
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,280
of you know climate weather and uh about

1081
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:16,440
precipitation I I don't have any

1082
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,359
information in at all um but I can't I

1083
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,480
mean most of the time in New York um we

1084
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:24,838
don't suffer terribly from precipitation

1085
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,280
you know deficit uh we do get the you

1086
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:29,558
know occasional drought um but um I

1087
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,160
would suspect that they would be

1088
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,559
relatively similar with the ups and

1089
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:37,920
downs that we still

1090
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:41,680
see Chris what would happen uh if you

1091
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,480
superimpose instead of continuous corn

1092
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:48,399
the three sister program on these soils

1093
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:51,480
would it decrease the pressure on solid

1094
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,000
organic matter and nitrogen or would it

1095
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,639
I mean a lot of the results I showed you

1096
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,358
actually were um some were from

1097
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,679
monoculture and some of those corals

1098
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,719
were from three sisters were from you

1099
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:04,480
know polycultures what we found was that

1100
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,558
there was no difference in cornal

1101
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,798
whether they were grown as monocultures

1102
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:13,079
or as three sisters so my observation is

1103
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:15,519
that um in terms of nitrogen the beans

1104
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,000
would provide almost nothing because

1105
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,838
they're being eaten there is some in the

1106
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,199
stems and and leaves uh over a long term

1107
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:25,519
you're kind of adding to to the pool

1108
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:27,199
that you know soil soil nitrogen pool is

1109
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,559
is getting added to

1110
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:36,159
um but in the the short term um not not

1111
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:38,839
much um the quantity it's hard to you

1112
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,879
know make any estimates what we found

1113
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:43,119
was that um although corn yields were

1114
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,079
not affected by whether they were grown

1115
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,680
as as monocultures or polycultures that

1116
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,440
beans and pumpkin were greatly affected

1117
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:54,879
in other words you took a tremendous um

1118
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,358
drop in yields um if you were if you

1119
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,920
compared be culture to being grown as

1120
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:03,920
part of the three sisters there's also

1121
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,639
evidence that the iroy grew Beans by

1122
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,838
themselves and grew pumpkins by

1123
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:10,879
themselves they didn't always grow them

1124
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,400
mixed in mixed in so they were clearly

1125
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,400
you know kind of deciding whether they

1126
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,079
needed to add to their stores of beans

1127
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,480
they probably didn't plant them with

1128
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,599
corn if they were looking maybe to trade

1129
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,760
or or something like that they probably

1130
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:26,599
put in in you know monocultures of of

1131
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
those um and how much that might have

1132
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:31,960
impacted I mean there's not a lot of

1133
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:35,559
crop residue from from Beans and not a

1134
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,559
whole lot from pumpkin either or squash

1135
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,559
um you can get fairly substantial

1136
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,519
amounts of crop residue from corn

1137
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:44,480
particularly good crop um so I would

1138
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:48,280
think that the major effect comes from

1139
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:52,280
corn and not from Beans

1140
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:54,599
P yes I've seen pictures especially from

1141
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,559
elementary school days of black and

1142
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,720
white line drawings of presumably

1143
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:02,519
Coastal Native Americans showing

1144
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:05,639
settlers how to fertilize their corn by

1145
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:09,440
planting a fish now is that revisionist

1146
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:11,159
history completely bogus or uh what

1147
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,119
what's that all it seems to be some

1148
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,039
combination there's been a huge argument

1149
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,559
going on for about 50 years about how

1150
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:20,440
true that is um my sense is that it may

1151
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,119
have been true for Coastal Indians they

1152
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,838
were growing on spotools and on really

1153
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,480
poor um nutrient status um you know

1154
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:30,480
soils and it would have made sense for

1155
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,760
them to do that uh they were also

1156
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,519
growing much smaller areas uh there's no

1157
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,839
indication of 100 200 acre fields of

1158
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:43,079
corn out in New England right um at the

1159
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,679
time of contact whereas iroy are growing

1160
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,400
on some of the finest soils we have in

1161
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:49,318
the country I mean they're they're not

1162
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,960
mols but they're pretty pretty darn good

1163
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,880
and they're growing these huge acreages

1164
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,240
so I mean how in the world do you gather

1165
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,280
up all these uh fish and throw them to

1166
00:55:55,239 --> 00:56:02,159
each map it's uh it kind of it it

1167
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:03,760
doesn't seem realistic so and it doesn't

1168
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,960
match with kind of what we know about

1169
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,200
those soils it's a lot of work to do for

1170
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,760
no response right you throw the fish in

1171
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:13,279
and nothing happens you still get the

1172
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,280
same great yield right

1173
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,559
so yes I'm just wondering how good of an

1174
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,119
estimate of the total area in

1175
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:21,760
cultivation at this time was and how

1176
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:23,440
good estimates do we have of the total

1177
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,720
population to get

1178
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,400
some excellent questions likely to be

1179
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,639
quite small because the total population

1180
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,599
was probably quite small populations

1181
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:37,879
were going up and down um because of

1182
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:41,559
disease because of warfare um so the

1183
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:44,318
iroy populations were probably um never

1184
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:47,720
much higher than 40 to 50,000 people and

1185
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:50,119
so when we looked at um at what the

1186
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:52,798
areas that uh I mean if you look at

1187
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:54,920
Village sites and look at the areas of

1188
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,280
good land you know around those Village

1189
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:02,000
sites if you go out to gen

1190
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:05,160
um in that area if you look up at um

1191
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,280
gandan um and you look at the highest

1192
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,798
yielding soils it's way more than what

1193
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,720
they could possibly have utilized right

1194
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:17,159
so they did not have the types of land

1195
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:20,558
pressure that were you know you know

1196
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:24,318
evident in in other areas right so that

1197
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,680
so they were not using nearly the the

1198
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,599
land that they had to the Capac

1199
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:32,358
that it could have you know could have

1200
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,119
been done so certainly a small

1201
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:39,038
population on good soils and not being

1202
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:41,838
pushed to use the resource to its full

1203
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:43,520
extent yes sort of related to that how

1204
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,880
large was the community that might be

1205
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:48,480
associated with 100 acres of corn

1206
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,000
anywhere is from a couple of hundred to

1207
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,039
a couple thousand and we don't know if

1208
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,239
that 200 acres of corn was the only

1209
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,960
field that was had um by a you know

1210
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:01,759
particular Community or if they had a

1211
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:04,358
couple um but generally iroan Villages

1212
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:08,000
tended to be a couple of hundred up to

1213
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:12,719
as many as 2,000 um so up

1214
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:16,079
in um Gene Gennesse Geneva there's a

1215
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:19,679
senut community about 1720 that may have

1216
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,318
been around 1500 people

1217
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,719
um

1218
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:27,558
so not huge you know areas but then

1219
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,000
again you know not insignificant or not

1220
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:30,798
huge

1221
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,880
populations there's a whole lot more

1222
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:35,519
work that could be done matching kind of

1223
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,680
soils and and populations we're

1224
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,038
beginning to get some good estimates on

1225
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:43,679
actual population numbers there's a

1226
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:45,880
number of of EO studies Scholars who are

1227
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:48,440
working very diligently on that actually

1228
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,358
two of them right here at at Cornell so

1229
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,240
very interested in population numbers

1230
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:56,318
and how they're going up and down I just

1231
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:58,519
have to persuade them that it's umth at

1232
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:02,358
the soils and the agricultural potential

1233
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:02,358
too so they're mildly

1234
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,239
interested okay well thank do we have

1235
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,159
any more question this has been a

1236
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:14,000
production of Cornell University on the

1237
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,000
web at cornell.edu
