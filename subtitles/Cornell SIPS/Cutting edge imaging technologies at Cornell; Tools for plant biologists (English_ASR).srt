1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,519
University I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,600
um Cutting Edge Technologies in the

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,439
Imaging facility uh so as you can see um

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,400
all the labels that are new are

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:24,839
instruments that have just arrived this

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:27,959
year or are um we're planning to get in

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,240
the uh near future so this is sort of a

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,759
Services overview we have stand

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,439
microscopes and fluorescent tools so

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,840
fluorimeters

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,000
spectrometers um missing we have uh

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Advanced microscopies what we call

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
Advanced microscopies so comp focal

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,079
multif Photon we're expecting a super

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,960
resolution system in January we have a

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:55,000
laser capture micro dissection system uh

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,000
a fax a CT and a bunch of technologies

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,640
that we call inital Imaging and then

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,799
support for image analysis and

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,560
visualization and so how we normally

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,640
work um

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,478
is uh you know you make an appointment

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,680
we sit down we talk about what you want

25
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,799
to do and we try and put you on the tool

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,320
that will work out best for you if you

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,960
know what tool you want to use um we'll

28
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:23,599
get you trained in on it and um we

29
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:27,280
generally charge by the hour um but uh

30
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,719
the facts and the CT are full service so

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,239
you drop off your specimens and we image

32
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,359
them for

33
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:39,839
you um and of course um our staff is our

34
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,359
most important resource Mark richio runs

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,079
the CT he's going to be uh tag teaming

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:51,718
with me Carol Bales um right here runs

37
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,758
microscopy and fact Joanna delar Cruz

38
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:58,280
microscopy in the inital Imaging and

39
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,599
Teresa pory does CT super resolution and

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,000
some uh 3D printing

41
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,000
and I'm tangled on the system

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,959
here

43
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:14,360
um use that Arrow so our com focal

44
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,640
microscopes um serve probably the the

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,480
biggest number of users as you probably

46
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,439
know uh com focal microscopy was

47
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,799
developed for Imaging into thicker or

48
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,840
cloudy specimens um oh I do have no

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,640
that's not a pointer um it it enables

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,200
you to get a nice clear detailed section

51
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:37,079
into what would appear you know

52
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,199
optically blurry on a normal microscope

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,800
um

54
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:48,318
but so that's really um it's more kind

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,840
of a One-Stop shop now um people these

56
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,439
our comforable microscopes are

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,200
incredibly well engineered and intuitive

58
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,598
and people use them for thin samples and

59
00:02:54,199 --> 00:03:01,839
thick samples basically you can choose

60
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:05,199
whatever exitation line you need um your

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,799
emission color um the bandwidth of your

62
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,359
emission color and depending on what

63
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,799
system you can use you can have up to 34

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,480
different colors they have automated

65
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,239
stages so if you want to image something

66
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,119
with a field of view that is larger than

67
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,200
what your objective provides it will

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,640
automatically tile for you or you can um

69
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,000
look at different positions and follow

70
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,559
them over time they have automated f

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,120
Focus um and of course they have

72
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,400
everything to keep your cells Happy on

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,719
the stage um temperature modulation or

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,640
gas modulation um if you need that and

75
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,878
this is our spinning disc system this is

76
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,399
for if you need speed um on the order of

77
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:54,158
100 images per second it also has a fast

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,319
Focus motor if you need that um and this

79
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,840
system is also good if you're having

80
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:03,158
phototoxicity issues so this system is

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,319
supposed to be gentler on your

82
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:08,359
specimens um and now so multiphoton

83
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,639
microscopy was developed here a couple

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:17,840
of decades ago in the web lab um here at

85
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:21,759
Cornell um there's always been lots of

86
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:26,119
user-built multiphoton systems around uh

87
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,639
not entirely user friendly um now we

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,079
actually as of last month we have a

89
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,960
lovely nicely engineered multiphoton

90
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,159
system that's easy to use so all you

91
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:39,239
have to do is type in the wavelength and

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,560
press go so it's actually easier to use

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,800
than some of the um standard linear

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,680
lasers so what multiphoton gives you is

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,160
deeper Imaging it's good for you know

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,400
thicker pieces of tissue or you know

97
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,680
live plants live mice that sort of thing

98
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,839
it gives you access to Second harmonic

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,199
generation and other nonlinear signals

100
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,879
I'm not going to talk about that um also

101
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,759
probably most importantly it gives you

102
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,079
axially restricted photo damage and

103
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,960
photo AC activation and I'll talk a

104
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,599
little bit about that so multiphoton

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,399
microscopy was really heavily um adopted

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,560
into the Neuroscience Community this is

107
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,758
an example Imaging probably the world

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,519
record um Imaging a millimeter down into

109
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,520
the vasculature um of mice now um

110
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,560
especially young brain is pretty

111
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,879
transparent probably this is kind of a

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,079
special thing most people get around 500

113
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:40,519
or 600 microns in but this is an example

114
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:45,159
of um some image images that have just

115
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:47,680
been taken recently on our new LSM 780

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,919
multif Photon system this is a cleared

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,280
pop Leaf um and I can't see it very well

118
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:57,839
from over here but you can essentially

119
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,239
um image all the way through the leaf um

120
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,000
into the you know from

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,918
um I'm going to get I don't know Leaf

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,959
terminology the Palisades into the mesop

123
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,758
here but you essentially get all the way

124
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:14,120
through and this was taken by Monica

125
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,199
carvalo from Carl Nicholas's lab um and

126
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,759
they're interested in the vein lits here

127
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,639
so this is a single image you know taken

128
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
out of this stack right here and you can

129
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,120
see that you can um image pretty well

130
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,919
all the way through the leaf um the

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,079
clear Leaf if you need to do that um so

132
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,000
multiphoton also gives you 3D resolve

133
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,959
photo

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,120
bleaching um photo destruction and photo

135
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:45,079
Activation so I want to talk a little

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,879
bit about this so this um if I um focus

137
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,758
a standard laser beam through a

138
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,879
fluorescent sample right here you see

139
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,280
that you get pretty much just as much

140
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,360
photo activation all along the line um

141
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,638
kocal what it does is basically just

142
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,680
image this part it throws out this part

143
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,519
and this part by using using a detector

144
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,840
aperture that is optically conjugate or

145
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:10,198
com focal how multiphoton works is it

146
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:13,159
actually just activates at the focal

147
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,720
volume right here so this is a zoom up

148
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,840
of this of this region and this enables

149
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,759
you to do things that are a little more

150
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,359
quantitative for example if you want to

151
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,120
know about the mobility in your sample

152
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,960
you may want to do some a standard photo

153
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,399
bleaching analysis so in in three

154
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,399
dimensions it turns out that that's very

155
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,638
difficult with normal um linear

156
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,318
excitation because um so you would go

157
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,918
along right here you would you would

158
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,240
park your laser beam and you get

159
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,799
fluoresence you you have a bleaching

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,439
pulse right here which bleaches down and

161
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,879
this recovery is due to unbleached

162
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,560
molecules that diffuse back into your

163
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,560
focal volume so this is dependent both

164
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,759
on your diffusion coefficient and your

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,598
focal volume single Photon it's a very

166
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,038
not very well defined focal volume two

167
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,959
Photon it's very well defined you can

168
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,918
get good numbers out of this single

169
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:16,198
Photon you can't get good numbers in

170
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,598
three dimensions so this is also um um

171
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,400
applicable

172
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,839
to uh

173
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,839
photoactivated um

174
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,719
gfp um molecules such as meos so in this

175
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,279
case you excite with purple light and

176
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,479
you turn the green molecule to red and

177
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,319
you can watch this um diffuse away and

178
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,240
you can quantitatively um determine what

179
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,879
the diffusion coefficient is so for

180
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,480
Mobility um you also for instance

181
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,559
targeted oblation if you want to do that

182
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,360
this is um an example from the laming

183
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,039
lab from Philip Eiserman uh what they

184
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,839
would like to do is Sever the actin

185
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,679
filaments um within a cell without

186
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,959
affecting the nucleus so right here

187
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,838
they're going to this is using normal

188
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,000
compal microscopy the image and they're

189
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,000
going to use

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,799
multiphoton to sever the actin filaments

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,440
which are above the nucleus in this case

192
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:17,078
um so you can see that they do that

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,800
without um damaging the nucleus and this

194
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:22,519
is the second place winner in our image

195
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,439
contest this year so get your images

196
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,159
ready for

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,079
spring

198
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,199
um so

199
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,799
um and I just wanted to harp on this for

200
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,040
a little bit um this this area right now

201
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:41,799
of optogenetics is really hot right now

202
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,759
um um being able to op optically

203
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,958
activate signaling molecules and you all

204
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,399
probably know more about these um

205
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:53,518
phytochrome B um and um as a light

206
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,839
sensing protein because it came from

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,440
plants and so the idea here

208
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:03,519
um is that if you um activate

209
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:08,000
phytochrome B at 650

210
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,320
nanm um it will bind this phytochrome

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,600
interaction factor or the blue triangle

212
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,278
right here and people have now um

213
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,519
engineered this into Maman systems um

214
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:23,480
where if you opt optically activate this

215
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,679
protein um it will bring an a a a a row

216
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,000
affector molecule to the membrane

217
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,199
surface and basically activate it and

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,078
this is an example of

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,200
that microscope PowerPoint has stopped

220
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,078
working very

221
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,278
interesting

222
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:49,199
um okay we'll see it might be that um

223
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,200
movie um we'll try it again

224
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,600
in okay doesn't like that movie but so

225
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,519
what you would have seen if you saw that

226
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:06,560
movie in that movie was just taken from

227
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:10,120
um from the nature paper but basically

228
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:14,599
you can see that if you opt optically

229
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,600
activate let me go back here

230
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Escape

231
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:28,799
um so if you optically activate um this

232
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,559
um cell what you see is that pseudopod

233
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,359
extension in that direction and and

234
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,319
basically I just wanted to make the

235
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,240
point that the molecular biology is

236
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,040
really hard but the optical activation

237
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,159
is super easy um if you want to you know

238
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,078
we have um a microscope stage that will

239
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,799
keep your cells nice and happy if you

240
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,159
want to do any kind of optical

241
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:56,559
activation anywhere um for any amount of

242
00:11:53,159 --> 00:12:01,000
time uh it's very easy to do and it's

243
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:05,000
very um um in intuitive how to do it on

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,440
these systems um and similar to that

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,120
this is the the laser capture micro

246
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,680
dissection system talking about moving

247
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:18,078
laser beams around um so basically the

248
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,638
idea here is um this is mostly made for

249
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:24,000
hystological type sections that you

250
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,120
place them um on in general mostly you

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,078
place them on these specialized slides

252
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,679
that have a little thin piece of plastic

253
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,879
on them and you identify regions of

254
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:38,879
Interest so in this case the breast

255
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:41,958
epithelial cells um and um you rest

256
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,480
press go and it will basically cut out

257
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:48,198
the region that you're interested in and

258
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,759
puff it into the endorf tube um for

259
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:55,278
further analysis so this is example from

260
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:59,799
js's Lab um his students are interested

261
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:02,480
in epithelial tissue um they cut those

262
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:05,958
regions this is actually Imaging the cap

263
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,759
right here of the endorf tube um you see

264
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,559
that they've picked out those regions

265
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,240
you close up the cap and you send it off

266
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,599
to

267
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,360
genomics um so this can be done at the

268
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,399
Single Cell level and even the single

269
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:24,240
nuclei level if you're patient enough um

270
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,120
so that being said all the all the

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,198
technologies that I talked about so far

272
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,399
are are limited by the fraction

273
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:35,319
essentially and the idea here um is if

274
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,720
you have an infinitely small point and

275
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,879
you image it you're going to get a point

276
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,879
spread function um and I had to get this

277
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,360
into a talk Lambda over 2 and a so

278
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:49,120
Lambda the wavelength that you're

279
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,800
working with two Divi divided by 2 and a

280
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,399
the numerical aperture of your objective

281
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,278
this is going to be the size of your

282
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,559
point spread function if you have a

283
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,519
couple of spots within that they will

284
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:04,159
not be able to be resolved

285
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,039
and just because it's a soap box of mine

286
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,399
um this is actually point spread

287
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:12,879
functions um in um

288
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,720
cross-section and you can see so Lambda

289
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,799
over 2 and a the width of the point

290
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
spread functions is here but it's

291
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,319
actually the length of the point sprad

292
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,199
functions that's really dependent on na

293
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,959
and that's really what changes as you go

294
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:29,559
to lower na so super resolution

295
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,399
microscopes are microscopes that break

296
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:38,319
the defraction limit um and this is an

297
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:42,240
example of um a lovely example of uh

298
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,759
chromosomes um from po coen's laboratory

299
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,159
and you can see with normal microscopy

300
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,879
you can't resolve the strands um and

301
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,240
this sort of thing whereas with super

302
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,039
resolution microscopy you can and this

303
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
sort of thing is really important to her

304
00:14:54,039 --> 00:15:00,439
because she studies uh chromosome

305
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:04,359
crossover so where they cross over is uh

306
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:08,040
critical so uh super resolution

307
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,399
microscopy is actually a bunch of

308
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,159
microscopies with a bunch of very

309
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,240
different

310
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:18,879
Technologies um so and you know this

311
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,959
year's Nobel Prize to chemistry went to

312
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,600
bsig hell and mner for a lot of these um

313
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,479
Technologies bets and mner were Cornell

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,600
grads you probably a lot of you know

315
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,399
them maybe um

316
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,519
so the system that we're getting in

317
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,278
January um you uh can accommodate the

318
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,519
first two the localization based and um

319
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:46,159
the super resolution Sim structured

320
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,959
illumination um multiple objectives is

321
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,559
another way trying to put as many

322
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,518
objectives as you can close to the

323
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,039
sample that helps you instead I'm not

324
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,879
going to talk about correlative eem um

325
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:00,439
ay scan is another technology that we're

326
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:03,078
going to be getting uh in the spring

327
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,240
so localization based super resolution

328
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:10,758
microscopy is actually um so this is

329
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,318
goes by storm Palm um GSD um is actually

330
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,079
pretty

331
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:17,078
simple um so if you imagine that these

332
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:18,758
are molecules that you would like to be

333
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,439
able to resolve these little yellow

334
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,720
things if they're within the point

335
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,720
spread function which is indicated by

336
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,480
the red blur here you will not be able

337
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,839
to resolve them normally however

338
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,000
if you can get them to Blink so this

339
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,319
comes on and then off and you basically

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,839
look for the center of the point spread

341
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:42,240
function you can identify it this blinks

342
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,959
on you look for the center this blinks

343
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,959
on and off and you look for the center

344
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:52,278
now you have resolved your Flor fores to

345
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:57,919
greater than um the defraction limit and

346
00:16:52,278 --> 00:17:00,799
this is an example of um of Alexa 647

347
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,879
labeled tubulin in a storm

348
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:06,359
buffer and this probably not going to

349
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,000
play but you know it's

350
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,759
actually um not very interesting they

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,959
just

352
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,000
blink

353
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:19,439
and so and this

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,359
is so this is the um the results a

355
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,839
standard image of microtubules would

356
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,958
look like this a a storm image then

357
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,038
looks like this so now you've resolved

358
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,080
the microtubules this is taken by

359
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,879
members of the um zipfel group this is

360
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:38,359
an example an onion bulb using this

361
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,200
technology psf stained

362
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:46,159
cellulose um so the the

363
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,319
blinking um super resolution

364
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,919
microscopies okay so these typically

365
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:54,240
result in 20 nanometer resolution 10

366
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,080
times better than the defraction limit

367
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,120
so that's great but they're difficult uh

368
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:02,079
they're thin samples you usually have to

369
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,158
use turf or evanescent illumination

370
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,119
which we'll have um they require the

371
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,280
tough part is really the buffers and the

372
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,519
flop for chemistry you can only use

373
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:15,200
certain Flores they generally cannot be

374
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:18,319
done live because the buffers are very

375
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,840
reducing um and it requires 10,000

376
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,399
images for each super resolution image

377
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,240
so that's sort of like 10 minutes of

378
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,480
blinking data which you guys all Miss

379
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,079
because I couldn't get it to run

380
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,440
so the other technology that we're going

381
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,839
to have um is super resolution

382
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,360
structured illumination microscopy so

383
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:43,279
the way that this works is that instead

384
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:47,959
of Illuminating uniformly you illuminate

385
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:50,720
um in a defraction um pattern and then

386
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,120
that pattern will beat with a spatial

387
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,000
frequencies in your sample they'll

388
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,759
create uh a beating pattern that's now

389
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,240
larger so you can pick it up with your

390
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:04,640
objective lens so this is how it's

391
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,880
implemented in the Zyra the system that

392
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,159
we're going to get so they this is

393
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,159
actually a three-dimensional D

394
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,679
defraction pattern right here what they

395
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,840
do is they basically mix orders of a

396
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,080
defraction

397
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:21,639
grading this is an example of an image

398
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:24,439
taken with that this is a polyene

399
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,000
chromosome um and basically looking at

400
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,720
heat shop factor and um it's in green

401
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,919
right here and polymerase is in Red so

402
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,360
you can see that you can really um

403
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,880
isolate complexes that you can't see in

404
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:42,399
the standard microscope

405
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,799
image so the super resolution structured

406
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,880
illumination microscopy Sr Sim um this

407
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:52,519
is easy so you basically can put your

408
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,799
sample on the stage and that's it uh you

409
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,918
can accommodate thicker samples not real

410
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,879
thick less than 20 microns it doesn't

411
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,559
require specialized Flor fores it only

412
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:08,039
requires around 15 images so that

413
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:11,480
corresponds to five rotations of this um

414
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:14,558
defraction pattern and three

415
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,640
translations um so it's relatively fast

416
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,759
um it can be done live and it results in

417
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,720
a resolution that's about two fold

418
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,319
better than defraction so there's no

419
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,759
such thing as a free lunch um so the

420
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:31,158
airies scan is going to be kind of

421
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:34,759
similar to that uh the structured

422
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,919
illumination microscopy so this uses a

423
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,879
detector array rather than a com focal

424
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,480
pinhole and a point scanning laser com

425
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,919
focal setup and this is expected to be

426
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,640
about the same as the SR Sim in terms of

427
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,720
resolution and ease of use um it's a

428
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,440
really new technology so there's not a

429
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,038
lot of data out there so we're kind of

430
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,400
excited to be getting this in the

431
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,839
spring so

432
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,480
the other thing that we have that's new

433
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:08,639
to us is the fluorescence activated cell

434
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,278
sorder or fax um so if you um have

435
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,960
suspension cells that you need to

436
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:16,159
separate by color or size um or if you

437
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,720
just need to analyze them this is an

438
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,799
instrument that you can use for laser

439
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,278
lines 12 emission colors specimen

440
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:27,599
cooling it sorts into tubes or plates um

441
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:32,919
and we can take biosafety level two

442
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:35,519
agents if that is of interest um and

443
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,679
then um other technologies that we have

444
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,079
are sort of loosely organized into

445
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,360
intravital Imaging and now this can

446
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:46,599
accommodate sort of bigger

447
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:50,399
specimens um they are noninvasive to

448
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:52,119
minimally invasive so the idea is um you

449
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,880
know a lot of them are set up for live

450
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,599
mice but you could do live plants as

451
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,000
well plants that are you know still in

452
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,639
their pot you image them take them back

453
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,359
then bring them back and image them

454
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,600
again if necessary so this would be

455
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,719
luminescence ultrasound CT and in some

456
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,839
cases

457
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,200
multiphoton this is an example of our

458
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,119
new uh high resolution ultrasound this

459
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,240
is a mouse heart beating um so it's good

460
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,798
at picking up motion and anatomical

461
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,519
structure it's not used a lot for plants

462
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,879
but I'm not really sure why this is an

463
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,960
image that my daughter took over the

464
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,520
weekend she's 10 years old so ultrasound

465
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,759
is really fast easy totally

466
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:38,079
noninvasive um and tissue can be sampled

467
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,720
or injected via uh image guided needle

468
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,678
placement if if you would need something

469
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,519
like that

470
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,320
um

471
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,798
yes it's

472
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:52,439
Doppler um or it can be depending on you

473
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:59,839
know how you use

474
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:02,798
it um so um visualization analysis we uh

475
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:06,399
support um a bunch of different image

476
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,960
analysis packages um we do some custom

477
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,679
written

478
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,880
algorithms um these are our winter

479
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,200
analysis uh image analysis workshops um

480
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,440
if you're interested in finally

481
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,960
analyzing all that data that you took or

482
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,320
interested in having your students

483
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,079
analyze all the data that you took um so

484
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:32,519
they going to be this um in between

485
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,519
break in break here so that's all I

486
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:39,879
have this has been a production of

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,880
Cornell University on the web at
