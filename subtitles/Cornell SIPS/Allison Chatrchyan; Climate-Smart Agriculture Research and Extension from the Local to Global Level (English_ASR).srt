1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,759
University okay thank you so much Louie

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,800
thank you so much um for that very nice

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,920
introduction um so I wanted to talk to

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,320
you today about something a little bit

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,599
different um I am a social scientist and

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,760
trained in environmental political

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,399
science and this concept of polycentric

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,120
governance is really important for

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,679
addressing climate change and I've used

11
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,519
it in my work um from the local level to

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,640
the global level looking at climate

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,320
change in

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,120
agriculture okay so a little bit about

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,640
me um I really have worked been

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:52,000
fortunate to work um at many different

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,079
levels and this feeds into my interest

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,920
in polycentric governance um I studied

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,600
at Colby College in Maine and then W

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,679
went to work on National Environmental

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,118
Policy issues in Washington DC as an

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,079
environmental consultant I then W and

23
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,799
worked at the United Nations environment

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:14,158
program on the Montreal protocol and

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,840
then finished my PhD at Maryland went to

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
work for extension well first I worked

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,880
for Bard College but then I went to work

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,519
for extension in the Hudson Valley

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,359
working on climate change and

30
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:30,239
environmental issues in that region so a

31
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,920
regional level and then um in between

32
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,438
there I've worked on issues in Armenia

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,118
focused my dissertation there and then

34
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,078
came to Cornell where I've been here for

35
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,159
10 years I just moved to this department

36
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,599
last fall or

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,840
last mid year uh before that I was with

38
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,199
art Deano in the earth and Atmospheric

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,200
science

40
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:57,359
department okay okay so what I want to

41
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,839
talk to you about today has anyone heard

42
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,239
of polycentric

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,960
governance wow how cool introducing this

44
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,280
to you so I'm going to talk about this

45
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,318
idea this concept and then I'm going to

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,280
introduce climate smart

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,878
agriculture um then I'm going to focus

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,640
on my stakeholder engaged research the

49
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,518
work that I've done with Debbie over the

50
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,559
past two years it should be wrapping up

51
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,920
very soon um looking at the impacts of

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,360
climate change to agriculture in New

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:33,958
York state and then look at my extension

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,879
work uh from a local to National and

55
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,680
Global

56
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,959
level

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,640
so if you think about climate change I

58
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,319
just asked my students this on Tuesday

59
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:50,518
how many of you would say it is a global

60
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:53,518
problem or a national problem or a local

61
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,519
problem

62
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,799
Global local all of the above all of the

63
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:04,238
above but it is a transboundary

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,719
environmental issue meaning that the

65
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,640
emissions that we and every country emit

66
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,840
through many sectors including

67
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,759
agriculture uh once those greenhouse

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,158
gases go up in the atmosphere they don't

69
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,399
stay over the United States it's a

70
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:23,239
transboundary issue so we have to have a

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,360
mechanism for addressing that uh with

72
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,719
many countries all countries involved

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,599
and this idea of climate governance is

74
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,959
the diplomacy

75
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:37,158
mechanisms and response measures aimed

76
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,400
at steering social systems towards

77
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:40,280
preventing mitigating and adapting to

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,280
climate

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,239
change okay and so this idea of

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,598
polycentric governance came about in the

81
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,959
40s and 50s it's a system of governance

82
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,479
with many centers of decisionmaking

83
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,280
authority that are needed to cover the

84
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,598
full range of govern governance tasks

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,000
so you all said that climate change is a

86
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:08,479
global and a national and a local issue

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,878
so will it be effective if just the

88
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,878
United Nations in uh unfc is addressing

89
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,759
this

90
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:21,879
issue no it won't we have to have every

91
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,280
national government addressing this we

92
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:29,038
also have to have many actors involved

93
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,198
at all levels so the the political

94
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:33,599
scientist

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,639
who really brought this issue to the

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,520
Forefront was elanar Ostrom she was

97
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,400
trained in political science but

98
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,079
received a Nobel Prize um in 2009 for

99
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:48,679
her work the she won the new the prize

100
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:51,478
in economics and she researched how do

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,038
communities that manage common pool

102
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:57,879
resources manage them successfully and

103
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:01,800
she her work really debunked the tragedy

104
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,719
of the commons so she developed these

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,280
principles of institutional design and

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,039
she really worked on smaller common pool

107
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:14,599
resources this is for example um a

108
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,918
Commons that is a fishery in Italy or

109
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,240
Spain how do those fishermen work

110
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:22,359
together or Fisher women work together

111
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,079
to manage that resource and she said

112
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,120
that in order to be effective you have

113
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,680
to have several things in place clear

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,360
group identity um rules that match local

115
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,199
needs rules that are devised by those

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,319
that are um managing the

117
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:43,919
resource um sanctions that are known and

118
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,960
graduated and then a responsibility to

119
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,599
to link up that management with

120
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,478
different levels of um different

121
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,600
interconnected systems so if there's a

122
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,639
common pool resource in Italy it has to

123
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,080
be managed within that small area but

124
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,120
then Italy and then up to uh the UN

125
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,758
level so Ostrom then later in her life

126
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,360
thought about this idea of climate

127
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:17,160
change as a Global Commons issue and she

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,759
then did some work and published a

129
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,199
really famous Report with the World Bank

130
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,680
arguing that we can manage the best way

131
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,960
to manage climate change as a global

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,160
issue is through polycentric governance

133
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,318
she said said that single policies

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,759
adopted by one agency like a top- down

135
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,639
approach is not going to be effective

136
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,080
and that leaving just a United Nations

137
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,240
or even thinking about the United States

138
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,918
to solve the problem will result in Free

139
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,439
Rider issues like some countries aren't

140
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:57,598
going to do enough and instead a very a

141
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:00,038
polycentric approach is needed um which

142
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,478
has oversight at the local

143
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:08,439
National Regional level with many

144
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:11,878
actors and so this idea is that you can

145
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,399
think about a ripple going out or

146
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,439
interconnected circles concentric

147
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,598
circles of action so when I say many

148
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,120
modes and domains of action if you think

149
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,719
about who is addressing climate change

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,360
globally it's just not it's not just

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,599
National governments or the United

152
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,199
Nations businesses are involved NOS are

153
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,159
involved research institutions like

154
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,080
Cornell are involved and we're trying to

155
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,319
work with Farmers on the ground uh

156
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:44,000
individuals to get them involved she

157
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,439
Ostrum said this approach is more

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
diverse with greater emphasis on a

159
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:54,439
bottomup approach it emphasizes

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,519
self-organization site specific um work

161
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,680
experimentation learning and Trust so

162
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,038
there's a greater number of actors we've

163
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,478
seen this burining number of actors

164
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:08,158
involved I had the opportunity to take

165
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:11,158
Cornell to the cop 28 meeting in Dubai

166
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:14,478
there were 880,000 people there so you

167
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:18,079
can see how many people are working on

168
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:21,120
climate change some opposed to it who

169
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,158
were there um but that also leads to

170
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,439
Greater complexity and

171
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:28,560
Innovation but also the need for

172
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,120
coordination and information sharing so

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,639
I think this is a good metaphor and a

174
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,918
good theory for thinking about the work

175
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,918
that we do here at Cornell when we're

176
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:43,079
doing research and we're um as I am

177
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:46,240
doing extension work we are getting

178
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,839
individuals involved we have to focus on

179
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,839
site specific needs we have to have

180
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,080
experimentation working with our

181
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,720
partners and so I'm going to now turn to

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,079
how I've used this just to show you that

183
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,519
this was an initiative from the un

184
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:06,359
climate agency to start to track all of

185
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,919
this action and you can go to their

186
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,360
website and look for their Global

187
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:16,039
Climate action tracker um individual

188
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,360
countries cities companies investors

189
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:22,078
organizations are encouraged to start to

190
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,600
tell the UN about their

191
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:28,519
actions and I have Incorporated this

192
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,240
into my research so this was a report

193
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,480
that I worked on um that looked at

194
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,759
Global Food security and multi-level

195
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,159
governance just the idea that we for

196
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,278
going to address Global Food insecurity

197
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,319
we have these International agreements

198
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,439
the Paris agreement we have trade

199
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
agreements um that are setting these

200
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,440
goals but then they need to be

201
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,200
implemented at a national level and then

202
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,480
they need to be implemented on a local

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,759
level with Farmers or agricultural

204
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,920
producers have to be able to make change

205
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,879
so this is just an example of some of

206
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,199
the work that I've done with uh

207
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,600
interdisiplinary colleagues here at

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Cornell that have used these ideas and

209
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,399
looked at non-state actors looked at

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,958
subnational governments um looked at how

211
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,278
politicians are tweeting about climate

212
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:26,359
change not not a government

213
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:29,799
agency so I'll turn now to a little bit

214
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,240
more about my stakeholder engaged

215
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:35,679
research stakeholder is a term that's

216
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,519
thrown out all the time and I think it's

217
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,399
important to Define it um Dan Decker

218
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,759
taught at Cornell for many years in

219
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,240
natural resources department he defined

220
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,360
it as a stakeholder is any citizen or

221
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,799
group potentially affected by or with a

222
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,759
vested interest in an issue a program an

223
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:57,958
action or a decision so we know through

224
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,159
research from many social scientists

225
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,518
that if we are designing an extension

226
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:06,120
program or we're developing decision

227
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,600
tools they are not going to be effective

228
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,679
unless we know what stakeholders

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,480
understand what they need how they're

230
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,199
going to use the tools or the

231
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,039
information and this is summarized well

232
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,320
by this quote by Bartels who says any

233
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,039
process to engage stakeholders around

234
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,040
the issue of climate change that fails

235
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,679
to systematically understand and

236
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,399
incorporate their views their values

237
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,679
beliefs and identities is likely to not

238
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,399
be

239
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:39,078
effective so um when I first came to

240
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:42,759
Cornell 10 years ago and worked with

241
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:45,638
many colleagues um including art Deano

242
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,600
and others here we thought about the

243
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,560
fact that we wanted to understand what

244
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,480
stakeholders knew about climate change

245
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,479
what Farmers understood and then develop

246
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,159
our decision support tools and our

247
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,720
extension programs and this is not just

248
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:06,159
a one-way process we really want input a

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,920
two-way process from those that are

250
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:12,439
going to use our

251
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,919
information so I'll explain how I've

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,040
used this with this concept of climate

253
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,599
smart agriculture how many of you have

254
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:23,719
heard of the term yeah I great that's

255
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,000
great so I would say this term it was

256
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,959
developed by the UN food and agriculture

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,399
organization about 10 12 years ago it's

258
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:38,278
come to much greater prominence now um

259
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,360
both globally many countries that have

260
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,480
developed their nationally determined

261
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,199
contributions to the Paris agreement

262
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,320
have included climate smart agriculture

263
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:52,639
for mitigation and adaptation and in the

264
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,440
United States um two years ago Biden

265
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,919
Administration announced they would have

266
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,399
a climate smart Commodities program to

267
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,599
funnel billions of dollars through

268
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,559
grants including one at Cornell with New

269
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,199
York state to Farmers to adopt climate

270
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,479
smart agriculture practices so I'm glad

271
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:14,319
you've heard of the term it's really a

272
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,600
three-pronged approach it focuses on

273
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,040
mitigation um sustainably increasing

274
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,879
food productivity and income and then

275
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:28,159
strengthening resilience or adaptation

276
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,879
so adaptation mitigation and increasing

277
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,559
food uction

278
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,679
sustainably so the work that I've done

279
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,000
at

280
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:43,039
Cornell over the past 10 years has used

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,919
that framework um as a starting point um

282
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,078
when I first came in 2017 I worked on a

283
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,759
meta analysis looking at us agriculture

284
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,958
stakeholder views and decisions on

285
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,919
climate change that was published in

286
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:59,399
wires climate change and then with a

287
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,240
postto David Lane and others including

288
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,958
colleagues from the Northeast climate

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,959
Hub we did conducted focus groups with

290
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,078
farmers in

291
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,879
Pennsylvania uh New York State and

292
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,958
Wisconsin to understand what are they

293
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,919
experiencing what are their views on

294
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:21,958
climate change and what actions are they

295
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:25,319
taking in general we found that farmers

296
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,319
are experience extreme weather extreme

297
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,079
weather events and they're more likely

298
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,240
to take action on their arms either to

299
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,679
mitigate or adapt if they've experienced

300
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,039
climate change

301
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:41,559
personally and they're more likely to to

302
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,480
be willing to adapt um many farmers are

303
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:47,799
still very skeptical of this human

304
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,240
causation of climate change so this

305
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:54,039
there is a need to keep um understanding

306
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,519
these views if they're changing over

307
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:58,838
time so with the climate smart farming

308
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,839
program at Cornell we also conducted

309
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,839
local interviews and captured videos of

310
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,079
farmers I love this quote from Tor

311
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,240
Ashner if you've met him he Farms about

312
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,479
a thousand acres of organic grain in

313
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,120
Newfield New York and when we

314
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,959
interviewed him a few years ago now he

315
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,959
said a normal season does not seem like

316
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,799
it happens anymore it's either really

317
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,278
dry or really wet it seems like when we

318
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,958
get rain it's

319
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,159
apocalyptic we got 5 Ines of rain in

320
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,719
about an hour and a half and I had a lot

321
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:37,198
of soil loss I can see the impact for

322
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,120
Generations what interestingly when we

323
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,159
talked with him about there's a a

324
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,159
wonderful map from the U National

325
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,838
Climate assessment that shows that the

326
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:51,519
Northeast region has seen a 55% increase

327
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,959
in extreme rainfall events so when we

328
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,759
are getting rain it's coming in these

329
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:59,318
heavy downpours he wasn't aware that

330
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:02,440
this was connected to climate change

331
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:05,719
this was a few years ago um he knew it

332
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,160
was happening on his farm and he felt

333
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,759
the impact of soil loss and erosion but

334
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,198
he didn't connect it to global climate

335
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,919
change so this is important to be

336
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,758
talking to Farmers and helping them make

337
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,919
these

338
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:26,079
connections so with funding from um

339
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:28,958
multi-state hatch project I conducted a

340
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,719
survey of New York State farmers with

341
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:36,000
colleagues including shaa alred who's

342
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:40,879
who's was at Cornell and now is at UNC

343
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,919
um and we conducted a random sample of

344
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,639
New York State farmers um we had I just

345
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:51,000
want to make the point that doing a

346
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:54,560
survey is very challenging to to do it

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,240
well and to be able to publish the work

348
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:00,559
it has to be very rigorous and connected

349
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,959
to the theory so you have to have uh a

350
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,399
research question that you want to

351
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:09,798
understand develop the survey questions

352
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:13,400
to try to ascertain data that will

353
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:18,318
answer that research question and then

354
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:22,120
you can't just um use a survey sample

355
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:27,199
from like sending it out with extension

356
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:30,558
to Farmers you can but that's not a uh

357
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,600
rigorous survey that is random sample so

358
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:37,678
we USDA is also very particular about

359
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:43,480
farmer data and they will not provide

360
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:47,600
you with contact names for Farmers um we

361
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,599
also have this concept of survey fatigue

362
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,558
we need to be really careful that we're

363
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:55,399
not overs serving the farmers that we're

364
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,879
working with so we actually had to

365
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,280
purchase a sample through a magazine

366
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,840
that actually goes to Farmers across the

367
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:07,599
United States and they gave us very

368
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:11,000
accurate and updated um Farmers um

369
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:13,158
including their address phone and email

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,599
we then developed we didn't have funding

371
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,280
to do a mailed survey so we used the

372
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:22,038
Cornell uh qualtrix tool we did an

373
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:25,798
online survey that was sent out to 3,400

374
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:29,119
Farmers we got a response completion of

375
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:33,200
524 surveys which is a response rate of

376
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,319
15% which is really high for survey work

377
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,120
um then we did a non-response survey

378
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:40,798
with 26 completions to make sure that

379
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:43,000
the responses we were getting were not

380
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,359
biased and we found through our

381
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,480
non-response survey that they were were

382
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:51,240
were not so what did we find well first

383
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,038
of all we asked questions about how

384
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,640
Farmers viewed climate change the

385
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:58,960
actions they were taking to mitigate and

386
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,919
adapt to climate change whether they

387
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,840
were taking those actions because of

388
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:07,720
climate change or just because they

389
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,240
were adopting no till because it's a

390
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,679
good practice to adopt and then we asked

391
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,960
them several questions about decision

392
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,759
tools and precision

393
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,319
Agriculture and we found that 83% of the

394
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,359
farmers surveyed have experienced

395
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:27,240
extreme weather events that affected

396
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:31,079
their Farm in the past five years and

397
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,960
57% of farmers felt they did not have

398
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:36,279
the financial capacity or the capacity

399
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,480
to address climate change so there is a

400
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:42,960
real need for providing support and

401
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,279
funding to Farmers we also found that

402
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,279
68% of the farmers that responded were

403
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:52,279
concerned or very concerned about

404
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:54,279
drought 64% were concerned or very

405
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:57,119
concerned about extreme

406
00:19:54,279 --> 00:20:00,359
precipitation for adaptation practices

407
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:03,000
you can see what they were

408
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,439
utilizing for decision tools

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,480
interestingly 63% of those we asked were

410
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,558
not using any apps or smartphones or

411
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,240
mobile devices to inform their

412
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:17,798
management decisions this was a few

413
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,359
years ago now but um I think this is

414
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:22,720
probably you know the large farmers in

415
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,839
New York state are probably using

416
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,600
Precision Agriculture and they're

417
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:31,199
working with Consultants the smaller and

418
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:34,519
medium size farmers they may be using

419
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,519
weather apps but they're not using more

420
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:40,679
in-depth decision tools the barriers we

421
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,879
found were uh the top three responses

422
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,919
were I'm not aware of these tools

423
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,440
they're too costly or they don't apply

424
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,440
to my

425
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,558
farm and another uh bit of information

426
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,159
we asked about specific resources they

427
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:57,240
were using uh they

428
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,840
were uh some were using the US drought

429
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,679
monitor uh the Farmers

430
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:07,279
Almanac and the weather channel was the

431
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:09,559
biggest s uh tool they were using um and

432
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,839
farmers of the farmers who were not

433
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,519
using tools who were interested they

434
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,839
were interested in the climate smart

435
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,158
Farming tools and the northeast regional

436
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,918
climate Center

437
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,520
data so I want to do a small shout out

438
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,720
to Louie um through philli I've made a

439
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,158
connection in the hallway being upstairs

440
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,319
on the 10th floor which is awesome and

441
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,240
realized um that we have this data from

442
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:39,839
this Statewide survey that we haven't

443
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:43,278
published yet and Louie has uh conducted

444
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,879
interviews with Farms um and an started

445
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:48,480
to analyze them and has funding to do a

446
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,278
survey in New York and we can do what's

447
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,558
called a mixed method analysis combine

448
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:56,880
these data sets and have a richer um

449
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,399
analysis and understanding of how

450
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
farmers are thinking about farm

451
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,400
digitization and

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,880
experimentation so now I want to quickly

453
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,798
talk about the New York State climate

454
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,080
impacts assessment project that I've

455
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:15,440
worked on with Debbie Aller and several

456
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,599
other faculty at Cornell and other

457
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,400
organizations um this has been a hugely

458
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:24,079
in-depth project we're super excited

459
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,278
it's coming to an end soon it should be

460
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,119
published very soon if you have worked

461
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,640
with climate change in New York state

462
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,278
you know that the previous assessment

463
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,320
was the clim a report and I use that all

464
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:39,558
the time in my work it's very it's an

465
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,879
analogous to the National Climate

466
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:45,240
assessment but for New York State or the

467
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,640
ipcc assessments that are done for a

468
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:53,400
global level so this was the task of our

469
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,520
chapter was to look at how climate

470
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,000
impacts the agriculture sector since the

471
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:02,278
last report and we used a really

472
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,519
rigorous methodology these were our

473
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,240
participants we had a very strong

474
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,119
advisory committee that read the drafts

475
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,759
and

476
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:14,319
participated and the climate change data

477
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,400
was updated by Columbia

478
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,798
University um so you can see here these

479
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,320
are the projected annual average

480
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,839
temperature in New York state um during

481
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,678
the 20th 21st century um historical

482
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,038
observation since 1901 average

483
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,519
temperatures in New York state have

484
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:34,839
increased by 2.5 degrees

485
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,558
Fahrenheit um and the projections for

486
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,879
the future really depend on the

487
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:43,918
emissions that we and everyone around

488
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,799
the globe um emits so there's a range

489
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,240
there but temperatures could rise

490
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:53,359
between five an additional 5 to 11

491
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,079
degrees Fahrenheit by the 2080s which

492
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,599
would really

493
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:02,278
be catastrophic so we need to address

494
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,599
try to bring those emissions down you

495
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,599
can see the data for

496
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,199
precipitation um total annual

497
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,798
precipitation in New York state has

498
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,159
increased from 1901 to

499
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,000
2022 and the fastest increase has

500
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,120
occurred since the early

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,759
1980s and we will in with projections we

502
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:26,678
will see an increase of between 9 to 12%

503
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,440
by the 2080s you know this is a blessing

504
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,519
and a curse if you think think about the

505
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,519
South Western United States my colleague

506
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,639
Toby Al in Earth and Atmospheric science

507
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,839
has studied Mega droughts and where

508
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,200
agriculture much of it is produced in

509
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:44,119
Southern California those areas are

510
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,240
going to be much much more dry in the

511
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:50,158
future so we uh are going to have water

512
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,359
in New York state but the way that we

513
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,880
receive that water is very challenging

514
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,599
for Farmers it comes in these heavy

515
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,919
rainfall events

516
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,558
and we also know that the plant

517
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,080
hardiness zones for New York State and

518
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,319
the entire country have changed we're

519
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,960
seeing warmer Winters and longer growing

520
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,158
seasons and changes in plant hardiness

521
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,319
zones that have shifted across the

522
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,320
Northeast if you're interested you can

523
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,558
look up the plant hardiness zone maps

524
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:22,519
from

525
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,319
USDA so the key findings are that

526
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,398
there's five key findings from this

527
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,558
impacts assessment um the key findings I

528
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,319
won't into detail you can read it maybe

529
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:35,918
we'll send it around to the department

530
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:38,200
when it comes out um the most severe

531
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,120
impacts are extreme precipitation

532
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,798
short-term drought heat stress warmer

533
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:46,798
Winters late spring freeze increased

534
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:49,158
press pressure and production costs the

535
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,720
second finding is that climate change is

536
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:55,039
a threat multiplier we did a lot of work

537
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,159
interviewing Farmers talking to our

538
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,038
advisory committee and climate change

539
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,399
may not be the number one challenge

540
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:05,200
they're facing they may be facing labor

541
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:07,678
shortages or production costs Rising but

542
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,519
climate change makes all these other

543
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,360
issues it exacerbates these

544
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,679
stressors um the third key finding is

545
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,439
that we see that farmers and a

546
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,480
stakeholders show awareness and

547
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,200
acknowledgement of climate change

548
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,240
impacts on agriculture this is really a

549
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,240
big I think shift that I've seen in the

550
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,440
last 10 years of my work here

551
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,200
um key finding four farmers are

552
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,240
implementing and investing in

553
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,159
practices um but they need support and

554
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,798
funding and information to make those

555
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,200
changes and the fifth key finding is

556
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,200
that enhancing technical support

557
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,000
financial assistance and research is

558
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,519
critical for Farmers we also conducted

559
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,679
um really interesting case

560
00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:00,119
studies and you can see this wonderful

561
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,120
quote from a local Dairy it's hard to

562
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,519
invest in the farm when there's so much

563
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,959
uncertainty about whether dairy prices

564
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:10,960
will break even

565
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,038
um and we this is a challenge we saw

566
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,038
many small farms across the hills and

567
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,079
now there are only three Farms left in

568
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,519
this

569
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:22,119
Valley so in the last couple of minutes

570
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,960
I'll turn to my work on extension

571
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:27,599
Outreach and education um I've talked

572
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,240
about this before in for this group

573
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,759
group so I won't uh spend time but uh we

574
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,278
developed a climate smart farming

575
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:39,558
website and tools that you can play

576
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:42,159
around with they're free for any farmer

577
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,798
from the Northeast um in the Northeast

578
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,200
from Maine to West Virginia and farmers

579
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:51,240
can enter specific data about their

580
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,720
Farms we also are based on this concept

581
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,960
of climate smart agriculture so see

582
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,640
these are some of the tools that we have

583
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,840
the growing degree day calcul is shown

584
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,960
here it's it can go back in time um you

585
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,319
can change the growing degree day base

586
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,319
that is built for right now for corn

587
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:13,678
showing corn and it will show a farmer

588
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,720
in the season where they are with their

589
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,960
crop capturing growing degre day

590
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,558
accumulation units or they can look at

591
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,640
past seasons and see how that has

592
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,079
changed and make really management

593
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,480
decisions this is our extension team

594
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,759
including Candace hbert who's just

595
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,640
joined Johannes and I and art Deano and

596
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:40,480
Debbie and I've done a lot of work um I

597
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,080
would like to do more um but I've done

598
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,480
work going out to Farms with our

599
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:50,480
extension team um most recently we were

600
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,759
at the a society Forum in Syracuse with

601
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,480
our display and getting youth to answer

602
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,240
a survey and then I was in Albany on

603
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,038
Monday um a lot of interest in climate

604
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,480
smart farming this is another program

605
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,519
that I'm running this spring with the

606
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,278
USDA climate Hub it is a dairy climate

607
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,440
adaptation fellowship program I love

608
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:15,240
this program it's super interesting we

609
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,720
are training pairs of Da Farmers with an

610
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,519
advisor and it's a nine-week training

611
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,360
program and then we're going to do field

612
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,679
events and they're going to develop an

613
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,398
adaptation and mitigation plan for their

614
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,320
farm this

615
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:30,158
year another program that I developed

616
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,200
here at Cornell is the CL Cornell

617
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,799
climate stewards program it's modeled

618
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,319
after the Master Gardener program we've

619
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:42,000
had Farmers take the training and do a

620
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,759
project so they're they're not only just

621
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,079
getting trained on climate science and

622
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,398
impacts but they agree to do a project

623
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:52,038
in their community so far we've trained

624
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:54,558
94 climate stewards from 15 counties

625
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:57,558
including those extension Educators from

626
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,879
out in the counties and lastly I'm now

627
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:03,398
working with Johannes and Candace on

628
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,720
this AI climate Institute I hope we can

629
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:10,199
share more information about it over the

630
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,399
next five years the idea is that Ai and

631
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,840
machine learning and large amounts of

632
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:20,599
data can improve decision tools and

633
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:24,720
understanding and decision making of

634
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:28,439
policy makers and Farmers to be able to

635
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:32,200
better address and solve climate change

636
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:35,399
by improving mitigation and adaptation

637
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,278
so Candace and I and johanes um we are

638
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,639
working on the stakeholder assessment

639
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,558
component so we'll be conducting focus

640
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,840
groups and surveys with farmers and

641
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:48,480
policy makers about Ai and climate smart

642
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,359
agriculture we're already out doing

643
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,319
training as we get more information and

644
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:57,638
we're planning to do for example a 4 AG

645
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,000
career explow activity this summer and

646
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,359
we're doing

647
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,519
Outreach I guess the final thing I'll

648
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,439
say is that I've worked on this issue

649
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,880
from the local to the global level I've

650
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,120
been very fortunate to lead Cornell's

651
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,760
delegation to the cop since cup 21 and I

652
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:17,479
um get a badge every for the past five

653
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,359
years from the government of Armenia so

654
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,839
I can go in the a um agriculture

655
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:25,759
negotiations really see how the

656
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:28,119
countries are working on this issue what

657
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,398
they care about and help with the

658
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,759
negotiations um this year was in Dubai

659
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,959
um we had several students and faculty

660
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:40,038
go with us I was part of an event on

661
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,240
climate smart agriculture we saw John KY

662
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:46,278
walk by and said hey we're from

663
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,359
Cornell um and this is the agriculture

664
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:52,200
negotiations so I believe it's really

665
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,879
important to be at this Global level

666
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,278
with our climate smart agriculture

667
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,440
research so these are key takeaways

668
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:04,359
stakeholder engagement is key extension

669
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,120
education is critical training and

670
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:11,240
Outreach we won't get Farmers to adopt

671
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:15,000
practices um without training them and

672
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,120
policy engagement is key and I would end

673
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,480
by saying climate change affects

674
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:23,038
everything and begins with each of us

675
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,720
and what we can do in our communities

676
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:28,440
this is my son Robert he's now a

677
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,880
freshman at Cornell and he's studying

678
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,519
viticulture yay so you might have him in

679
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,480
your classes and

680
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,919
um get involved just like

681
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,919
ripples um spread out when dropped in

682
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,038
the water the actions of individuals can

683
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:49,480
have far-reaching

684
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:49,480
effects so thank you yeah Judy

685
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,559
um across state um you and there's a

686
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,519
variety of farming practices across New

687
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:02,038
York State caring fr uh you you separate

688
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,759
them out in any way and if you did would

689
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,759
you think that they have a different

690
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,759
response to some of your

691
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,798
questions that's a great question for

692
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,840
the focus group research we did we did a

693
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,798
focus group is a group interview and you

694
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,678
want to have like-minded people in the

695
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:25,359
room you want to have about a Max of 10

696
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,120
farmers in a room and we did have

697
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,638
separate commodity groups so we had a

698
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:33,759
focus group with vegetable Growers Dairy

699
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:36,079
fruit and vegetable so that data was

700
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,440
what that we got was based on different

701
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,839
commodity groups the survey that I did

702
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,679
of New York State farmers we we asked

703
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,638
them what they're growing and what their

704
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,880
commodity was but we didn't

705
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:49,319
differentiate the practices

706
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,559
out but that could be something that we

707
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:54,599
think of in the

708
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:59,200
future thank

709
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:03,359
you yeah hi I'm wondering in the results

710
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,360
of from your survey have you observed a

711
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:10,519
significant a significant difference of

712
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:15,679
climate impact across different um

713
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:18,398
practices for example um a for or crop

714
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,358
um like that yeah that's a great

715
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:25,719
question the survey that um I did in New

716
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,598
York state we didn't we didn't ask them

717
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,358
that um

718
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,200
it was an online survey and we had to be

719
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,398
really careful about limiting the number

720
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,358
of questions um that could be certainly

721
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:42,358
something we think about for the future

722
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:45,119
um hopefully with Louie we're doing a

723
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:46,918
survey maybe a smaller scale in New York

724
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,599
state or with Candace we could think

725
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:53,598
about that thank

726
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:58,320
you Al I have a question sort of follow

727
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:00,559
from Jes your takeaway number for you

728
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,760
have the this totally about what their

729
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,039
practices are and it sounds like you

730
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,839
have sort of partitioned out user groups

731
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,358
with the tools that they're using the

732
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:13,119
best BS bmps whatever it happens to be

733
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,880
have you actually done that at this

734
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,440
point where you can sort of say these

735
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,119
are the things that they're doing and

736
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,838
then can that be linked to effects and

737
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,358
implications of that kind of stuff no

738
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,000
but interestingly I I took that slide

739
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,799
out but um Debbie and I worked hard in

740
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,639
the New York State climate impact

741
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,440
assessment the nerta really wanted in

742
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,039
this impacts assessment to have a focus

743
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,159
on adaptation not only understanding the

744
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,960
impacts but what are the adaptations

745
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,679
that we can recommend so with our team

746
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,199
we came up with a table that is

747
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,879
differentiated so we know that the

748
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,799
climate impacts to dairy or vegetable

749
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,240
Growers are different and they're also

750
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,400
different based on the region where you

751
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:02,519
are so they're very particular um so the

752
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,559
table has

753
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:09,358
suggested adaptations for dairy for

754
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,559
field crops for fruit for aquaculture

755
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:16,159
and that is something that we could

756
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:19,279
follow up with and see you know B sector

757
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:21,838
which our Farmers really adopting these

758
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,960
practices because of climate impacts are

759
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,318
they just adopting them because they're

760
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,000
good practices and and then

761
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:32,358
with folks like Matt Ryan or others you

762
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,400
know doing long-term studies to measure

763
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:37,000
the effectiveness on agriculture systems

764
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,400
would be really

765
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,480
important did that answer your question

766
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,240
did sort of I my immediate response to

767
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,599
that is that in since I'd be more on the

768
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:49,598
Louis end of the spectrum or saying

769
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,200
rather than say this is your research

770
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,400
these guys are doing research on their

771
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,039
Farms yeah intentionally or not yes

772
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,760
those are the people that should be

773
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,440
teaching we shouldn't be telling what

774
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,040
you should do you should basically use

775
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,880
these as demonstrations oh yes that's a

776
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:08,440
great idea research becomes the Grower's

777
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,680
research not Cornell's research sure yep

778
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,200
uh that's kind of what we're doing with

779
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,480
the dairy climate adaptation Fellowship

780
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,639
um there's four of those programs

781
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,079
running right now we are running the

782
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:25,000
dairy one but we're partnering with it's

783
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,960
a peer training mod model we're

784
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,760
partnering a farmer with a consultant

785
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,280
and then they're going to go out and

786
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,119
actually do develop an implementation

787
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,680
plan for their farm and they have to

788
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,240
share what they're doing with us and

789
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,639
with other

790
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,679
farmers and we're we're it just seems

791
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,318
that you've got a natural experiment

792
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,960
going on yeah that we could take

793
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:51,519
advantage of that's a great Point yeah

794
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,159
yeah thank

795
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:58,358
you yeah I said I would only ask easy

796
00:37:55,159 --> 00:38:00,399
questions an easy question actually how

797
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:03,119
does this information get back to the

798
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,760
legislature is there a structural is

799
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,760
there a structural relation in which all

800
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,720
this information of the assessment is

801
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,240
presented legislature in the n in the

802
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:17,480
New York State climate assessment yeah

803
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:21,039
that um definitely will happen um this

804
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,760
was driven by New York state nerta

805
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:27,880
agency with um it was we were appointed

806
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,000
by Governor hokel um so there will there

807
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,838
is a similar mitigation work and we were

808
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,880
the adapt impacts and adaptation work so

809
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,679
I think there's going to be a stronger

810
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,119
effort to get the information out and

811
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,199
make sure it's used I was thinking that

812
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,280
certain regulations that might be in law

813
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:47,799
might need to be changed according

814
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,440
changing circumstances yes great Point

815
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,240
yeah what have you found is the planning

816
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,639
horiz for the farmers so if you only

817
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,959
plan for three or four years you might

818
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,519
react very differently to the

819
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,720
recommendations than it plan for 20 30

820
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:06,639
years that's a great point I think

821
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:09,838
Debbie did some interviews with grape

822
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:14,239
Growers and D do you want to chime in we

823
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:17,799
know that perennial crops those farmers

824
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:20,039
are much more aware of climate impacts

825
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,318
yeah certainly areas by commodity and a

826
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,719
big part of it is how much um does an

827
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:27,039
individual farmer experience the impact

828
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:29,598
of climate change

829
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,159
and a big part is the financial side of

830
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,318
things the ability of a farmer to

831
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,719
actually have the financial capacity to

832
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,838
implement adaptation practices so

833
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,318
certain practices that can be adopted by

834
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,239
perennial Fruit Growers and the costs

835
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:44,960
around those for example like wi

836
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:48,679
machines which are more than like

837
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,880
$30,000 for a single wi machine that's a

838
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,199
huge upfront investment by the farmers

839
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,440
the ability for them to adopt practice

840
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,960
like that they need to have a long-term

841
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,838
vision for their Farm as well so it's a

842
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,240
really good question in terms of a

843
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,559
planning process and it varies Farm by

844
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,318
farm and

845
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,318
across

846
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:11,400
great yeah Harold yeah so I was

847
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:13,480
wondering and I really appreciate your

848
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,039
presentation in your report that there

849
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,079
are some negative Trends in agriculture

850
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,800
for example the dairy industry has

851
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,160
really gone to corn cided production

852
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,560
over foren your

853
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,440
forages and um and so cornide is much

854
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,559
less zillion that you know creates a lot

855
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,599
more runoff potential and things like

856
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,519
that does the report sort of address

857
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,000
some of those issues as well that

858
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,239
basically nutritionists are are

859
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,480
promoting one size production and it is

860
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,919
more efficient for you know in terms of

861
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,679
milk production but it's not very good

862
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,000
for climate adapt it's a negative

863
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:48,519
climate adaptation yeah is that being

864
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,559
addressed because those are some of the

865
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:54,519
tough questions that people don't want

866
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:57,039
to hear you know right we do we did try

867
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:01,800
really hard to look at um issues like

868
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:05,000
that um the complex issues between um

869
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,280
economics we had a whole section I'm not

870
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,079
I can't remember if we

871
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,519
actually had a struction on that

872
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:17,760
specific issue but I will keep it in

873
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,759
mind thank

874
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,239
you
