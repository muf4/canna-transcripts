1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,349
University hey good afternoon everyone

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,679
so I'll get straight into it so here in

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,809
in the central region of New York we

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,789
have grape vines that are cultivated

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:21,570
around the Finger Lakes and this is

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:26,099
because of some special characteristics

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,179
of the area and you can see here in in

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:34,500
this map that you're seeing this is the

10
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:37,530
USDA hardiness zone map and you can see

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,289
in green where where the area with them

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,009
with a milder climate extends from the

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,039
Great Lakes

14
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:46,558
further south because of because of the

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,420
Finger Lakes so it is because of these

16
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,109
characteristics that we are able to

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,359
cultivate grapevines of the vanilla kind

18
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,429
around here and you can see that if you

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,920
look at the map of where we have

20
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:02,939
wineries in the state of New York you

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,260
see that they are located where those

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:09,509
green areas in the map to the left is so

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,060
there's climate characteristics that are

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,090
that become milder because of these

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,329
large bodies of water that we see here

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,770
in the in the in the western part of New

27
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:26,250
York and but still there's some years

28
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:28,649
where the temperatures drop there are

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,000
too low so we we are studying cold

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,280
hardiness and grapes to try to

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,259
understand what are the characteristics

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
and the wild grapevines that make them

33
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,219
survive even further north from here and

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,359
that the cultivated grapevines are not

35
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,039
that they don't have so here it's just

36
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,530
to show you there's there's different

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,689
characteristics for each of the Finger

38
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,200
Lakes so it's a combination of the

39
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:58,158
geography and the the depth of the lakes

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,560
and the the surface area of them that

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,979
prevents them from in most winters from

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,960
freezing and because of that they have a

43
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:10,649
they buffer the especially the low

44
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,680
temperatures in the area and then you

45
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,509
might tell me but global warming

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,120
we're increasing the temperatures why is

47
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,429
your study relevant why do we need to

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,610
understand cold hardiness if we're not

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,459
gonna need it in the near future and

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,549
then I'll tell you here in these maps we

51
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,549
sees as the winter temperatures are

52
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:35,370
increasing and even the extremes in

53
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,769
temperature are going up and this is

54
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,019
basically based on that the low

55
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,920
temperatures are rising it's not the the

56
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,780
highs but the low temperatures and the

57
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,568
reason why it's still relevant is

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,079
because of this type of phenomenon that

59
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:54,030
still is going to occur the polar

60
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,659
vortexes that we've been seeing with

61
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,489
greater frequency it's not just because

62
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:01,638
we came up with a name for them but they

63
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,700
actually have increased in frequency

64
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:08,670
lately because as the as the air warms

65
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,979
in the southern regions it decreases the

66
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:13,229
strength of that that Jetstream and

67
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,988
because of that it's able to move

68
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:18,780
further south and then the the arctic

69
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,239
air moves further south so we're we're

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,419
still going to see low extremes in

71
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,489
temperature even though the winter

72
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,319
temperatures are milder and hopefully by

73
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,128
the end of this presentation you'll able

74
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:34,828
to make your own conclusions and how

75
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:36,750
because of how grapevines are perceiving

76
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:42,030
temperatures they might still be

77
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:45,598
affected by by these events so because

78
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,509
of the the seminar was titled grapevine

79
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,728
survival winter Survival Guide I decided

80
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,689
to talk about fight-or-flight responses

81
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,079
and the grapevines

82
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:57,449
and so this is the the sort of thing

83
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,180
like a general grapevine that you have

84
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,489
in the late summer with the fruit the

85
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,469
first thing that leaves the grapevine

86
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,189
are the fruit that we're picking and

87
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:11,189
then as it as the the days become

88
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,439
shorter and the quality of light changes

89
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:16,098
you start getting the dormancy

90
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:21,329
established so you get into fall and

91
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:23,430
once those so those leaves are in the

92
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,560
flight response so they're going to get

93
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,000
away but part of that plant is still

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,310
going to be there so

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,740
have all the doorman structures that

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,329
have to resist the winter temperatures

97
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,470
so I'm gonna talk about especially the

98
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:40,769
today what I'm going to talk about is

99
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,600
how the the buds of the plants are going

100
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:46,469
to survive the winter and how they

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,150
respond to temperature some of the

102
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,580
things that I'll be talking about end or

103
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:53,279
dormancy what is in the dormancy if you

104
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:56,009
cut a bud off of a plant and you try to

105
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,539
grow it very early in the winter when it

106
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,039
hasn't seen or felt any cold it's

107
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,410
basically not going to grow you can see

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,180
here this cutting it grows roots but

109
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,300
it's not developing that bud so you're

110
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,900
not seeing bud break in here it's not

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,480
growing

112
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:17,219
whereas when they're in equal doormen

113
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,680
you actually see the you see the the

114
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,630
buds start to grow very quickly and if

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,030
you compare the sizes of the roots

116
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:27,360
you'll see that the this started growing

117
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:29,159
much earlier than the roots and so the

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,490
transition from this end or dormant

119
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,770
state which is a non responsive state

120
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,810
into an eco dormant state where if you

121
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:40,069
give enough temperatures they'll start

122
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,560
growing it is understood as being a

123
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,750
response to chill accumulation so the

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,149
plants have a clock in which they're

125
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:53,009
counting how many hours they're spanning

126
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:56,250
in low temperatures typically calculated

127
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:58,349
between zero and eleven Celsius

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,399
somewhere in that range depending on

129
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:06,000
what what model you're using and so if

130
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,250
we look at the at the map for chilling

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,290
accumulation here in the US you'll see

132
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,319
that if you go further north you have

133
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:17,100
more chilling compared to the south but

134
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,139
if you look at at the Midwest region

135
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,030
you'll see that it actually has less

136
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,009
chilling or it's comparable to the

137
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,918
southern regions that's because they

138
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,289
spend so much time in the below freezing

139
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,149
temperatures during midwinter that they

140
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,280
really don't accumulate chilling so the

141
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:36,179
plants don't count that into their clock

142
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,799
so you have that in mid to high

143
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,720
latitudes that's really where you have

144
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,860
most of your chill accumulation and then

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,500
if you go

146
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,158
further north you don't you don't see

147
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,050
that anymore so here just so you can see

148
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:51,658
some data and it depends on the year

149
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,060
also that you're looking at so this is a

150
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:57,240
warm year and you see that here in New

151
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,158
York and Missouri you're going to 1600

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,418
hours and in South Dakota you only get a

153
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:07,199
thousand whereas if we have a very very

154
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:09,899
cold winter like 2013 2014 we actually

155
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,080
have less chilly accumulated and here in

156
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:15,778
the New York Region much closer to a

157
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,269
South Dakota gets so it really

158
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:21,478
fluctuates the responses of the plants

159
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:25,408
fluctuate from winter to winter I'll

160
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:27,839
also be talking a lot about differential

161
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:30,778
thermal analysis or LTE's or the term

162
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,688
that you're gonna hear me say this is

163
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:36,538
the analysis that we do to evaluate the

164
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:39,840
cold hardiness of these buds so we cut

165
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,060
them off of the plant we cut them off of

166
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,218
the plant and we're careful to leave

167
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,978
some of the bud cushon because this is

168
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:49,709
important for them to still have this

169
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:52,468
phenotype that we're measuring we put

170
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:57,209
them in these thermoelectric modules

171
00:07:52,468 --> 00:08:00,778
that are that measure changes in voltage

172
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:02,278
based on on Heat and so we have these

173
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:04,860
large plates and we put them in a

174
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:07,259
programmable freezer which is going to

175
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
lower the temperature until minus 40

176
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,300
Celsius

177
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:15,240
and then we get the this record and here

178
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,520
the axis for temperature is flipped so

179
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,370
the the more negative temperatures are

180
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,310
to the right and you'll see that we see

181
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,620
a high temperature exotherm or hg which

182
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,959
is non lethal and then we have a low

183
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,629
temperature exotherm which is where the

184
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,120
buds are being killed by the temperature

185
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:35,820
and here you see five Peaks from five

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,310
different buds and so we we were able to

187
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:43,140
record the temperatures where these buds

188
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:45,179
are killed this is based on a super

189
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,220
cooling ability that the buds have

190
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,370
inside of them so the water is actually

191
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,389
able to drop below it's freezing point

192
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:58,259
without without forming ice crystals

193
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:01,620
and for for you to understand what this

194
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:04,919
processes I make this videos every

195
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,950
single winter I have a ton of them to

196
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,199
show what this looks like if you just

197
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,839
look at water so you'll see that that

198
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,870
water is liquid but once you once you

199
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,170
shake it it actually crystallizes so

200
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,539
that water was super cool and then once

201
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,699
once I shook it it was actually able to

202
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,740
form the ice crystals it doesn't

203
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,420
completely freeze because there's as

204
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,039
it's freezing there's heat being

205
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:36,599
released so it's only partially becoming

206
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,399
solid so we measure this throughout the

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:45,690
winter and you'll see that this curve

208
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:48,230
has a generally sorry I'm trying to get

209
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,420
rid of that green line that was there I

210
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,690
camp so I'll just keep going so you see

211
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:58,409
that this a has a generally general

212
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,870
u-shape that follows the air temperature

213
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:02,549
which is in black so in the bottom you

214
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,820
see the cold hardiness for copper

215
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:08,789
nestled beyond and Riesling and so we

216
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,579
have what we think about as three phases

217
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:13,379
so you have an acclamation phase in

218
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:16,259
which the buds are gaining hardiness

219
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,448
early in the winter you have a

220
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,879
maintenance phase in midwinter where

221
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:22,828
they're not varying that much and then

222
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,620
in the spring they start losing their

223
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:29,338
hardiness so they are d acclimating and

224
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,129
you'll see here that there's one point

225
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,470
where the where the air temperature

226
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:37,620
actually goes below what the cold

227
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,300
hardiness is for those buds actually

228
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,828
there's two points where it gets very

229
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:45,990
close and what we see when we take those

230
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:49,739
buds from the field is that we actually

231
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,750
see damage in them so the the but

232
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,570
anatomy and vanilla is that you have

233
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,750
within a bud it's a compound but so you

234
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,360
have three smaller buds and the primary

235
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,220
is the one that has the flower so that's

236
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,060
the one that's going to give you the the

237
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,190
grapes and when we see when we see that

238
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,809
peak exotherm or

239
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,970
we see the temperature dropping below

240
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:14,069
where the cold hardiness list we see

241
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,740
this damage here where you there's a

242
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:21,600
browning in the primary bud where is the

243
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,180
secondary and tertiary are still green

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,889
in this case so they are able to the

245
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,009
plant will still be able to grow after

246
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:32,759
this damage but it won't have flowers or

247
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:34,860
great from this but at least when we

248
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:39,179
look at two separate winters we see that

249
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,009
they vary across winters and how they

250
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:44,399
gain hardiness and how they lose

251
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,230
hardness but there's about a constant in

252
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,509
the maximum hardiness that they're able

253
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,389
to get and which for a vinifera is about

254
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,490
minus 25 Celsius so if you have

255
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,830
temperatures constantly dropping below

256
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,379
that you're not going to be able to

257
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,930
cultivate vanilla grape vines which is

258
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:08,669
where the ones we get most of our wine

259
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:10,799
from so you might say it responds to

260
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:14,669
temperatures so why can't we predict

261
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:17,189
this and well we can in a way there was

262
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:20,699
a model that was developed in in

263
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,830
Washington State using field data and it

264
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,870
works very well for them but when we use

265
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,750
this model to predict our cold hardiness

266
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,330
it doesn't do a very good job so in in

267
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:35,129
green you see our data points of or

268
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:37,560
measured cold hardiness and in an orange

269
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,480
you see what the model predicted so

270
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,849
really what we see is that there's an

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,580
over prediction of hardiness in the

272
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,710
acclimation face and an over prediction

273
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:51,060
of hardiness in the d acclimation phase

274
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:52,950
and so really the acclamation face for

275
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:58,049
us is not that much of a problem but

276
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:01,320
when we look at the d acclimation here

277
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:03,149
in the in the Northeast or coldest

278
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,250
temperatures of the year are really in

279
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,399
the and the last portion of the winter

280
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,049
so if we have warm temperatures mid

281
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,569
winter and they start losing their

282
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:14,689
hardiness it's very concerning that the

283
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,040
model doesn't predict that for us

284
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,250
because of this shift and when the

285
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,809
coldest temperatures of the year are

286
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,450
here sorry the

287
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:29,699
darkus callers are later in the in the

288
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:32,070
winter and so we decided to just test

289
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,080
different temperatures to see how they

290
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,670
acclimated and just fix the rates that

291
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,370
they were given for each one of the

292
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:41,610
temperatures and it sounded like a very

293
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,889
simple idea so we took buds from from

294
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,509
the field and we made these single node

295
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,389
cuttings and we exposed them to

296
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:51,870
different temperatures two four seven

297
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:54,088
eleven and twenty-two Celsius and we

298
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,820
really expected them to gain hardiness

299
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,589
at least in the two four seven but the

300
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,629
model actually predicts that at eleven

301
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,070
it's still gaining hardness at twenty

302
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:06,830
two we didn't expect them to gain

303
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:09,420
anything when we looked at the data for

304
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:14,639
five weeks they did not gain any

305
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:16,740
hardiness in those chambers but when we

306
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,778
looked at the field they were at the

307
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,200
same time they were gaining hardiness

308
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:24,360
and so we went to see why this was

309
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,900
happening looking at the field

310
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,759
temperatures yes no they were not rooted

311
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,639
cuttings they're just the the buds and

312
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,100
single node cuttings without a reach

313
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:42,509
temperatures for five weeks yep mm-hmm

314
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:45,300
yes so when we look at the temperatures

315
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:46,919
in the field we see this and comparing

316
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,169
to the temperatures that we had in our

317
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,299
growth chambers you'll see that the blue

318
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:53,338
line which is two Celsius is really

319
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,859
close to the minimum temperatures that

320
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,690
these buds were experiencing out in the

321
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,950
field except for it really the later

322
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,750
portion here of that period and it

323
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,640
didn't so it didn't really make any

324
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,879
sense that at least in the two they

325
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,679
should be gaining some hardiness if we

326
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,149
look at the average stamp the daily

327
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,699
average temperature instead of the

328
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,980
hourly data you'll see that really for

329
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,200
most of the period it is above that two

330
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,159
Celsius and the average for the whole

331
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,470
period is actually around seven so we

332
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,879
really wanted we really expected them to

333
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,580
gain hardiness but there was something

334
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,559
to learn about this that even though

335
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,320
they were they were touching that two

336
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,579
degrees line it was going it was cycling

337
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,180
there was some temperature

338
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:43,050
amplitude going on and so really what I

339
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:46,169
did was I I try to search things related

340
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:49,649
to how temperature cycling affected

341
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:52,529
plants and I came across an entomology

342
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,959
paper that said the title was something

343
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:59,309
like Effects of neglecting temperature

344
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,470
amplitude in in insects and even though

345
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:03,059
the results were not relevant to this I

346
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,800
like the title that was the effects of

347
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,539
neglecting and this is exactly what we

348
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,949
were doing we were neglecting the

349
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,199
temperature amplitude that they

350
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:14,460
experienced in the field and just going

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,440
with constant temperatures so when we we

352
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,440
decided to expose that expose them to a

353
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,560
cycling chamber so we took buds from to

354
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,420
seven and 11 degrees Celsius and we

355
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,969
moved them into a chamber that was

356
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:31,829
cycling from 1.5 Celsius up to 12.5 so

357
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,529
that the average temperature was still

358
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,440
seven Celsius but they were they were

359
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:42,149
going very close to what the two was and

360
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,190
a little bit above what eleven was when

361
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:46,769
we looked at at these buds that were now

362
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,510
experiencing cycling temperatures we saw

363
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,509
that after we moved them into the

364
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,700
cycling they gained hardiness so really

365
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,740
they even in the two Celsius which was

366
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,020
essentially only experiencing

367
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,259
temperatures higher than what it had

368
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:04,980
seen before they did gain hardiness in

369
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:07,379
that cycling chamber so we came up with

370
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,769
a term that took into account daily

371
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,030
variations in temperature which is a

372
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:17,849
Sigma T is what we called that would

373
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:19,769
perhaps fix or model there we also did

374
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,859
I'm not going to show much of this but

375
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:26,250
we did do RNA seek with these buds and

376
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:28,079
we see a cytoskeleton reorganization is

377
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,809
up regulated and the buds that gain

378
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,689
hardiness and actually ABA was down

379
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,609
regulated which is something that is a

380
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,130
little bit counterintuitive but we have

381
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,929
a hypothesis about it and I won't have

382
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,560
time to talk about it but if you're

383
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,269
curious we can talk later and just

384
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,240
showing some results from this was last

385
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:49,619
year so this was two years ago so last

386
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,140
year we decided to

387
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:55,469
try different temperature amplitudes so

388
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,740
you'll see here that if you have the

389
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,440
bugs at 7-7 plus and minus three Celsius

390
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,750
all going from four to ten and seven

391
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,269
plus and minus five so going from two

392
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,730
all the way up to twelve you'll see that

393
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:10,558
when you have a range that is smaller it

394
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,099
doesn't it doesn't make the buds gain

395
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,619
hardiness so comparing the blue and the

396
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:19,439
orange line but when you when you give

397
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,319
it that nice ten degrees range the

398
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,798
temperature variation you actually have

399
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,298
I just realized that every time I was

400
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,778
pointing it was it wasn't actually

401
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:32,849
pointing so here the seven plus and

402
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:37,440
minus five was really where we were

403
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:39,629
seeing acclimation happening this is to

404
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,970
show some other data with two and two

405
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,830
plus and minus five you'll see that with

406
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,899
a two plus and minus five it is gaining

407
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:48,210
a lot more hardiness so the average

408
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:50,038
temperature here is still two Celsius

409
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,350
but it's gaining a lot more hardiness so

410
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,490
there is information there that we have

411
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:59,278
to adapt into the model so once we take

412
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,579
this Sigma T and we we plug it into the

413
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:04,919
model we are able to fix the earlier

414
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,439
portion of it if we use it for the whole

415
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,970
thing it doesn't work anymore so we have

416
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,519
this idea that there's different

417
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,759
responses in one phase and in the other

418
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,908
that we have to look at so looking at

419
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,640
the acclamation the same type of thing

420
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:22,590
we take buds from the field and we cut

421
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,390
them into single node cuttings and we

422
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:26,308
put them in growth chambers at different

423
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,899
temperature to see how they are

424
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:33,178
responding to to temperature this we did

425
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:34,589
at multiple times during the year so

426
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,788
when they had different chill

427
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:42,599
accumulations and you'll see here the

428
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:44,970
close that the closed dots are at the

429
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,579
lowest chill accumulation so both at 10

430
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:51,240
and at 22 degrees C they they have a

431
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:53,490
very negligible rate of D acclamation so

432
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,038
they're losing hardiness very slowly at

433
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,980
that point once you give more chilling

434
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:01,859
so the open dots 800 hours you'll see

435
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,599
that they start losing hardness slightly

436
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,869
faster and

437
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,449
when you give them 1,600 hours of

438
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:12,000
chilling that rate is much much faster

439
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,850
and you'll see that it's not a it's not

440
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,538
really a matter of where they are in

441
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:21,329
their in their initial LT because these

442
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:23,429
two time points they were at about the

443
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:28,678
same initial LTE but the rates are very

444
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:30,179
different and so if we look at how these

445
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,640
buds are responding

446
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,200
if essentially is if you take them from

447
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,590
the field at different points in time

448
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,919
they are losing their hardness faster

449
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:43,199
and faster and so when we look at how

450
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,970
this relationship is regardless of the

451
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,538
temperature so we're normalizing by

452
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:51,089
temperature and seeing from a percentage

453
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,308
percentage-wise how this what is

454
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:56,730
happening there we see this logistic

455
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:59,190
curve in the rates of D acclimation so a

456
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,860
very low chilling you have a very low

457
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,890
rate of D acclimation compared to when

458
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:07,379
you actually have accumulated chill here

459
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,730
that we called a hundred percent of the

460
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:13,650
rate of response and we call this a

461
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:16,679
potential D acclimation potential

462
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,990
because it's increasing over time until

463
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,740
you get to a hundred percent and then

464
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,659
your rate is not changing anymore so

465
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,038
going back there we see that this is

466
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:32,039
increasing and it's a logistic increase

467
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:34,679
and we created this analogy for how how

468
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,538
the response happens that is you have

469
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,538
your chillage emulation and imagine that

470
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:41,490
these buds are airplanes and so when

471
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:45,089
they have very little chill accumulation

472
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:47,490
there they're taking off so they're very

473
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:50,308
slow and then when as they're gaining

474
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,710
altitude they are increasing the speed

475
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:55,139
until they reach a cruising speed when

476
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,120
it's their maximum chilling but this

477
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,620
really depends on what temperature they

478
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,509
are experiencing and are they

479
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,058
experiencing temperatures like this in

480
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:08,158
the field so if you look at their

481
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:11,099
responses to temperature as as you add a

482
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,970
point in in your chill accumulation

483
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:17,519
you'll see that lower temperatures low

484
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,559
temperatures the acclimate

485
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,109
lower than higher temperatures so

486
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,419
essentially you have different rates of

487
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:26,399
D acclamation so basically you have

488
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,019
different types of airplanes when you

489
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,930
have when you're looking at different

490
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:33,210
temperatures and all of them are going

491
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,250
to respond in the same way to chillin if

492
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,650
you are taking off

493
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,410
you are slow regardless of what airplane

494
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,390
you are as you start gaining hype you're

495
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,190
increasing your speed and then the

496
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,190
faster airplane is going to be much

497
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,549
faster in the end but they were at very

498
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,080
similar speeds in the beginning so there

499
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,659
you go full speed depends on the

500
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,879
airplane which means that your rate of

501
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:02,930
the acclamation depends on the

502
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:06,210
temperature that you're experiencing now

503
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:09,960
when we look at these responses to

504
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,900
temperature you'll see that it appears

505
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,500
to be that you could fit a linear rate

506
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,750
in here but it would not give us the

507
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,670
full information that we want so if we

508
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,579
if we look at this process and think

509
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:26,430
about it as a biological process and we

510
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:31,439
do an Arrhenius plot which is this in

511
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:33,990
the right you'll see that there's a

512
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,809
discontinuity in the process so it's not

513
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,430
all an exponential response like it is

514
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,599
in the lower temperatures the

515
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:44,940
temperatures here are flip by the way

516
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:48,299
and so we really have to explore this

517
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,240
process creating different responses for

518
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:53,190
low and for high temperatures so what we

519
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,960
came up with is that the low

520
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,440
temperatures have an exponential

521
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,309
response and the higher temperatures

522
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,960
have a logarithmic response and combined

523
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,629
with the logistic response for the

524
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:11,750
potential for the acclamation so really

525
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,750
what we're seeing here is that you have

526
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,750
you have at the highest chill

527
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,779
accumulation you have the highest

528
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,750
potential rate of the acclamation over

529
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:24,089
there and as you decrease your chilling

530
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,650
accumulation you still have a similar

531
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:31,319
curve or a similar response but it's a

532
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:33,690
it's a lower rate at a lower

533
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,029
at a lower rate and then when you get to

534
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,000
the very low chill accumulations here

535
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:41,910
you'll see that the the rate at 22 is

536
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,299
very it's negligible compared to what it

537
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:48,570
is you're losing 0.1 degrees per day

538
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:53,279
whereas at full chilling you're up in

539
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:55,829
the 2 degrees C per day range so we take

540
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,930
this and we go back to our field cold

541
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:01,079
hardiness and what we're putting in

542
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:03,299
there is a we're integrating the effects

543
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,039
of the rate of the acclimation and the

544
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,950
chill accumulation throughout the whole

545
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,079
winter and when we plug it into the

546
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,830
model corrected with the with the lt's

547
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:16,439
there we see that we have we have fixed

548
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:20,159
this model and now we can predict much

549
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,230
better where the cold hardiness is so

550
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,570
this this was one of the objectives that

551
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,450
we had to fix this model so I think

552
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:29,369
we're very close to getting there and

553
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,190
having something that is useful for the

554
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:34,500
farmers but there's some more

555
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,289
exploration that we can get from from

556
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,650
this data so if we look at this these

557
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:43,200
are three different genotypes we're

558
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,840
looking at right Perea Riesling and

559
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,480
Cabernet Sauvignon and so in the in the

560
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:53,369
bottom you have the LTE so the hardiness

561
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:56,670
being lost over time here and on top we

562
00:25:53,369 --> 00:26:00,029
have the phenology so early bud

563
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:02,640
technology or bud break in which the

564
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:06,930
three is what we consider to be bud

565
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,480
break and so you see that these these

566
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,029
genotypes they are staggered so the ripe

567
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,700
area loses its hardiness much faster

568
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:17,430
than the other and it also breaks bud

569
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,539
faster than the other genotypes and then

570
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:23,370
you have Riesling and capsule but if we

571
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,289
take the what we learned about the rates

572
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:28,019
of the acclamation and we know the ripe

573
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:31,349
area is faster than reasoning which is

574
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:34,559
also faster than Katsav we can fix them

575
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:36,539
based on thermal time calculation for

576
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,599
this and so we see that we can actually

577
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,190
put all of them together based on this

578
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,289
thermal time it's just the fact that

579
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,019
they perceive temperatures differently

580
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:47,389
across these genotypes

581
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:50,210
but when we look at their other

582
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,160
phenology you see that reasoning and

583
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,380
capsule are now together so they are

584
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,880
breaking but at the same time with the

585
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:02,840
same thermal time but ripe area is still

586
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,510
a breaking bud faster which might not

587
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:10,339
make much sense now but I'll show you

588
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:14,359
some data later on that explains this so

589
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:16,309
I I mentioned and the dormancy and eco

590
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,309
dormancy and I showed you how the rates

591
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:21,500
of G acclamation change in that period

592
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,569
and that this is really is a

593
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,349
quantitative trait so you have a

594
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:30,079
continue it's a continuous response in

595
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:34,099
there but typically what we do is blood

596
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:36,500
brake assays to measure the the switch

597
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:39,319
from end or dormancy to eco dormancy and

598
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,420
the way that that's done is we take buds

599
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:45,919
from the field and we put them into a

600
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,950
into a chamber usually at 4 C so that

601
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,220
they four Celsius so they are

602
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:54,410
accumulating chill at a certain rate and

603
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:58,100
and then we take buds from that from

604
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:01,029
that growth chamber into 22 C and we see

605
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:03,469
how long they take to bud break and

606
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:06,440
usually the response that you see is

607
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:12,829
there's differences between insufficient

608
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:15,170
chilling and full chilling and how long

609
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:18,039
it takes for bud break to happen and how

610
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:20,900
synchronize that bud break happens and

611
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:25,460
so you can see here with insufficient

612
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:27,590
chilling that you have your very you're

613
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,750
not synchronized so some buds are

614
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:31,579
breaking well whereas others are not and

615
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:36,170
then when you get full chilling that bud

616
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:38,839
break happens very synchronously what

617
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,700
this data looks like when you look when

618
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:44,359
you put it in there in a graph is that

619
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,160
as you accumulate chill here is tying to

620
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:49,729
bud break from when you started your

621
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,040
assay at low chill accumulations it

622
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:55,700
takes a lot longer and you see that this

623
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:59,089
curve is is more it slanted so the

624
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,220
synchronicity of those buds breaking is

625
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:04,279
lower than as you then when you

626
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,200
accumulate more chilling but really

627
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:08,569
what's important here is that the time

628
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,120
difference from what is used for this

629
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:16,099
type of theta is the time to reach 50%

630
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:18,039
bud break if we look at those data there

631
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:21,139
in the graph

632
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,299
the typical exploration of this is that

633
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,320
we'll create a linear rate for those

634
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:29,869
buds for the time to bud break and

635
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,659
there's an arbitrary time that is 28

636
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:35,449
days to bud break and that's what you're

637
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:38,120
chilling accumulation is for that

638
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,420
specific genotype but when we do that

639
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:45,759
we're really ignoring curvature that you

640
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:48,350
can see in this data that is there and

641
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,629
I'll show you how that curvature is

642
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:54,139
actually similar to what we're seeing in

643
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,910
our rates of D acclimation the way I

644
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,160
actually started looking at this was

645
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:00,769
because when I looked at the bottom

646
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,440
portion of that curve that rate that is

647
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:06,769
in there is actually very close to the

648
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,720
rate of D acclimation at 4 Celsius that

649
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:11,089
we saw when we were trying to deactivate

650
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,370
them at that temperature and I will show

651
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:19,789
you how that affects your your time to

652
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:22,189
bud break I'll skip that so if up here

653
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:24,230
we have similar to the the grass that I

654
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,840
was showing you earlier we have bud

655
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:30,289
break on top and your initial LTE and

656
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,240
the bottom when you think those buds and

657
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:35,480
you put them into forcing conditions so

658
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,430
at a high temperature they you met her

659
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,470
there LTE there they have a normal

660
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,120
distribution and they're gonna lose

661
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,000
hardiness and imagine that you're

662
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,949
keeping your air there but now you're

663
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,039
looking at their air in the horizontal

664
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,830
direction so the the buds they have the

665
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,589
least hardiness are are getting to the

666
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:57,109
bud break part faster and the ones that

667
00:30:54,589 --> 00:31:00,349
are lower are getting to the bud break

668
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,509
later and so if we look at the shape of

669
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:06,409
the curve that we had before it just

670
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:07,940
changes from a probability density

671
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,080
function into a cumulative density

672
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,890
function but then you you see that

673
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,839
imagine that you have

674
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,060
chill accumulation there so you have a

675
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:21,169
slower rate and you have that more

676
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:23,179
slanted curve and you're taking you're

677
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,940
taking more time to reach but break as

678
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,400
you accumulate chisel with a lot more

679
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,880
chill accumulated in that 4c chamber

680
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,340
you'll see that the rates are faster so

681
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,950
your bud break is happening at in a

682
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:40,599
shorter period of time so you see that

683
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:43,009
that that curve is sharper there and

684
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:45,349
when we look at the time to bud break

685
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:48,710
it's the size of the bar so when you

686
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:52,279
started the the bud break sa until when

687
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,019
you saw a 50% bud break and so you see

688
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:59,589
that the time to bud break is a lot

689
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:59,589
shorter well we expect however is that

690
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:05,990
instead of having this sort of behavior

691
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:07,279
that we're measuring here is that we are

692
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,099
losing

693
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,930
we are losing hardness at 4°c as you

694
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:14,029
accumulate chillin so I imagine that you

695
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,860
took those buds from the field very

696
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:18,920
early in the winter and they have an

697
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:20,629
accumulated and chill and so as you

698
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,039
start giving them chilling they actually

699
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,210
start responding even to those

700
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,339
temperatures in which they are

701
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,950
accumulating chill so they are gonna

702
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:32,029
start losing hardiness so instead of

703
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,799
measuring your time to your time to bud

704
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,990
break as these bars that we had

705
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,359
previously because you're you're

706
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,910
starting from a different start point

707
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,919
you're actually going to have a shorter

708
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,470
time to bud break there than what you

709
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,100
actually expected it to be if you have

710
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,440
the same initial LTE and so if you

711
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,629
actually try it later on and you have

712
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,460
already maximized your rate of the

713
00:32:53,630 --> 00:33:00,170
acclimation you're still going to

714
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,690
perceive a shorter a shorter time to bud

715
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:05,930
break but that's not based on the on the

716
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,660
response of the buds to to that forcing

717
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,160
si but really how they are responding to

718
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,710
the temperature in which you're storing

719
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,790
them so if we take that into account

720
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:18,860
then we're able to separate this in

721
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:21,799
three different portions that you're

722
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:23,949
getting to with the bud break assays but

723
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:26,809
you're combining all of them together

724
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,279
one of them is your initial LT

725
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,039
so depending where you were in the

726
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,740
beginning of your of when you collected

727
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,710
your buds that gives you part of the

728
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,859
time to bud break the other portion is

729
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,470
the rates of the acclamation so how fast

730
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,079
a given genotype is that's going to give

731
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,450
you a piece of information and then the

732
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:50,779
last piece of information is really its

733
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,789
response to chilling so is it responding

734
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,829
to the that chilling accumulation when

735
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:56,299
is it maximized so that's the third

736
00:33:54,829 --> 00:34:00,169
piece of information that you actually

737
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:02,869
combine all of those into a single data

738
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:08,599
point when you when you explore them as

739
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:11,000
the time to bud break in a linear way so

740
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,539
here is just showing what we expect is

741
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,139
happening and this data sort of works

742
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:20,630
with if you see the open dots here that

743
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:24,339
are slightly lower than the than the

744
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:27,320
closed dots those had a lower a higher

745
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:31,130
initial LTE so they are the dotted line

746
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:35,570
here and the dark dots are the are the

747
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:38,450
the dashed line so if it works with the

748
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:40,399
data we still have to make a have an

749
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,859
experiment where we actually track the

750
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,809
lt''s in the beginning of the experiment

751
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,460
and the time to bud breaks so we can

752
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:48,949
really make sure of what's happening

753
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:56,630
there but this is our the hypothesis

754
00:34:48,949 --> 00:35:00,739
that we were working on now I'll skip

755
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:03,410
this we looked at gene expression of

756
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:05,829
buds losing hardiness and one of the

757
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:09,369
things that we saw was that the ABA

758
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:12,380
pathway was down regulated so they were

759
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:18,259
they were decreasing their ABA

760
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:20,720
production as they lost hardiness and so

761
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,880
we tried to use that information into

762
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:26,000
actually applying into the field so we

763
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,160
took again we took buds and we put them

764
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,380
in a growth chamber we applied ABA to

765
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,119
them we sprayed them with very high

766
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:36,110
rates compared to what you typically

767
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:38,690
have in field applications we use zero

768
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,670
ten and twenty millimolar and what we

769
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,599
saw is that in those that we have

770
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:46,730
aba they stopped losing hardiness where

771
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,990
is when you don't apply it it's still

772
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:53,210
losing hardiness and we see that also in

773
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:55,818
in the phonology you have a delayed

774
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,670
phonology when you apply ABA to the buds

775
00:35:55,818 --> 00:36:01,909
so we see that we took that information

776
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:07,730
from or RNA seek data into applying it

777
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:10,210
in the field but all of this is just

778
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:14,858
taking that information is really

779
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:18,170
exploring that LTE data to its maximum

780
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:20,269
but there was this guy who said in 1897

781
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,579
he said that the direct observation of

782
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:25,099
freezing of the freezing cell is the

783
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:27,380
best means of obtaining information on

784
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,359
the causes of death by freezing and that

785
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,220
is really because we are very visual

786
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,929
creatures we have to see what's

787
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:38,149
happening so that was so that we really

788
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:39,558
believed so we started using x-ray

789
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:42,230
phase-contrast which is a

790
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:45,619
non-destructive method to look at how

791
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:49,039
freezing was happening within the bud so

792
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:52,608
really what the what this is is that

793
00:36:49,039 --> 00:37:00,889
we're taking x-rays and we're keeping

794
00:36:52,608 --> 00:37:03,650
only the portion that is very all of the

795
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:07,548
the x-rays are not deviating from from

796
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,920
the regular horizontal path we extend

797
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:13,519
them and we we pass them through the bud

798
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,280
and those x-rays will interact with the

799
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:20,539
densities with the different densities

800
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,640
in the bud and as they go by you'll see

801
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:25,250
that some of them are going to interact

802
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,558
they they chase or pass slightly and

803
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,318
because of that interaction you actually

804
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,900
have a signal in an image so you get

805
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:35,179
your get your x-rays there this is

806
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,420
different from what absorption x-ray is

807
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:40,818
when when you break a bone because the

808
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:44,030
the variations in density are very

809
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:47,469
slight here in the green tissue so we're

810
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:49,849
not able to use the absorption x-ray and

811
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:53,389
we're also doing this while we were

812
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:54,619
freezing the buds and I'll stand

813
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:59,058
rotating them

814
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:02,269
so we are we are doing a CT scan of buds

815
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:11,210
at the synchrotron and this is just to

816
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:13,459
show you what it looks like so this is a

817
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,039
this is a butt of ripe area that word

818
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,228
slowly slicing through it so this is

819
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,089
after the reconstruction that's what it

820
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:23,989
looked like you're seeing the xylem

821
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:25,849
vessels here in the stem portion and I

822
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:27,769
think you might remember I mentioned the

823
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:30,019
bud cushion you see that there's no

824
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:31,788
vascular ization here in the base of the

825
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:34,159
bud so it's not really connected to the

826
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:36,559
xylem and that's what gives it the

827
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,940
ability to supercool the fact that it's

828
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,979
separated from the king so that's what

829
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:47,048
the what the images looked like and we

830
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:47,048
can we can look at them afterwards

831
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:55,068
so also incorporated in this is we use

832
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,469
needle thermocouples they have a tiny

833
00:38:55,068 --> 00:39:00,739
thermocouple in the tip of that needle

834
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:03,170
that measures the temperature and we're

835
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:05,389
able to stick those inside the inside

836
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,559
the button and this is this is what they

837
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:12,078
look like they're very tiny and this is

838
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,298
just comparing in the field what it

839
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,009
looks like so you see that the the bud

840
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:22,429
temperatures sometimes it's different

841
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:25,278
than the air temperature now I'm showing

842
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:26,598
you this video and I'm actually going to

843
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:29,059
scroll through it because you're gonna

844
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:32,869
see the the bud this is a bud of a mere

845
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:35,150
incest as it's freezing and what we see

846
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:36,890
is really an expansion of the tissue so

847
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,809
I'll go back and forth and you'll see

848
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:41,900
that it looks like it's it's breathing

849
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:44,539
and from there we can identify that the

850
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,599
base of the bud is where the where the

851
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:49,789
freezing actually starts and then it

852
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,219
propagates throughout the whole bud and

853
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:55,880
you see the the the top portions of the

854
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:57,979
but is only freezing much later on the

855
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,160
whole process of freezing actually

856
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:03,018
happens through a time span of three

857
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:05,268
minutes in this case and we were

858
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:08,329
lowering the temperature at 50 degrees

859
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:11,839
Celsius per hour so it was a very steep

860
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:13,460
rate and it was still freezing only it

861
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:25,280
was still taking three minutes for it to

862
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:27,470
fully freeze so after we reconstruct

863
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,050
these buds were able to see what they

864
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:32,719
look like from the inside and then

865
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,210
you'll see this is ripe area and you see

866
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,419
that the bud is really expanding there

867
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,829
and one thing to notice if you remember

868
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,039
that ripe area had a different

869
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:45,559
technology compared to the vanilla's you

870
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,619
see here that they six you already have

871
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:50,809
these scales separated so you're already

872
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:53,059
at a different state you're this is

873
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:55,549
stage 1 this is stage 2 and this is what

874
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:58,639
we call stage 3 and you'll see that the

875
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:01,400
inflorescences is expanding very quickly

876
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,469
throughout that time because this is a

877
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,500
non-destructive method we're able to

878
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:08,449
actually measure the freezing all these

879
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,929
specific buds with those needle

880
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:14,960
thermocouples and so we see that that

881
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:19,069
bud at day 0 was freezing at minus 22

882
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:22,340
Celsius then at day 6 that bud was

883
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:27,289
freezing at minus 15 Celsius and at day

884
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:30,800
13 that bud that was already very large

885
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:33,139
was freezing at about minus 8 Celsius so

886
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,510
you see the hardiness being lost and

887
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:40,190
we're able to actually measure from the

888
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:43,580
specific buds that we're imaging in

889
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,889
vanilla here looking at they 0 and day

890
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:49,940
13 so the extremes that I showed you for

891
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:52,730
a ripe area you'll see the vanilla is

892
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,099
still closed at day 13 even though it's

893
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,280
lost all of its hardiness it's still a

894
00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:00,739
close bud you can see that it it's

895
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,410
swollen it's a little bit larger but we

896
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:06,109
don't perceive it yet as being a stage 2

897
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:08,809
so it's phenology is delayed compared to

898
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,820
that of ripe area and that's largely

899
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:14,559
because of the difference in growth

900
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:17,420
within those between those species

901
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,639
vanilla is actually expanding the base a

902
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,099
lot more than it's in fluorescence so

903
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,528
the inflorescences are so small

904
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,769
even and it already lost all of its

905
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:30,048
hardness as compared to in ripe area

906
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:34,909
where we're seeing that really large in

907
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:39,228
fluorescent mus is a different wild

908
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:42,739
species is very interesting in in its

909
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:45,108
structure because even at bay zero you

910
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:45,710
see that there's a lot of tissue in

911
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:47,748
there

912
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,489
so it's all green tissue it doesn't have

913
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:52,639
all that airspace that we were seeing

914
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:55,249
compared to the other species so here is

915
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,828
looking at day 0 from those 3 species

916
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:59,899
and you'll see that mu ences is really

917
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:01,880
full of green tissue there's no air

918
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,130
pockets in it whereas the other species

919
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,420
have their pockets they also have very

920
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:12,680
different sizes these are to scale these

921
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:17,119
images so it was it was interesting to

922
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:19,159
see that that was the this was the bud

923
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,349
that was freezing in that in the first

924
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,538
video so you can see the different

925
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,729
portions of it expanding so now we were

926
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:28,369
able to take that information to study

927
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:30,228
specific tissues of the bud and actually

928
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:32,479
learn what is happening and those

929
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:37,278
tissues that it's failing for it's cold

930
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:38,989
hardiness so some of the conclusions

931
00:43:37,278 --> 00:43:41,329
that we take from from the data that I

932
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:43,639
showed you is that acclamation and D

933
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:45,559
acclamation portions they respond

934
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,379
differently to the temperature stimulus

935
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,089
and really is the acclamation is

936
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,440
responding both to the absolute

937
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:53,838
temperature that the buds are

938
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,298
experiencing and the amplitude of that

939
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:58,728
temperature whereas the the D

940
00:43:56,298 --> 00:44:01,670
acclamation is really only responding to

941
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:03,318
the through the absolute temperature but

942
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:07,940
that's not a linear response as

943
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:09,858
typically is used with those data the

944
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,809
dormancy transition is a quantitative

945
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:15,440
trait and this is very helpful for us

946
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:18,079
because now we can explore it better and

947
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,539
we can separate those three traits that

948
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,028
are associated with this with the

949
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:25,039
dormancy studies and so there's

950
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:27,498
information that we get from the bud

951
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:30,349
break data that perhaps we won't

952
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:32,808
necessarily see if we just use the rates

953
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:35,329
of the acclamation so perhaps combining

954
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:36,410
those two is a necessary step that we

955
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:38,960
need to really

956
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:41,868
and what is the dormancy and how is

957
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:47,000
chilling being accumulated in the buds

958
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:49,099
and here the acclamation is partially

959
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,559
growth and I put that partially in there

960
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:54,200
because we see especially in the field

961
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,509
we see react LeMay ssin so if they

962
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:58,368
experience warm temperatures and then

963
00:44:56,509 --> 00:45:00,528
the temperature lowers again they'll

964
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:04,250
gain a little bit of hardiness so it is

965
00:45:00,528 --> 00:45:06,318
a slightly reversible process and if it

966
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,659
was only growth we know that the

967
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:11,268
definition of growth tells us that it is

968
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:13,670
an irreversible process so the loss of

969
00:45:11,268 --> 00:45:16,338
hardiness can't be only growth because

970
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,980
otherwise it wouldn't we wouldn't see

971
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:21,170
that reversibility and potentially

972
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:24,500
because it is partially growth is that

973
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,750
when we use ABA we're we're able to stop

974
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,849
that growth from happening and then we

975
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,000
prevent that loss of hardiness so this

976
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:34,759
is where the application in the field is

977
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,909
we might be able to in the future

978
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:40,338
apply ABA and prevent damage in the

979
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:44,899
later winter if they if they don't lose

980
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:47,150
their hardiness so with that I want to

981
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,450
thank all the people that helped me with

982
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:53,389
with collecting data especially dr.

983
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:57,259
thorn from my committee and Ken at the

984
00:45:53,389 --> 00:46:01,940
chess who is the one that pushed me into

985
00:45:57,259 --> 00:46:04,579
getting those images and really special

986
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:08,358
thanks for for the lab group the rice

987
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:11,720
group and Jason the Jason was the one

988
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:14,000
who said every time I came up with a

989
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:16,098
good idea with a not a good idea with an

990
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,380
idea he would say yeah we should try

991
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:21,380
that and then Bruce was the one who put

992
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,079
the steps on the break and said about

993
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,150
this time last year he was like maybe

994
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,009
you shouldn't be sitting on this

995
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,838
mountain of data as you should start

996
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:30,730
working on and towards finishing your

997
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:32,989
degree

998
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,298
thanks for them for working together

999
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:37,848
into something that I guess work and

1000
00:46:35,298 --> 00:46:41,559
thank you for listening to me and I can

1001
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:41,559
take questions that you may have

1002
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:51,639
okay thank you when economically

1003
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:56,489
feasible do you think it would be to

1004
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:59,170
spray ABA on on an orchard alright I

1005
00:46:56,489 --> 00:47:01,419
guess Geneva can usually cure the

1006
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:03,400
question but the question was how

1007
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,970
practical and feasible would it be to

1008
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:10,329
apply ABA through the orchard so that's

1009
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:14,049
a very good question it is a very

1010
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:15,880
expensive product right now and the

1011
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,840
concentrations that we were using were

1012
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,730
very high

1013
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,710
but if you think about the amount of

1014
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:24,099
wood that is going to be left in your

1015
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:26,320
vineyard and that is very small the

1016
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:29,500
volume that you would be applying if it

1017
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,019
was directed would be very very small of

1018
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,210
course with that comes a lot of a lot of

1019
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:37,119
problems like the ABA is actually a

1020
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:40,750
photosensitive molecule the s ABA that

1021
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,849
is used and so I'm trying it right now

1022
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,119
in the field to see if it actually works

1023
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:48,639
with just spraying them because it just

1024
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,460
it might get degraded before it can have

1025
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:54,190
an effect on the buds so I think now

1026
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,470
that we understand that ABA can have an

1027
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:59,110
effect and that we can use it then we

1028
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:02,519
start exploring how applicable it is to

1029
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:05,500
use it in the field but it's coming to a

1030
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:10,829
we have an idea of how to mitigate the

1031
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,829
damage not just know that damage happen

1032
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:21,609
yes I exchange an email about the micro

1033
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:26,079
molecular mechanisms of cold acclamation

1034
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:28,390
and these late embryo Genesis proteins

1035
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,960
that that are intrinsically disordered

1036
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:33,279
how they might act us as credit

1037
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,980
protectants if you give it any more

1038
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,090
thought to that or in general it's the

1039
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:42,219
molecular mechanisms by which you're

1040
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:45,100
becoming cold-hearty okay so the

1041
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:46,899
question is if I had if I have given any

1042
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:51,519
thought to the molecular mechanisms of

1043
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:55,019
acclamation I as I mentioned before we

1044
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,019
have a data set for

1045
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,619
RNA seek on what has changed in what

1046
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,818
genes are being differentially expressed

1047
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:07,579
I haven't really analyzed it fully to

1048
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:09,769
see what's happening as I I mentioned

1049
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:11,510
there's a reorganization of the

1050
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:14,630
cytoskeleton which is something that

1051
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:20,510
that happens that has been seen in other

1052
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:24,230
plants and there's also a low

1053
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:26,510
temperature correlated protein that I

1054
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:29,389
remember EC that is a gibberellin

1055
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:32,809
related we also plant hormones playing a

1056
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:34,818
role but from from the cytoskeleton side

1057
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:36,980
it's interesting that they are changing

1058
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:39,289
their structure the structures of the

1059
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,900
cells from the physical standpoint

1060
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:44,690
because they are able to resist a very

1061
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,970
low temperature and maintaining that

1062
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:50,450
water in the liquid state in an

1063
00:49:46,969 --> 00:49:53,598
interface with ice they are actually

1064
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:58,279
lowering their water potential to a very

1065
00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:02,720
negative state so they're withstanding -

1066
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,390
250 bars or something close to that in

1067
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,848
those cells which is something that

1068
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:10,039
doesn't typically happen except for in

1069
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:12,890
the winter so you see that there's a

1070
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:16,009
need for structural reconfiguration of

1071
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:20,088
the cells but yet more more than that

1072
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:24,140
now yeah we haven't seen and we actually

1073
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:26,269
expect that a lot of it is a response to

1074
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:29,358
dehydration because those buds actually

1075
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:33,108
lose water in a way throughout the

1076
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:34,789
earlier portions of the winter interest

1077
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:40,608
we look to see how many of the operate

1078
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:55,759
up regulated proteins or the structure

1079
00:50:40,608 --> 00:51:02,960
of the proteins one more what did you

1080
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:04,579
say to Bruce so the question is now with

1081
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,608
this information how do we apply this

1082
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:09,619
into a breeding program I think one of

1083
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:12,230
the the best pieces of him from

1084
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:14,390
that we can take from this is that split

1085
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:17,358
from the bud break a say that we're

1086
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:19,879
usually looking for things that require

1087
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:23,328
more chilling so that they break but

1088
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:28,009
later and they're not damaged by laya by

1089
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:31,640
late Frost's and really we can now split

1090
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:34,690
it into what has the lowest LTE what has

1091
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:37,489
a low D acclamation rate and what has a

1092
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:39,980
higher chilling requirement so we can

1093
00:51:37,489 --> 00:51:43,098
really maximize that whole process just

1094
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,349
to have the the plants coming out later

1095
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:48,619
in the in the spring so that they don't

1096
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:52,249
suffer any damage from late late for us

1097
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:54,499
and really late winter dips and

1098
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:57,078
temperature after they have they would

1099
00:51:54,498 --> 00:52:00,469
expect to have the act muted so I think

1100
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,480
really what I gave him what I expected

1101
00:52:00,469 --> 00:52:04,759
to give him were markers what I gave him

1102
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,150
was now a phenotype so that he can go

1103
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:14,389
after the markers thank you so much

1104
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:17,989
thank you this has been a production of
