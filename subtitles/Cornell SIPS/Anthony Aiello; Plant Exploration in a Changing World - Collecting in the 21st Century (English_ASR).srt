1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,000
all right Thank You Don is it's really a

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,888
pleasure to be here and as Don said I

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,750
was an undergraduate here and at the

6
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:21,500
opposite end of this hallway work

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,839
mounting herbarium specimens back in my

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,539
senior year is one of my jobs one of the

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,129
better jobs I had here is undergrad so

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,279
it's it's really nice to be back in this

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:33,259
building and relive memories of this

12
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,988
building so I have a lot to cover today

13
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:39,170
probably more than I I can cover but

14
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:42,709
we'll see how far we get today so what I

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,670
primarily want to talk about is so what

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,739
I want to talk about is the role of

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,489
Botanic Gardens that you may not think

18
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:53,238
of in terms of plant exploration and

19
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:55,579
plant introduction and so and give you a

20
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,349
the briefest of histories of the Morris

21
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,420
Arboretum but then get into some of the

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,728
work that I've done I'm really focusing

23
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,500
on China we do some collecting in the

24
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,868
United States as well and I'll if I have

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,118
time we'll finish with that but mainly

26
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:09,950
focus on China because it's exotic and

27
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:14,269
they're good stories about traveling in

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,299
China so all right

29
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:19,728
the Morris Arboretum was a was formerly

30
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:23,539
an estate John and Lydia Morris who were

31
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:25,399
siblings moved there in 1887 set up

32
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,810
their family estate or their country

33
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,909
home there and that's shown on the left

34
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,100
of this slide as you can see it was very

35
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,009
open at the time this was sort of out in

36
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,169
the country and this really was a

37
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,909
self-sustaining country estate they were

38
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,618
very interested in all sorts of things

39
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:44,118
they were interested in antiques plants

40
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:45,978
artwork and they collected plants as

41
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,200
well as lots of other things and this

42
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:51,340
shows the Rose Garden and the

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,379
conservatories back in the early 1930s

44
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,170
so since then the Arboretum has evolved

45
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,519
we are still a collection and we really

46
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,429
think of ourselves as the collections

47
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,078
based botanic garden but we embellish

48
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:06,530
the garden embellish the collections

49
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:09,019
with ornamentals so we're well known for

50
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,060
our rose garden is one of the things our

51
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,310
historic collection of trees and

52
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,080
philadelphia has a pretty ideal climate

53
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,670
it's sort of a sweet spot in terms of

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,980
growing trees and so some of the things

55
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:22,109
our big Katsura are the biggest of their

56
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,810
kind and certainly in eastern North

57
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,600
America as Dunn said we have a great

58
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,409
witch hazel collection one of my

59
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,479
interests

60
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,879
Magnolia's is something we've had a

61
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,939
long-standing interest in and then

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,949
maples as well and so all these are some

63
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,319
of the primary focuses but we have other

64
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,569
things we we grow as well so I'll give

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,090
you a 30 second you know plant

66
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,439
exploration history and a lot of people

67
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,090
think of the Golden Age of plant

68
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,520
exploration as the early nineteen

69
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,830
hundred's when people like eh Wilson

70
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,380
were collecting for first for Beach

71
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,040
nurseries in England and then for the

72
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,319
Arnold Arboretum in Boston and Wilson is

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,650
famous for lots of things including the

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,659
dove tree Davidian value krodha but

75
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,500
Wilson also had a strong horticultural

76
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,780
interest and later in his after he broke

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,819
his leg in China he was he travelled to

78
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,699
Japan which even then was you know

79
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,169
travel was a little easier in Japan

80
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:21,269
collected a lot of azalea Solo the

81
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,699
Kurumi azalea's the first introductions

82
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,170
were through Wilson and he was also

83
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,789
interested in flowering cherries which

84
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,649
is something that I think is long

85
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,239
forgotten about eh Wilson

86
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,180
and one of my great interests are

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,870
flowering cherries as well and so so

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,819
that's the early 1900s through World War

89
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,969
two China was still open to Westerners

90
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:45,090
so things like medicine Oya were able to

91
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,949
come out of China as it were this is our

92
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,900
big medicine oil grove at the Morris

93
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,359
Arboretum I should say we're four hours

94
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,019
pretty much due south of here so it's

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,150
not that hard to get to Philadelphia but

96
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,010
this is a probably a full zone warmer so

97
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,569
it feels like Nina always brings her

98
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,548
class down in April and they feel like

99
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:04,829
they've arrived in the tropics when they

100
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:10,080
come down there so please come down and

101
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:13,019
visit us so you know why do we go plant

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,880
exploring here's some of the reasons and

103
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,519
I won't read through these but I'll try

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,759
and touch on not all of these but many

105
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,069
of these today in my talk so back in the

106
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,629
late 70s the Arboretum identified

107
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:27,000
regions around the world that we would

108
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,709
target for plant exploration and some of

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,189
these seem obvious the eastern United

110
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,680
States

111
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,959
central China going up in

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,120
to Manchuria or northeastern China the

113
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,399
Korean Peninsula northern Japan what

114
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,829
what might be less obvious are the

115
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,839
Balkans and Asia Minor areas that have

116
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:45,060
similar climates to Philadelphia and

117
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,989
that yield you know plants a good

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,870
ornamental interest for us so those were

119
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,389
our goals in the late 70s here's where

120
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,160
we've gone since then in terms of plant

121
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,930
exploration trips and it's better seen

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,050
graphically on this slide and you can

123
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,168
see in purple are the target areas and

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,270
then the pins represent where we've gone

125
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:08,370
since then so we've really you know over

126
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:10,049
the last it's almost 30 years now really

127
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,189
set some goals and being able to

128
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,598
systematically achieve those goals so I

129
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:18,120
like to start out this talk with talking

130
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,740
about invasiveness because when I first

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,168
started giving this talk that was always

132
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,970
the first question that people ask do

133
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,978
you want to bring back invasives and of

134
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,780
course the answer is no so I start with

135
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,168
this and hopefully we'll you know dispel

136
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:34,459
that question so perhaps the sort of the

137
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:37,649
greatest example or a great example of

138
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:39,180
invasives that were planted with all you

139
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:41,429
know with great ideas and great

140
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,300
intentions is calorie pair or Pyrus

141
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:48,689
calorie ahna planted and promoted widely

142
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,310
in the you know in China in 1960s this

143
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,439
is one of the original plantings of

144
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,879
Bradford pear the scissors original

145
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,569
planting of Bradford pear in College

146
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,139
Park Maryland from the 1960s you know

147
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:02,490
great great tree look looks really good

148
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,460
here they are today and they've really

149
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,110
done well they were pruned well at the

150
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,120
beginning and they've held up really

151
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,509
well other than the powerlines on the

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,819
left and but we all know the problems

153
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:17,430
with calorie pare one is the weak

154
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,889
crotches and them splitting but I think

155
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,050
more importance from an ecological point

156
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,220
of view is the invasiveness and what's

157
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,439
happened is originally there was

158
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,409
basically one clone planted which is

159
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,668
self infertile subsequently additional

160
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:32,759
clones were planted so there's

161
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:34,168
outcrossing and fruit production so we

162
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,788
have one of these unfortunately in front

163
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:37,740
of our house my section my neighbor's

164
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:39,209
tree and those little fruits it's not

165
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,250
only are they annoying but they stain

166
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:45,120
the paint on your car which is doubly

167
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,360
annoying so if you were to drive a 90

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,040
five from Philadelphia to Washington

169
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,689
when the Yoshino cherries were in flower

170
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,819
this is what you would see and these are

171
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,490
not Yoshino cherries these are calorie

172
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,519
pairs and basically once you hit

173
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,949
Baltimore and from Baltimore to probably

174
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:06,089
at least Richmond this is what I 95

175
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,620
looks like the first third of April and

176
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,119
certainly we don't want to recreate this

177
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,030
we want them oh boy this wherever we can

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,850
so as plant explorers as Botanic Gardens

179
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:16,138
I think one of our roles is to evaluate

180
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,490
invasives and so I don't shy away from

181
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,879
it I think that's something we need to

182
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,939
embrace and think about and take on as a

183
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,439
role of Botanic Gardens so a little more

184
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,459
exciting than that is looking at

185
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,379
hardiness and vigor so you may think of

186
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,448
Philadelphia as being the banana Belt

187
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,819
but we really cannot grow camellias that

188
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,220
reliably in Philadelphia there were some

189
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,469
cold winters in the early 80s that wiped

190
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,970
out most of the collections of camellias

191
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,760
in Philadelphia and certainly in

192
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,280
Washington DC and from that arose a

193
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,159
program at the National Arboretum mainly

194
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,799
to do camellia breeding for hardiness

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,590
and you think of the camellia Belt

196
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,870
basically as Norfolk Virginia going down

197
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:00,329
the coast on the Gulf Coast and then

198
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,310
California up into the Pacific Northwest

199
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,240
so we're above what might be called the

200
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,490
camellia Belle

201
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,038
well with this in mind in the mid-80s

202
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,660
our director and some colleagues from

203
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,788
the National Arboretum and Longwood

204
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,669
Gardens went to a couple islands off the

205
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:17,009
coast of Korea these islands are above

206
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:19,589
the 38th parallel so it was politically

207
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,050
sensitive to go there and it's the

208
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:24,329
northernmost populations of camellia

209
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,490
japonica or the common camellia and here

210
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:28,948
are camellia japonica is growing on

211
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,780
those islands you can see you may be

212
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,580
able to see on the lower left there's a

213
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:37,110
person standing there so these get to be

214
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,408
small trees and they collected a large

215
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,870
number of seed from three islands there

216
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:44,580
these are single red flowered

217
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,860
communities not the highly ornamental

218
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,500
camellias but the the purpose of this

219
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:54,990
was to look for extending hardiness in

220
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:57,389
zone six so we planted out about 750 of

221
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,990
these starting in the late 80s after a

222
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,028
couple of winners this is

223
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,860
what they looked like and then from

224
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:06,659
those we called those and they're down

225
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,970
to about 50 plants from those original

226
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,730
750 those are now planted throughout the

227
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,320
Arboretum we subsequently did

228
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,230
evaluations of those and made four

229
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,510
selections from our plants one of which

230
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,110
is here on campus in the aisle our aisle

231
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:25,330
our quad so there is you know there was

232
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,980
shown to be extra hardiness in these and

233
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,649
so this is if you think about it the

234
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,778
selections were made around 2010 plants

235
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,730
were collected in 84 so this is a

236
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:36,039
generation of work and one of the

237
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,870
beauties of where I work and I think of

238
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,419
Botanic Gardens in general is you have

239
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,320
that long term horizon you're able to do

240
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:46,899
projects that take a whole generation -

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:51,160
so as I said nice glossy leaves single

242
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:53,458
red flowers and here are not just our

243
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,319
selections ours are the bottom for

244
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:58,359
balustrade Bloomfield Meadowbrook and

245
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,028
Morris Mercury and others that came out

246
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,050
of Longwood Gardens and then another

247
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:05,950
Korean fire from a private individual so

248
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,469
again this was a really targeted

249
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,149
collection that did result in improved

250
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,950
hardiness and these are now commercially

251
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,190
available so you could you can buy these

252
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:19,089
from a few mail-order nurseries so

253
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:22,000
starting in the early 90s our shift our

254
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:25,329
focus shifted to collecting in China as

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,610
you can see here so the 80s really there

256
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:30,219
was focus on Korea politically things

257
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,019
got easier and so China opened up and

258
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,990
we've really gone on a large number of

259
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:37,328
trips to China since then we haven't

260
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,820
done this alone we partner as Don say

261
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:41,500
the partnership called knack peck and

262
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,550
it's been a really great we call it a

263
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,958
consortium because no bylaws there's no

264
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:49,179
administration it's just a group of

265
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,359
gardens that are committed to this I've

266
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:53,919
been working together for 25 years to

267
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,639
collect and work with partners in China

268
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,229
so it's been a really great effort so if

269
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,049
you think about China in the United

270
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,778
States they are about the same land mass

271
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:06,879
roughly large parts of China are have

272
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:08,620
very similar climates to the United

273
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,370
States so there are a lot of areas that

274
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,850
are easy targets in terms of finding

275
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,860
climatic analog

276
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,000
that work in whether it's southeastern

277
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,459
Pennsylvania or Boston or Chicago so

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,528
what we've really targeted are a set of

279
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,939
mountains in central town China the

280
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:27,429
Qinling mountains which is the

281
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,949
continental divide between the Yangtze

282
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:33,879
River to the north and the Yellow River

283
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:35,500
to the south and sorry other way around

284
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,620
Yellow River to the north Yangtze River

285
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,409
to the south and collecting around the

286
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,810
city of Xi'an which is the term one of

287
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,730
the terminus of the Silk Road a very

288
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,528
ancient capital of China and where the

289
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,399
you may know for the terracotta soldiers

290
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:53,588
and so that area has very similar

291
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,958
climate and great plant diversity so

292
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,670
we've really as you can see targeted the

293
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,088
Qinling mountains both you know from

294
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:04,149
from east to west so what's it mean to

295
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:06,190
go to China we have partners and often

296
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:08,139
will land in Beijing and spend a couple

297
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,199
of days just getting acclimated it's a

298
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:13,360
12 or 14 hour flight from Chicago to

299
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:15,189
Beijing so you'd need a little time to

300
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,769
recover from jetlag do a little

301
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,170
sightseeing in some of the you know some

302
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,500
of the historic sites in Beijing do a

303
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:25,778
little horticultural browsing and or

304
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,299
looking at some of the places this is

305
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:32,438
pinus bonne Gena at one of the Royal

306
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:33,729
Palaces in Beijing and then you know go

307
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:36,549
the Great Wall you're sort of the

308
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,740
touristy things in recent years we've

309
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,179
transited to Xi'an because it's closer

310
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,250
to where we're going Xi'an is a

311
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:45,129
fascinating place it's really a melting

312
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,399
pot of cultures it's a strong Muslim

313
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:50,470
influence there and so it's a very

314
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,958
culturally interesting place in China

315
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,209
it's one of the two cities with a with

316
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,068
the remaining wall in China the most

317
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,539
cities in China have the walls city

318
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:01,179
walls they were torn down during the

319
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:04,629
Cultural Revolution but the one in Xi'an

320
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:06,758
was maintained so the interesting

321
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:09,778
juxtaposition between the modern and the

322
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:13,688
ancient when you visit a place like this

323
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:15,970
so from there we then head out and start

324
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:19,750
to do our collecting in targeted areas

325
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:22,509
and as I said we owe and last year I was

326
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,039
there in southern Szechuan and visited

327
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,429
kind of again at the beginning of the

328
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,219
trip visited a place that

329
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,439
it's basically the yellow zone of China

330
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,050
long-long Nature Preserve which has

331
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,130
these very interesting travertine pools

332
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:39,059
a really remarkable place to visit I

333
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:41,659
traveled the last several years with

334
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,469
another Cornell grad Michael dose Minh

335
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:46,110
Michael and I have these sort of

336
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:49,440
strangely parallel lives that have

337
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,259
intersected at many points and so we've

338
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,540
been great friends since the mid 90s and

339
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:59,009
have traveled in China and are still

340
00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:01,110
friends so Testament something and so

341
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:02,580
this is again this was last year which

342
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,740
I'll get back to in a minute but a

343
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,450
wonderful place and it's nice to have at

344
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,490
least a day or so to acclimate and just

345
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,970
do a little tourism before you get out

346
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,759
into the field and doing your collecting

347
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,920
so as I said partnerships are really key

348
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,629
for the last 10 years or so we've worked

349
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,269
with the Beijing Botanic Garden on the

350
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:22,830
right is Kong Wong who works at the

351
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,528
Beijing Botanic Garden has really been

352
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,990
our entree into China and really has

353
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:30,778
sort of makes it all happen when we're

354
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,240
there but we also then partner with

355
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:36,629
local botanists in 2005 we worked with

356
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:40,440
Professor Sun from the lando Botanic

357
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,689
Garden in Gansu Province of Gansu this

358
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,870
past year we worked with the folks at

359
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,240
the long long research station so it's

360
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,399
always good to have a local botanist

361
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,500
this is the someone from Chengdu

362
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,860
Institute of botany and Sichuan who was

363
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,350
with us last year so we'll start out

364
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,610
sort of that we'll set up base and try

365
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,500
and stay there for three or four days

366
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,259
and then radiate out from there so we're

367
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,970
not travelling too much and sometimes

368
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,909
you drive through countryside that looks

369
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,310
like this and you know there doesn't

370
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,480
seem to be a natural plant as far as the

371
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,189
eye can see and you sort of when they're

372
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,870
aware we're something that you know

373
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,390
we're targeted in terms of collecting

374
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,830
and it's this size a couple years old

375
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,659
but you still see this just this

376
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,759
terrorist agriculture it's pretty

377
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,889
remarkable and you really can't get any

378
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,330
machines up there so in some ways it's

379
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,509
like traveling back in time when you

380
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,430
visit these very rural places eventually

381
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,559
you hit the end of the road and then

382
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:38,909
start hiking up and doing your

383
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,379
collecting so and you know we try and

384
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:42,059
find these forest cuts where

385
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,439
the seed is actually lower on the plants

386
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,009
we might be able to reach the seed on

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,840
the plants so one of the things as I

388
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,029
said that we've been trying to do is

389
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,280
looking at species conservation and

390
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,919
using Botanic Gardens as a model for

391
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,740
species conservation one in terms of

392
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,689
capturing enough diversity that you can

393
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,250
actually do some conservation in the

394
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:06,420
garden but then also using collecting

395
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,519
unusual and rare species as

396
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:11,149
demonstrations and educational

397
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,269
opportunities so we've been focusing on

398
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:14,100
maples

399
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:17,009
as one of our groups and we're part of

400
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,690
the a PGA's plant collections and

401
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,129
network along with Cornell Botanic

402
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:24,690
Gardens where one of the multi-site

403
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:26,610
holders of of maples so the last few

404
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,000
years this has been one of my great

405
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,889
interests and building our collection

406
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,600
we've collected things that look you

407
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,789
know you think of as maples this is Acer

408
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,159
singling ants looks a lot like a sugar

409
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:40,889
maple then things that don't really look

410
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,409
very maple like that yellow shrubby

411
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:46,230
plant in the mid ground is Acer stack

412
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:49,019
via filum which is a high elevation

413
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,539
Chinese species doesn't look very maple

414
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,529
like it's actually related to a suspect

415
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:56,909
aadum if you know that native species

416
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:59,610
another one is a syrup Ekta nate 'm

417
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:01,589
again you know looks somewhat maple like

418
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,110
but kind of stretches what you think of

419
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:07,710
as a typical maple I mean certainly it's

420
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,419
Samaras give it off here and then a

421
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,130
recent collection is something that

422
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,590
hadn't been in the United States Acer

423
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,110
try caudatum which is related to a soar

424
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,029
plant no DS plant that wasn't in

425
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,919
cultivation in the US and really I think

426
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:23,399
it's it's best used as a teaching tool

427
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,700
to talk about plant diversity a very

428
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,900
interesting and beautiful plant and then

429
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,259
something you know sometimes you come

430
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,810
across things that are familiar but

431
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,549
perhaps in their native setting don't

432
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:37,319
seem that familiar so this is a plant

433
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,019
that I've seen not all over but seem

434
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:47,309
relatively calmly here on campus and we

435
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:49,589
know what this is dan no this is ASA

436
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:51,990
grizzly I'm growing in the wild which

437
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:54,409
you may not think of but you know there

438
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,980
it is growing out

439
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,150
basically out of a rock face here pretty

440
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,259
remarkable

441
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,700
so about 2010 this publication came out

442
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,250
the read list of maples and what's on

443
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,410
the cover a cigar is iam so this was an

444
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,869
epiphany for me I realized at this point

445
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,240
that a sub regime is an endangered

446
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:16,099
species in China it's a I wouldn't say

447
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,109
common but it's a well-loved garden

448
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:20,329
plant it's it's really a wonderful

449
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:22,849
garden plant but in its native habitat

450
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:25,669
is endangered mostly through habitat

451
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:28,099
fragmentation and reproduction

452
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:31,759
reproductive barriers so we started a

453
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:34,490
project to look at how much genetic

454
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,019
diversity is in kolja Batian and whether

455
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,970
or not that captures the genetic

456
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:40,129
diversity of plants in the wild or

457
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,289
whether further conservation efforts

458
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,580
need to be made so essentially how many

459
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,159
pandas how many eighths are grisly

460
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,019
misleading in captivity to capture the

461
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,730
genetic diversity of the wild if the

462
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:51,769
path the pandas or the a surgeries and

463
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,160
where to go extinct so here's the native

464
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:56,389
range of paper bark maple and this is if

465
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,100
you don't know this plant it's a

466
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,130
wonderful garden plant it has this great

467
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,779
exfoliating bark fabulous fall color and

468
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,430
the plant of many many interests

469
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:07,279
throughout the year really one of my

470
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,440
favorite garden plants the known

471
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,480
collections the United States only come

472
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,480
from a relatively restricted part of the

473
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,339
range so this kind of in free enforced

474
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,559
our hypothesis that perhaps what's in

475
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:21,619
Kola Batian is just a fragment or a

476
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,619
segment of the greater diversity so what

477
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,769
we decided to do starting in 2013 was to

478
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:30,769
sample known wild collected plants in

479
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:33,379
the United States at these locations and

480
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:35,299
then folks at the Morton Arboretum start

481
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,070
we're doing the molecular analysis of

482
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,200
these and so if there's any luckier

483
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:41,509
biologists in here I'm gonna have to

484
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,269
pass on the questions but I sort of know

485
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:48,470
the general concept so we collected in

486
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:50,900
the United States and then in 2014

487
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,660
went to England and collected from old

488
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,170
known wild collected trees throughout

489
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,930
England Scotland and Wales and then

490
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,330
here's the National Champion a series

491
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:04,220
iam in Wales with my friend Chris Bach

492
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,970
tell from the Morton Arboretum in

493
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,970
Chicago

494
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:15,179
and then in 2015 Chris Bock tell Michael

495
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:17,789
Kong and I went to China to collect

496
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,950
across the range of ASA grism in China

497
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:22,799
and taking leaf samples so we traveled

498
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,930
within a 500-mile radius of Chien and

499
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,889
just to give you some perspective we

500
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:31,049
traveled about 1,600 miles in two weeks

501
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,850
which a 500-mile radius of Philadelphia

502
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,529
or Denver gives you some idea of the

503
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:36,599
area in which we traveled and so the

504
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:40,829
topography was probably more like Denver

505
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:42,980
than it was like Philadelphia and so as

506
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:45,269
I said here were the known collections

507
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,160
previously in the United States we were

508
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:50,190
taking leaf samples and wherever we

509
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,990
could seed there's only two places we

510
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,289
saw seed and so we you know we tried to

511
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,089
cover as much of the known range as

512
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:00,029
possible so comparing the two we really

513
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,919
expanded the range of collections and

514
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,950
just to give you another example of

515
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,350
where we collected so again we we I

516
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,019
think we feel that we've well sampled

517
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,329
the the range there was one population

518
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,200
that we couldn't find but we feel like

519
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:17,609
we've have a pretty good handle on it so

520
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,860
probably the most impressive tree we saw

521
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:23,369
was one that a colleague had seen in

522
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:27,149
1995 this is a tree growing outside of a

523
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:29,369
village in southern Joshi province and

524
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,100
colleagues of ours had seen this had

525
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,569
made notes and had GPS readings of where

526
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,059
this was so we were able to go back and

527
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,490
look at their notes and go right back to

528
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,559
that place so it really speaks to this

529
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,120
idea of keeping good records and one of

530
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,859
the things about collecting in the field

531
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,259
and being obtained garden is keeping

532
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:47,789
good records so you know this is a great

533
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,210
testimony that we were able to go right

534
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:52,680
back to that spot so the Morton

535
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,789
Arboretum doing this work has been able

536
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,080
to construct this molecular tree so the

537
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:00,269
main thing I want to point out is the

538
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,339
blue centre where it says who Bay Wilson

539
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,109
1901 these are all the plants in

540
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,659
cultivation from the United States and

541
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:08,519
from England so basically everything

542
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,650
that we've sampled in coloration came

543
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,660
from a collection that eh Wilson made in

544
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,940
1901 so that's what we call a genetic

545
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,850
bottleneck basically everything in

546
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,140
cultivation is one seed collection

547
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:20,759
supposedly a hundred trees germinated

548
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,320
then but

549
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,170
that's it and you can see in comparison

550
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,509
the other populations that we've sampled

551
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,130
the northern populations in China are on

552
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:32,369
the top and then the more southerly

553
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,680
populations are on the bottom so from

554
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:37,529
this data it looks like what we're not

555
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,200
well capturing what's in cultivation

556
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:42,990
right now there's a there's one missing

557
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,330
piece of this there's a major nursery on

558
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,759
the west coast and Oregon heritage

559
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:50,639
seedlings that grows something to the

560
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:54,210
tune of 40,000 ASA Grigio a year and

561
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,310
sells not just grows but cells and we've

562
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,529
sampled those and they're not included

563
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:00,509
in these so the last question is do they

564
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:02,879
have anything else that's not shown on

565
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:05,549
this slide and so once those data are

566
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,650
back we'll have the full picture and

567
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:09,599
we'll know which populations we need to

568
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,730
target for preservation in China so the

569
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,369
next steps are to work with our Chinese

570
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,650
colleagues to do in situ and ex situ

571
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:19,589
conservation of some of those more

572
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,150
threatened populations in China so

573
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:22,589
that's you know this projects been a

574
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,680
really exciting one that's taken about

575
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:27,509
four years now and it's been a really

576
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,039
gratifying project it's literally taking

577
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:34,200
me around the world and really been a

578
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,970
fun and interesting project so moving on

579
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,319
talking a little bit about insect and

580
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,910
disease resistance so I living in Ithaca

581
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,089
certainly you know kind of a hemlock

582
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,580
which is you know sort of a wonderful

583
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,379
forest species this is the the most

584
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,269
recent map I could find of the spread of

585
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,730
hemlock woolly adelgid that does seem to

586
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,379
be creeping up into this part of central

587
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,410
New York it's been a problem in

588
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:02,010
Philadelphia for 25 or more years and

589
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:04,230
and it basically saps the strength of

590
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:06,450
the hemlocks to the point where they're

591
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,120
very thin and weak and eventually

592
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,309
succumb to this or they can sort of limp

593
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,649
along with em aequo adelgid but they

594
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:15,089
really from a ecological point of view

595
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,970
and from an ornamental view they really

596
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:21,029
lose their value in either in the wild

597
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,980
or in the landscape Chinese hemlock is

598
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:25,889
appears to be resistant to hemlock

599
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,940
woolly adelgid the adelgid that is the

600
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:33,060
invasive one is a Japanese insect up

601
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,559
until the mid 90s there was then two

602
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,539
collections of Chinese Hema

603
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,980
and really two trees in the United

604
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,450
States so again a real genetic

605
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,490
bottleneck so if we wanted to look at

606
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,559
increasing the diversity for

607
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,750
hybridization work and for evaluation

608
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,609
work we targeted Chinese hemlock and

609
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,140
have made a number of collections in

610
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:51,509
central China

611
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,350
since the mid 90s here's Chris Bock tell

612
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:57,750
with the collection in 2005 and one of

613
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,730
the things we do as I said when we're

614
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,490
doing these collections we make we I'm

615
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:05,460
still living in the pen and pencil paper

616
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,829
or the pencil and paper world takes you

617
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,440
know scrupulous notes so that you know

618
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:11,579
people in 20 or 50 years know where we

619
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,890
were

620
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:18,659
we take herbarium specimens which are

621
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,100
deposited in various herbaria and we

622
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,810
spend our time you know in the nights

623
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,969
and evenings cleaning seed and getting

624
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,829
ready to package the seed and bring it

625
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,809
back to the United States so we

626
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:29,339
generally collect seed because if you

627
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:31,379
think about it you know hunger acorns

628
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,419
have a great deal of diversity and

629
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,180
they're really transportable if you try

630
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,580
and bring back 100 oak seedlings it's

631
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,410
it's very very challenging so you see

632
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,669
basically is prepackaged to travel

633
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,250
that's the whole point of seed is

634
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:47,240
dispersal so it makes our lives a lot

635
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:51,299
easier and so we are very meticulous

636
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,500
about cleaning and packaging our seed

637
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,049
and making sure we get it in

638
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,509
appropriately and with all you know the

639
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:59,490
appropriate permits so here we are

640
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:01,109
packing up at the end of one trip and

641
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,730
then the really exciting part is when

642
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:05,609
you see them germinate in your

643
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,430
greenhouse these are sugah geneticists

644
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:10,289
that we collect in 2005 and then growing

645
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,120
on in your greenhouse and then

646
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,819
eventually planted in the landscape so

647
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:17,519
that's you know the fulfilling part with

648
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,049
some of these collections so we're

649
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,879
actually at the stage with the Chinese

650
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:23,269
hemlock where we have a number of

651
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,340
collections in the garden we're

652
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:27,480
evaluating them for horticultural traits

653
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,849
and we're actually working on

654
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,099
propagation both vegetatively and

655
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:33,779
through seed to try and get some nursery

656
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,990
folks interested in growing this so this

657
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:39,720
is again a 20 to 25 year process from

658
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,569
inception through propagation and seed

659
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,059
production so it's been you know another

660
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:48,000
good example of how you know Botanic

661
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,559
Gardens can function so

662
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,359
again talking about insect and disease

663
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:54,059
resistance you probably all know about

664
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:58,259
the emerald ash borer I'm not sure how

665
00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:02,039
close it is it's very close to Tompkins

666
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:04,619
County so it's an insect introduced from

667
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,379
northern China into Detroit

668
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:09,869
it kills ashes all it seems to be all

669
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:13,230
native ashes by creating these galleries

670
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:16,649
in the cambium so it started out in the

671
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:19,500
Detroit Windsor Canada area and has

672
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:22,410
spread very quickly and I'll go through

673
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,680
these slides quickly in the last 12

674
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:28,500
years or so across the northeastern

675
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,580
United States and just keeps spreading

676
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,109
you know it's finally reached

677
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:34,409
Philadelphia about three or four years

678
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:37,229
ago and you can see it's it doesn't seem

679
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:41,490
to have any boundaries or any limits so

680
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:43,740
far and then the most recent most recent

681
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,170
map is September 2007 and you can see

682
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,730
it's kind of encircling it seems to be

683
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:53,460
going down the Erie Canal

684
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:55,410
all right highway 80 no no 80 90 and

685
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,650
then you know inching its way up from

686
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:01,290
Connecticut as well so as I said it

687
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,390
affects all native ashes American ash

688
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:05,490
which is you know has a wide native

689
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:09,470
range and you know wide widely planted

690
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:12,720
order culturally green ash fraxinus

691
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,750
Pennsylvania has an even wider native

692
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,190
range and if you live in the Dakotas or

693
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,440
in Montana it's one of your primary

694
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,450
street trees even if you live in Chicago

695
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,700
or Detroit so huge economic and

696
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,529
biological impact and so you know this

697
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,350
is sort of the scene you might see in

698
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:33,809
Michigan this is my wife's cousins

699
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:35,669
cottage in Michigan so it affects

700
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:37,049
everybody where it's really having a big

701
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,630
impact it's you know everybody knows

702
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:41,879
about this not just horticulturists and

703
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:45,690
these are slides from dan firms at Ohio

704
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,960
State in this is taken in Toledo Ohio

705
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,240
sort of a before and after shot so

706
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,150
they're huge you know implications for

707
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,069
this in many many ways stormwater runoff

708
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:59,610
heating and cooling costs removal costs

709
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:01,200
etc etc so and then you know there are

710
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:01,750
many nurseries that basically had the

711
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,019
terror

712
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,730
they're the nursery stock this is hints

713
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,279
down there 3 a big nursery outside of

714
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:12,700
Chicago destroying all their ashes about

715
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:16,629
10 years ago so with this in mind

716
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:19,000
starting around 2008 we decided to go to

717
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,970
China and collect a diversity of ash

718
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,980
species there was very little Asian ash

719
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,890
in the United States so the idea was to

720
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,660
collect you know expand a number of

721
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,310
species get them in the hands of people

722
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,070
who are doing research on this and look

723
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:37,119
for any inherent resistance and any

724
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:38,740
potential for breeding work so we

725
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,799
realized quickly that there are no ash

726
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,900
experts and we became the ash experts

727
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:48,129
sort of on the fly when we were there

728
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,960
and so we collected starting in 2008 and

729
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,790
going up until the last couple of years

730
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,250
a number of different species and I'll

731
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:56,109
just touch on a couple of these fraxinus

732
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,769
man Cherica which is essentially the

733
00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:03,579
green ash of China gets to be a large

734
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:07,180
tree it's a timber tree there there may

735
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:09,669
be some resistance here so we are

736
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:13,090
collecting those fraxinus in Solaris is

737
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:15,070
a medium-sized tree previously not known

738
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:18,639
in the United States it grows along

739
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:22,149
stream beds so perhaps might be a good

740
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,000
urban tree and it doesn't get too big so

741
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,180
this this has some potential as a urban

742
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,789
tree here it is growing a green tree on

743
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,850
the left is factionist in solaris and

744
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:36,279
then another tree fractions china ANSYS

745
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:39,269
which is sort of a smallish tree but

746
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:41,980
again this china ANSYS has a very

747
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:44,279
similar range to the emerald ash borer

748
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,380
so if there is any inherent resistance

749
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,639
track since china ANSYS might have it so

750
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,270
here we are collecting some along a

751
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,800
roadside so those were growing on at the

752
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:57,549
Arboretum we've gotten them into hands

753
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,259
of researchers in Ohio and in Michigan

754
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,359
who are doing work on this and this is

755
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:04,509
really a way we can serve as a conduit

756
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:10,419
to get material into the USDA and into

757
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:12,129
the Forest Service system so what time

758
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,570
one 10 10 minutes okay

759
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,370
I just want to talk a little bit about

760
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:16,869
traveling in China because

761
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,209
you know it's part of the whole

762
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:22,019
experience and it's sort of a immersion

763
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,850
in economic botany in and of itself so

764
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:27,099
you know this is still you know sort of

765
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:29,039
what you see when you're there you know

766
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:31,929
a day in your life traveling in China

767
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,808
and we might you know come across roads

768
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:37,600
like this or you know something like

769
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:41,019
this on the highway so I've never been

770
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:44,259
more terrified than driving in China I

771
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:47,589
try to tell my wife or show my wife some

772
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:49,240
of these slides you know so you just

773
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:50,889
sort of look out the window and hold

774
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,929
your breath when you're in these

775
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,480
situations you see all kinds of crazy

776
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:59,440
things when you're driving around I'm

777
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,630
not really sure whose idea this was so

778
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,210
you get out and fix the road while

779
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,640
you're there and then as I said you sort

780
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,069
of encounter this you're immersed in a

781
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,880
world of economic botany so this woman

782
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:16,269
is drawing a - Armand di cones which is

783
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,660
used as a pine nut and widely used as a

784
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:22,960
nut like - Angeles or the other pine

785
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,340
nuts and then there was a woman cracking

786
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,558
these and boiling he's sort of like

787
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:29,230
buying boiled peanuts in the south you

788
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,109
buy boiled pine nuts as you're traveling

789
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,240
through this was outside of xi'an and

790
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:36,779
then another roadside stop as i said was

791
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,599
just sort of this wonderful example of

792
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:42,369
economic botany in central near xi'an

793
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,599
there's a lot of kiwi productions so

794
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:45,699
kiwi is really the Chinese gooseberry

795
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,139
it's not you know New Zealand there

796
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,819
started to grow it and call it Kiwi but

797
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,800
it's really native to China so most of

798
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:52,299
the world's production for juice comes

799
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:57,069
from this part of China so here's

800
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:59,319
locally grown Kiwis plums apples two

801
00:32:57,069 --> 00:33:02,049
kinds of walnuts the English walnut and

802
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:04,359
Chinese walnut on the left chest not so

803
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:06,839
sort of a whole bounty of locally grown

804
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,579
things growing by the side of the road

805
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,230
and then just sort of experiencing you

806
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:13,419
know the different architecture and

807
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:16,179
different aspects of culture is pretty

808
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,910
remarkable there's still a lot of coal

809
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:22,300
being burned so it won't make any

810
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:25,060
political comments about that but you

811
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:29,009
still see coal everywhere this is our

812
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,009
hotel which sort of mimicked the local

813
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:33,220
architecture and then even being in

814
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,769
cities is pretty fascinating to see the

815
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,470
markets and just see what's going on in

816
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:41,168
the cities and what goes on on the

817
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,390
street is I think because of a lot of

818
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,270
homes in China are small there's a very

819
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,640
vibrant street life which is really

820
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:51,099
pretty fascinating here's you can have

821
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,780
your keys made at the local tea maker

822
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:57,849
there you can have your you know things

823
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:00,730
mended by the local seamstress out on

824
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:03,779
the street and so on one of my favorite

825
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,490
shops was the spice shop this was

826
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:08,918
basically could pick out your blend of

827
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,599
spices for hotpot and they had their

828
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,480
sort of house blend and then you could

829
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,639
pick out and make your own from the

830
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,590
various things that are there and my

831
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,369
favorite shop I love Chili Peppers this

832
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,899
was the local chili pepper shop and you

833
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:25,419
can see the grinder in the back so I

834
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:26,829
don't know what it's like to work here

835
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:29,888
but it certainly was an interesting

836
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:32,139
place to visit and then you know

837
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,000
wonderful street food as well

838
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:38,230
this woman has become sort of our

839
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,878
unofficial noodle shop in Xi'an so the

840
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,440
name like tony aiello I've been eating

841
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:45,398
noodles you know pretty much my whole

842
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,579
life these are you know among the best

843
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:50,679
bowls of noodles I've ever had and so we

844
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:55,690
every time we're there we go back and

845
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:59,530
this is a coal-fired stove scary but

846
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:01,480
delicious meal and then it's just really

847
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,790
interesting to see hand-pulled noodles

848
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,740
as well and I make my homemade pasta

849
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:11,259
pretty regularly but I don't do this so

850
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,549
this is pretty amazing but even after a

851
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,520
while you get a little tired of eating

852
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:21,940
noodles three meals a day so this is

853
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:24,219
what happens after a couple weeks so I'm

854
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,900
gonna skip a couple skip ahead for one

855
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:28,000
second just skip through these because I

856
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,460
want to focus on something that we've

857
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,889
done in the u.s. so and I'll wrap up

858
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,309
with this so we have done a fair amount

859
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:38,529
of collecting in the US and in 2012

860
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,869
again Michael dosa and I had this idea

861
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,619
of collecting live oak quercus Virginia

862
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:43,150
at the

863
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:45,338
northern limit of its range because we

864
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,230
had in the whole history of the Morris

865
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:50,108
Arboretum we've had two plants of live

866
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,400
oak in the 1950s which never made out of

867
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:53,139
the seedling beds and the Arnold

868
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,789
Arboretum has never had live oak in

869
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:57,338
their collection so we thought well why

870
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:59,349
don't we go to the northern limit of the

871
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:01,690
range both wild populations and

872
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:05,680
kolevatov plants collect acorns bring

873
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:07,960
them back grow them on and see if see if

874
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:11,139
there's any inherent hardiness among

875
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,970
them so and with you know with climate

876
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:15,219
change perhaps you know this may be a

877
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:18,848
plan of the future even in Philadelphia

878
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:21,368
so this slide shows in light green the

879
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:25,028
native range of live oak and you can see

880
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:27,910
in far southeastern Virginia one little

881
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:30,429
bright green county so it does get up

882
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:32,170
into southeastern Virginia and actually

883
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:34,808
crosses over into the Delmarva Peninsula

884
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,608
so we made a number of collections as I

885
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,710
said here's another slide showing its

886
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:42,130
native range the red dots show it in

887
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:46,568
Virginia we made collections starting in

888
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:49,739
Richmond and then going down to the

889
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:52,748
coast in Virginia Beach

890
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:54,730
so both Michael and I are northern boys

891
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:56,679
we didn't really know much about Live

892
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:59,230
Oak but we made a you know a number of

893
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,838
collections this is at a park in

894
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,028
Richmond there's a tree there in the

895
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,038
center which has been there probably for

896
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:08,219
about 100 years or so and Richmond may

897
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,630
be a tad bit warmer than Philadelphia

898
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:13,118
but pretty comparable so we thought if

899
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,499
this tree has survived for 100 years in

900
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,749
this park and you know maybe there's

901
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:19,268
something to it we also collected at

902
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:22,838
Williamsburg some trees there and then

903
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:24,729
again as I said in Virginia Beach so

904
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:25,869
again you know we're taking notes you

905
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,028
know even though we're in cultivated

906
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,588
areas where you know taking notes and

907
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:32,170
keeping track of what we're collecting

908
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:35,349
using the same processes again as I said

909
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,450
going down here clicking at William and

910
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:39,960
Mary and then in Colonial Williamsburg

911
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:42,548
itself we think these trees were

912
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,920
collected locally and planted there and

913
00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:46,809
they've been there again going on 100

914
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,150
years it's probably a little bit well

915
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:51,339
it's definitely warmer there than even

916
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,039
in Philadelphia but again just sort of

917
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:55,298
testing so that provenance and then

918
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,339
finally ending

919
00:37:55,298 --> 00:38:00,639
at the one of the northernmost

920
00:37:57,338 --> 00:38:02,858
populations in Virginia Beach here

921
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,078
Virginia this is a place called first

922
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:07,838
landing state park a fascinating State

923
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,630
Park it goes from the coast dunal

924
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,028
ecology on the coast to a bald cypress

925
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,099
swamp there are seven ecotypes in this

926
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:18,099
one State Park a really fascinating

927
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:21,640
place it's also the northernmost

928
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:25,059
population of tillandsia Spanish moss

929
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:28,118
yeah we didn't collect that but we were

930
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:30,759
tempted to do that and then here you can

931
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,679
see Michael on the right is a live oak

932
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:35,259
growing on the beach the darker green

933
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:38,489
and then in this sort of middle to his

934
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:42,039
left is Quercus in Cana another oak

935
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:44,469
growing on the dunes so a very obviously

936
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:47,199
very drought tolerant species and here's

937
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:49,479
some very old live oaks I don't know how

938
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,999
old these are but they're stolen in

939
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:55,228
forest so these this organism this plant

940
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:57,938
is probably 150 years old if not older

941
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:59,318
so we can't brought them back same kind

942
00:38:57,938 --> 00:39:03,398
of process we've had really good

943
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:06,188
germination of them and lots of plants

944
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:08,618
we overwinter them in a somewhat heated

945
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:10,568
greenhouse and an unheated poly house to

946
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:13,088
see if there's any effects and then just

947
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:16,599
last fall you can see some you know in

948
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:19,358
the spring some leaf damage even at 34

949
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,269
degrees so we threw those plants out and

950
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:24,398
then here they are again a winter in the

951
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:27,098
poly house again some damage and so

952
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:30,219
those plants get tossed planted them out

953
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:32,349
this past fall so they've had one not

954
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:35,708
very cold winter in Philadelphia out in

955
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:37,298
the field they all survived and so we're

956
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,678
waiting to see what happens over the

957
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:41,469
next couple of winters so we're kind of

958
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:45,369
in the early stages of evaluations of

959
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:46,778
these but perhaps in 50 years live oaks

960
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:48,608
will line the entrance to the Morris

961
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:50,139
Arboretum instead of magnolias we'll

962
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:53,619
just have to wait and see

963
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:55,419
so with that happy to take any questions

964
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,568
in the couple of minutes that we have

965
00:39:55,418 --> 00:39:57,568
left

966
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:10,599
[Applause]

967
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:12,660
oh sure any questions from Geneva we're

968
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:18,490
those purple plums in the market

969
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:22,088
Europeans or diploid I don't know

970
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:25,709
of course from Geneva I know and uh I

971
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:28,568
don't know they look more like Europeans

972
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:30,220
it could have been yeah they seemed

973
00:40:28,568 --> 00:40:32,710
pretty large and they seemed like what

974
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:35,288
we when I think of as a plum that we we

975
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,849
get here so I don't think they were any

976
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:50,829
sort of you know land race or anything

977
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:52,599
really unusual so Chinese hemlock seems

978
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:54,220
to have great resistance

979
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:55,660
I only say total resistance but seems

980
00:40:54,219 --> 00:41:00,308
have great resistance to hemlock wooly

981
00:40:55,659 --> 00:41:04,088
adelgid it does get some of the area

982
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:09,819
Renea scale but not not on the same

983
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:12,210
level as as our native hemlock so so and

984
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:13,630
you know so we've been evaluating it for

985
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,548
25 years

986
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,950
you know actively it really have not

987
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:22,298
seen any any impact there was some work

988
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:24,788
done by a graduate student at Yale

989
00:41:22,298 --> 00:41:27,849
looking at this and and as I said that

990
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:30,690
the woolly adelgid that we have is

991
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:33,369
Japanese and affects Japanese species

992
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,838
there are woolly adelgid in China that

993
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:57,130
affect the Chinese species but those

994
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:59,048
haven't been important to the US right I

995
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,140
think that's a that's interesting and

996
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:04,239
you know pretty complex question so I I

997
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:05,259
think you know from a horticultural

998
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,358
point of view I think there's great

999
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,700
potential and that's you know I think

1000
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,400
that's pretty obvious I I think it gets

1001
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:14,289
a lot muddier and difficult

1002
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,860
more difficult to sort of tease out when

1003
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:20,739
you think about you know whether or not

1004
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:23,289
should use these for naturalization or

1005
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:24,849
for you know reforestation and natural

1006
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:27,039
areas and it's sort of the question with

1007
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:28,900
the with the American chest even though

1008
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,849
it's you know fifteen sixteenths or

1009
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,619
thirty one thirty Seconds American

1010
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:35,909
chestnut is that truly an American chess

1011
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:38,230
another or not and so I think I think it

1012
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:39,759
my approach has really been more from a

1013
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,039
horticultural point of view and I think

1014
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,470
when you get into kind of restoration

1015
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:47,019
work it gets a little it gets a lot more

1016
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:51,159
complex yeah so I don't have a good

1017
00:42:47,019 --> 00:43:11,199
answer to that other questions any of

1018
00:42:51,159 --> 00:43:13,599
the grad students have a question so

1019
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,210
probably more at the ceiling growth so

1020
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,369
so the question is what do we evaluate

1021
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,840
when we look at invasive potential

1022
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:23,349
invasive this so the first thing we look

1023
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:28,000
at is how how it behaves in China or in

1024
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:29,949
the wild wherever we are so and then we

1025
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,480
look at how well it germinates in the

1026
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:33,339
greenhouse and if it germinates really

1027
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,960
really well we're excited by that

1028
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,100
because it's great to have a lot of

1029
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,230
seedlings but that you know is also kind

1030
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:44,710
of a warning sign at the same time and

1031
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:49,510
then if you sort of it gets through

1032
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:50,800
those filters so to speak we you know

1033
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,330
we'll plant them out in the garden and

1034
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,830
wash them and gardeners hate to pull

1035
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,960
weeds right so gardeners don't like

1036
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:58,480
weeds so if something starts to seed in

1037
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,860
the gardeners at the Arboretum or you

1038
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,699
know wherever they are the first sort of

1039
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,530
line of people who tell us about that so

1040
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:08,139
I've been you know a few cases where

1041
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:10,090
we've actively had things in the garden

1042
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:12,639
that we've eliminated so it's really

1043
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:17,260
through north of the life cycle as much

1044
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:19,659
as anything so we had collected in 2015

1045
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,720
there was a hydrangea aspera that we're

1046
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:24,579
very excited to collect in Sichuan we

1047
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,409
brought it back and had you know

1048
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,630
incredible seed germination which

1049
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:30,429
very exciting I happened to be in China

1050
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,588
again last year in 2016 and saw this

1051
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:34,629
hydrangea everywhere on roadsides

1052
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:36,369
everywhere so that's the kind of thing

1053
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,099
that makes you think well okay it's

1054
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:42,490
everywhere so it seems very adaptable it

1055
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:43,780
germinates very readily so maybe we

1056
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:45,959
really need to keep an eye on something

1057
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,960
like that

1058
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:05,048
yeah it's yep so the question is you

1059
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:07,420
know you know challenges to getting the

1060
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:10,088
nursery trade to grow super China ANSYS

1061
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:14,530
and and I've had the same experience in

1062
00:45:10,088 --> 00:45:17,318
and it's funny we sent cuttings to a

1063
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,640
nursery on the west coast who was able

1064
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:20,170
to grow them root them and grow them

1065
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,730
really well you know sort of you know

1066
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,789
climbing out there is so much better and

1067
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:28,539
produced these these great plants so he

1068
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:30,730
he sent us sort of his dregs of this and

1069
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:32,230
he had I forget how many you know a

1070
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,750
couple hundred plants from what the

1071
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,639
cuttings we sent him and he didn't know

1072
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,650
what to do with them because they you

1073
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,480
know on the west coast I don't know

1074
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,760
anything about him off woolly adelgid so

1075
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,010
he was essentially going to trash these

1076
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,049
really nice Chinese hemlock

1077
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,180
so I told him don't do that and you'll

1078
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:51,429
hold on to them and I'll find some

1079
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:54,278
nurseries on the East Coast that'll buy

1080
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:56,078
them from you so I think you know it's

1081
00:45:54,278 --> 00:45:57,880
it's one of those challenges that are

1082
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,710
really hard to overcome and I'm not sure

1083
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,660
what it is because I think there there

1084
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,130
is a market out there I think I've

1085
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:10,149
caught if a couple people start doing it

1086
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:12,608
maybe it will catch on right there are

1087
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,940
some seed sources that you can find and

1088
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:18,009
they germinate easily from seed so you

1089
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,318
know I can talk about that who has seed

1090
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,839
and I can always always have any said

1091
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:25,858
cuttings to people too so with that I

1092
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:25,858
want to thank Tony

1093
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:40,279
this has been a production of Cornell

1094
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:40,280
University on the web at Cornell edu
