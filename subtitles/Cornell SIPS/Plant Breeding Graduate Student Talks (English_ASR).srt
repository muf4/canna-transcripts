1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,879
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,878
University.

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,599
So thanks for being here. Uh good

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,439
afternoon everyone. Myself Shriant. I'm

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,960
a second year PhD grad student in plant

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,559
building and genetics. I'm from Mueller

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,080
Lab. Today before I would like to

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,839
explain the project that I'm working on

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,518
from past couple of months and before

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,960
diving into the project we would like to

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,278
I would like to explain some of the

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,599
fundamental concepts and essential to

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,359
build this project. So first what

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
exactly is a database? So database is

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,520
the system that is widely used across

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,558
the industry and academia for data

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
storage, data retrieval and data

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,359
management. So breedbase. So breedbase

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
is the relational database system that

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,719
is free and open source that our lab

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
developers have been built over the

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
years. They added a bunch of features uh

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
based on the brand building communities

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,479
request and now uh brand building

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,399
communities they can easily upload their

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,398
data into the breedbase and using the

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,160
analysis tools that our lab developers

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,359
have built they can analyze their data

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,599
and make datadriven decisions.

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,359
So using the breedbased instance our lab

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,599
also involved in developing a couple of

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,920
crop databases uh specifically for the

33
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,879
casawava casawa base musa that's for

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,118
banana am crop for ambase and sweet

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,798
database and there are many other crop

36
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,079
breedbased instances used by companies

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
but I cannot list them with this even in

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,280
the past year I worked on repetive

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,079
measurements in other words you can say

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,000
this as a time series feature uh it's

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,519
basically where you have a multiple

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
values for a given trade that you would

43
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,879
like to store. So this feature was

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
requested from UC Davis breeding program

45
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,158
and North Carolina State University

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
breeding program. Uh that therefore

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
we've implemented that. So with this now

48
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,920
I have a very good understanding of how

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
breedbase works and how the process of

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,840
breedbase actually is implemented. So

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
with this knowledge I would uh knowledge

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,118
and experience I would like to take

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
breedbase to the next level where I

54
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,959
would like to integrate artificial

55
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,879
intelligence in the breedbase. So before

56
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,798
actually diving into the what AI

57
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,319
application we will be building in uh

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
for the breedbase I would like to give

59
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,559
the uh brief statistics about the casava

60
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
base. As I mentioned in the previous

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,799
slide casavase is one of the largest

62
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,758
database as we have so far. So as of

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,920
March 2025 we have almost 240 GB of data

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:16,079
in the casava base out of which oh oh

65
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,159
sorry yeah out of which uh 12 GB is a

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,239
phenotypicing data. uh and uh why it is

67
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,919
not

68
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,920
working. Okay. Yeah. 118 GB is of

69
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,359
genotypic data and due to time

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,839
constraint I'll not go to the each

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,400
component of

72
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,239
this. I'm not sure why this is not

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,599
working. Okay. Yeah. Due to constraint I

74
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,120
cannot go through the each component.

75
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,518
However, I would like to pinpoint and

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
mention that Kasaw has been widely used

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
across the world in almost 550

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,039
locations. As you can see this database

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
is so much complex and it's a large

80
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,639
database, right? So we often use a

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,479
structured query language which is

82
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,318
called SQL language to communicate with

83
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,079
the databases. This is not the

84
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,000
observable trait in most of the plant

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
breeders or the community right to

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,318
communicate with the database. With this

87
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,158
in mind we would like to build a yeah we

88
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,039
would like to develop a chatbot uh for

89
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,560
the breed base using

90
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,719
LLMs. So first uh I would like to show

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,719
you the back end or the workflow how it

92
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,719
looks after it has been implemented or

93
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,479
deployed in the production site. So

94
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,120
imagine you are a user and you are

95
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,598
communicating with some AI. I hope

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,759
everyone have used chat GPT or Google B.

97
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,759
So they know right. So user might ask

98
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,158
hey how many trials do I have so far in

99
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,840
IIA breeding program. So then using the

100
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,318
rack technique that I'll describe in the

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,560
next slide uh they will extract the

102
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,560
trial uh column names and the table

103
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,799
names from the database for this

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
specific uh NL question that user asked

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
in the interface or in the chatbot. So

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,000
these both will be provided to the

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,920
fine-tuned LLM and LLM will write uh SQL

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,759
query which means it's another word

109
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,399
where you use to communicate with the

110
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,479
databases. So this will eventually be uh

111
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
executed on the database and that where

112
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,878
you get the output. So we do not like uh

113
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,719
we in addition to showing the value from

114
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,719
that we retrieved from the database we

115
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,158
would also like to show the generalized

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,519
statement along with the value.

117
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,239
Therefore this would be clear and

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,158
concise information to the user whoever

119
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,799
is querying.

120
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,158
Right. Uh yeah, of course it is true

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,239
that there are so many closed source

122
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,919
LLMs uh that are outperforming in

123
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,439
various tasks such as summarization,

124
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,839
code generation and lot many other

125
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,240
tasks. However, recently Stanford NLP

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,000
group have tested uh with the fi uh

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,400
various closed source models. They

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,240
fine-tuned their LLMs using those closed

129
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,079
source API keys and they found that

130
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
there is ineffectiveness in upgrading

131
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,439
existing knowledge. So what I mean by

132
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,319
that is once they fine-tuned their

133
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,160
models using this closed source APIs uh

134
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,560
after after that they modified their

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
data in the database and fine-tuned LLM

136
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
couldn't able to retrieve the updated

137
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,519
data and there are wide variety of

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
reason why this is happening but the

139
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,639
primary reason is uh closed source close

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,520
source LLM doesn't have a flexibility of

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,360
using different LLM techniques on the

142
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,478
fine-tuned model therefore you cannot

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,080
even improve the model accuracy or

144
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,439
performance right so with this uh I

145
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,439
referred a couple of times about the

146
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,519
closedource LLMs. So primarily those are

147
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,160
developed from open AI and the Google

148
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,240
and the cloud anthropic and the open

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
source LLMs are meta deepseek and

150
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
Microsoft. These are primarily deployed

151
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,879
on the hugging phase. From hugging phase

152
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,879
you can easily deploy onto your local

153
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,680
machine or the GPUs and then you can run

154
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,120
them. So for this project we will not be

155
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,038
using these closed source models.

156
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,160
However, we would be likely to use open

157
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,079
source LLMs uh to build this project. So

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,919
I mentioned LLM strategies in the

159
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,680
previous slide a couple of times, right?

160
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,519
uh first I would like to uh mention

161
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
about retrieval argument generation. So

162
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,279
as it is a $5 word and it's a simple

163
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
word as a name it indicates it's just a

164
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,198
retrieving. So basically if user ask

165
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,038
some question in the NL interface it

166
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,120
retrieves the table names or the column

167
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,000
names with respect to the database to

168
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
that question uh uh yeah to that

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
question. So it's not a high level of

170
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
coding that is required to implement

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,280
this technique or this objective. And

172
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
next comes the supervised fine tuning.

173
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,599
Supervised fine is a time consuming and

174
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,319
it's a iterative process and it's you

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
need to build a a training data set in a

176
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,719
way that it should include all the edge

177
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,638
cases even. So it's a high level of

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
coding that is also required. So next

179
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,160
last technique is reinforcement

180
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,038
learning. So reinforcement learning is a

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,840
branch of ML that is that we actually

182
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,599
basically use the AI train the AI agents

183
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,038
based on the trial and error method and

184
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
it's a high level of coding that is

185
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,879
required. There is no straightforward

186
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,038
mathematical framework or a mathematical

187
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,159
uh formula to directly deploy them. You

188
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,680
have to verify with a different

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,199
algorithms for this. With that, yeah,

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
with that I would like to thank my PI

191
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,319
for giving me exciting opportunity to

192
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,400
work on this and also I would like to

193
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,199
thank John for giving me access to the

194
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,239
GPUs to test it before trying to deploy

195
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
these uh models on the uh production

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
side. With that, I would like to open

197
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,599
the floor to any questions. Thank you so

198
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,919
much.

199
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah, last slide you listed a couple

200
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,079
different strategies. Is there any one

201
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,839
that you want to look at going forward

202
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,399
or are you going to try all three maybe

203
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,079
to see which one works best? Yeah, so

204
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,399
the question is uh in this slide that

205
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,318
I'm showing right now uh she mentioned

206
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,318
that I'm I showed here different

207
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,720
techniques, right? Uh do I use all of

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
those or do I use only one among among

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
the three? So these three techniques are

210
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,758
very important in order to make this

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
objective efficient. So you cannot use

212
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,240
only one. So these three techniques are

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,160
combined to build this chatbot. Meaning

214
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,639
all these three uh techniques are very

215
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,639
useful. So it's doing one one technique

216
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,199
is doing one job. You have to combine

217
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,160
all these three techniques.

218
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,280
Yeah. Like so you're using the cassava

219
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,360
data set to how hard would it be to then

220
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,799
use another data set for another crop

221
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,160
like to translate this to another crop?

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,759
Would you have to rebuild and train the

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
model all over again or would it be

224
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,479
easily trans? Yeah. uh the question here

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,399
in the audience is uh currently I'm

226
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,879
using the casava base for the initial

227
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,560
stage to build this uh if we eventually

228
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
in the future if I transfer to the other

229
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,519
crop or other databases how easy or how

230
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
hard is it so the simple question is for

231
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,279
our example we have a multiple crop

232
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,439
databases right so for casava base and

233
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,439
most of the databases we have a same

234
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,439
structure so what I mean by structure so

235
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,759
the table names column names all are

236
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,759
same across the uh different crops only

237
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
the values or some functionality might

238
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,160
change right so if you implement Kazava

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,918
base and it working fine as we expect.

240
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
So in order to scale up to the other

241
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,519
databases, we need to change the table

242
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,639
names and the column names in those

243
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,680
databases to specifically to those crops

244
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
in order to make it. Yeah, that's a

245
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,280
problem. Um yeah, so my name is Chris

246
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,959
Merate. I'm a fourth year uh PhD student

247
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,199
in Lar's lab uh in Cornell uh agreech in

248
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,119
Geneva. And today I would like to do an

249
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,560
updated summary of my work on mapping

250
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,679
QTL and identify u candy genes for seed

251
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,439
aeronomic traits in hemp F2 my

252
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,519
populations. So to start off I would

253
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,680
like to for for some of you that are not

254
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,200
familiar with this crop there are three

255
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,679
main market classes in hemp flour fiber

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,839
and grain. Uh for the flower obviously

257
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,838
the um the end product is the struction

258
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,600
of canabonoids for these flowers. Uh but

259
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
for all these market market classes

260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
there are key traits to take into

261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,759
account when considering cultivars and

262
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,079
when breeding um cultivars for the

263
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,278
flower per se uh the idea is to increase

264
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,519
the floral biomass. So flowering uh time

265
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,519
is one important trait to consider and

266
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,039
obviously canabonoids as well uh which

267
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
is not something that I'm going to cover

268
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,360
today. For the fiber the ideal is to

269
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
harvest the stem. So we also want based

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,200
on the eotype you can see here for

271
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,439
example is a tall non-branchy late

272
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,879
flowering cultivar. So one of the

273
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
important traits is flowering time as

274
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,360
well as biomass to ensure that we have

275
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,959
this accumulation of biomass and fiber

276
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
quality is another important trait. So

277
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,559
from this biomass that is accumulated we

278
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,440
can remove this bus from the herd for

279
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,199
the um uh to maximize the bass

280
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
production for textiles or the hair

281
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,440
production if the intent is for

282
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,600
construction materials. And lastly we

283
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
have the grain. Another market classes

284
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
that is embedded in it is the dual

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,120
purpose which stands for production of

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,278
the grain and the stock. So you harvest

287
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,519
the inflloresence and then you harvest

288
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:09,360
the stocks at the end. Uh so you can get

289
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,839
fiber and um and grain as well. Uh and

290
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,839
here the again one of the mark the key

291
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
traits to consider is flowering time

292
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,360
because we want to ensure that we

293
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,000
accumulate biomass so this crop reaches

294
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,919
a sufficient height for an optimal

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,519
harvest. Um and uh for incred sorry and

296
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:30,799
in mets meat sorry the uh goals whether

297
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,959
it's dual purpose or grain only um and

298
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,559
biomass as well because we want to have

299
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,879
that balance between certain

300
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,518
accumulation biomass for both fiber and

301
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,240
grain and obviously I'm not going to uh

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,679
forget grain yield and seed quality

303
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,919
especially the seat quality is another

304
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,759
important trait in this case what we are

305
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,599
considering quality right now is the

306
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,799
seat size as well as the protein oil

307
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,240
content

308
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,599
But speaking of um seat size, so here in

309
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,839
this picture you can see the variation

310
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,759
on seat size that we have in our general

311
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,519
plasm in Geneva. Um and from the

312
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,720
importance standpoint actually seat size

313
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,639
could be beneficial for stand

314
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
establishment. Uh from a consumer

315
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,399
perspective a larger seat will be more

316
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
appealing for a consumer and from a

317
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,039
processing point of view this we have uh

318
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,000
observed that larger seats may lead to a

319
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,679
better processing of these seeds. So

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,519
traditionally hemp hearts that you see

321
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,359
and you can access commercially are

322
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,600
seats that originate from cultivars that

323
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,039
are not that different from

324
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,800
um seat size that equates beli or felina

325
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,639
32 that you see here or perhaps even

326
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,039
smaller than this. So we're interested

327
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,480
in uh looking at the processability of

328
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,639
these larger seats that you see on the

329
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,920
left as well as of course the genetic

330
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,679
mechanisms underlying that um trait or

331
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,120
the seat size alone. So this hemp grain

332
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,159
which is no grain it's on a kein

333
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,480
actually uh once it's harvested it is uh

334
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,159
processed um and here you can you can

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
get two main components of the seeds the

336
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,319
hemp hearts which are actually the kons

337
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,600
of the seeds and the hemp holes the hemp

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,600
hearts are high in protein uh about 20

339
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,519
20 to 25% protein the fat is about 25 to

340
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
35 if I'm not mistaken and the holes

341
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,440
which are the perarb of this uh akin is

342
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,839
high in dietary fiber about 25 to 35% as

343
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
well But ultimately the end product of

344
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,320
these components become into hemp seed

345
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,480
meal, hemp seed oil, fortified foods

346
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,240
like baked goods as well as plant-based

347
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,879
meats and dairies that you can see here

348
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,120
highlighted in this um this graph. So

349
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,120
with all of this in mind, I established

350
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
three objectives and those are to

351
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,919
identify significant QTL for seat size

352
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,679
and aloromic traits and to compare uh or

353
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,319
determine the consistency of this QTL

354
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,479
between three populations that will

355
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,079
represent each of the market classes and

356
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,159
identify hopefully the candidate genes

357
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,078
within the 1.5 low interval for each of

358
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,199
these

359
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:55,759
QTL. So to start off uh in 2021 a high

360
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,759
canominoid F2 population was developed

361
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,399
crossing an parameial resistant colonial

362
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,799
individual of 58 NGCBD

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,879
um chron individual that is parameible.

364
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,879
The idea here or the main uh goal of

365
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,879
this uh was to characterize parame

366
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,439
resistance as I was saying however other

367
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,519
phenotypes were measured. uh for this

368
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,720
the crossing scheme was the selfing of

369
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,720
two uh selected F1s generating two f2s

370
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,240
and the idea of having more than one f2

371
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,160
is so that because h is highly

372
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,919
heterrozygous having more than one

373
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,759
population increases our likelihood to

374
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,120
capture the effect of alo present in the

375
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,720
parents. So here we have 214 and 215

376
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,759
with 366 and 304 individuals

377
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,040
respectively. U another important thing

378
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,240
to mention is that the flowering time

379
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,439
between these two parents is about a

380
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,639
week. Um so they probably relatively um

381
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
I want to say early but not too late

382
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,240
either. Uh for the green population in

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,360
this case we employ a dualpurpose green

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,440
line. Uh this one is 201179 or GBH 2011

385
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,440
1179 which is a late flower individual

386
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,000
large seeded compared and crossed with a

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
picodo which is a very popular Canadian

388
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,839
uh grain cultivar that has high protein

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,759
content that has u small seed and early

390
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
flowering. In this case, the custom

391
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,879
scheme was developed to a sip mating of

392
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,278
uh the F1s and we ended up phenotyping

393
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,919
only the females uh 198 of them. For the

394
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:23,039
fiber uh in this case we use fiber bre

395
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:26,078
to GBA 19 uh 1024. This is a very late

396
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,319
flowering a very large seated um uh

397
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,559
cultivar population and was crossed with

398
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,199
the first New York uh feral population

399
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,359
isolated which is Logan. uh this is a

400
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,078
very early and a very small seated uh

401
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,919
cultivar. In this case, we also did se

402
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,559
mating for the generation of the F2s.

403
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:46,319
But here we phenotype and genotype uh

404
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,479
females and males having a total of 445

405
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,519
um

406
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,278
individuals. For the creation of the

407
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,839
linkage maps, we use two genotypic

408
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,838
platforms uh genotyping platform sorry.

409
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,040
Uh for a high calamina population uh

410
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,839
21,04 and 21,05 we use an illuminina

411
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,759
array developed by Pho. uh here we ended

412
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,720
up with linkage maps that have uh

413
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,639
2,659 and 2,197 markers respectively.

414
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Whereas for the grain FI population we

415
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,560
use an agulant sure select props set

416
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,519
that we developed in our lab which we

417
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:21,439
named hand select um and um this

418
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,078
eventually uh help us develop or create

419
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,199
a linkage linkage maps that have 748

420
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:30,159
markers for the grain and 922 markers

421
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,759
for the fiber. So with all this in mind

422
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,159
uh on all these methodologies so I

423
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,120
decided to look at the seat size in this

424
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,078
case we quantify that by the weight of

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,639
10,000 seats or thousand sew as you can

426
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:49,039
see here first in the high population

427
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:50,879
2004 we found uh five QTL that um are

428
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,198
associated with this trait and as you

429
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,958
can see here the uh largest peak is

430
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,719
located in chromosome one that explain a

431
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,119
good portion of the variance and it's a

432
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,680
very small region relatively speaking uh

433
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,198
in the genome and we see that the effect

434
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,239
of the AL is dominant over the B al for

435
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:10,078
the population we also find uh a QTL in

436
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
chromosome one but conversely this is

437
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,919
the only QDL that we find explaining low

438
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
proportion of the variance but in a very

439
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,519
large region and in this case the effect

440
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,919
of the AL over the B al seems to be

441
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,600
additive for the grain we have four QTL

442
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,838
identified and in this case we don't

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
observe this we observe that the largest

444
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,320
effect the largest uh peak is in

445
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,638
chromosome 9 instead explaining uh a

446
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
considerable a considerable part of

447
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,440
percentage of the variance sorry but a

448
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,399
large region and also seems to be

449
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,120
additive and in the fiber very interest

450
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,360
inly we only find two QTL but a massive

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,759
peak in chromosome 4 that explains over

452
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,600
60% of the variance in a population and

453
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
but unfortunately the region is quite

454
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,399
large it's 9.1 megabases and here the

455
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,079
additive effect uh sorry the effect of

456
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,399
the B al over the AL is

457
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:01,758
additive now for the flowering time. Um

458
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,078
this in this case we for 214 in the high

459
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,880
can population we find one large peak in

460
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,519
chromosome one again compared to the um

461
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,959
the one forc weight uh that explains

462
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,439
also a good proportion of the variance

463
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,679
and it's a small region uh the effect of

464
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,759
this alil is again dominant um as you uh

465
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,759
compared to the one identified in the

466
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,519
tasan ce uh for 215 uh we also also

467
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,798
observe another peak well two peaks

468
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,038
actually but the largest peak in

469
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:32,000
chromosome one explaining 20% of the

470
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,240
variance in a large over 20% in a large

471
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,880
region. Um and in this case the effect

472
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
is additive. For the grain, we only find

473
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,400
one um peak in chromosome one that

474
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,000
explains over half% of the variance. And

475
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,519
in this case, this alil seems to be

476
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,359
additive. And for the fiber, we observe

477
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,279
the most UT identified for flowering

478
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:57,439
time uh four one to five actually to be

479
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:59,359
precise. But again uh the most um the

480
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,279
largest peak is in chromosome one uh

481
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,479
with an additive effect uh but

482
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,480
unfortunately doesn't explain that much

483
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
of the varian. So what you see here uh

484
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
is highlights the importance of this

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,519
chromosome one or the presence of

486
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,320
flowering time genes in this uh

487
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,759
chromosome one u in the cannabis genome

488
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,038
at least for gen that we're evaluating

489
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,599
here and lastly for biomass which uh I

490
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,679
would expect that will coincide with the

491
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,798
flowering time and for this family it

492
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,679
does uh proportional variance uh same

493
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,000
with the genetic region but again this

494
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,559
uh is an additive alil uh compared to

495
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,400
the B al uh for hikabinoid 2005 uh again

496
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,599
there's a peak here there's no there are

497
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,160
not many doesn't explain much of the

498
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,558
variance but it's still there and I'm

499
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
seeing the same thing in grain larger uh

500
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,639
the largest peak or the only peak in

501
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,880
chromosome one equates to the one in the

502
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,360
flowering time uh explaining compression

503
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,600
of the variance but a large region but

504
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,240
in the fiber however uh we don't observe

505
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,079
that peak in chromosome one that should

506
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,558
coincide with flowering time but instead

507
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,079
is only uh in chromosome 6 which is very

508
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,038
interesting for us however doesn't

509
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,399
explain than much of the variance but um

510
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,720
uh is interesting

511
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,720
nonetheless and yeah so with that uh the

512
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,880
key takeaways are that the chromosomal

513
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
location for largest effect QTL for seat

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
size measure as a thousand C weight uh

515
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,720
differs depending on the location on the

516
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
population that we use uh the largest

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
effect of this QTL for flowering time in

518
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,960
all population was located in chromosome

519
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
one the largest effect UTL for biomass

520
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
seems to coincide with that for flower

521
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
in all populations except the one in

522
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,240
fiber which in chromosome

523
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
And one thing I don't know if you if you

524
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,319
caught it, but there seems to be a one

525
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,080
plyotropic dominant effect QTL in

526
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,119
chromosome one for this high canal

527
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,519
population in

528
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,759
214. Um so with that I would like to

529
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,279
thank all the members of the lar lab as

530
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,038
well as my founders funding sources

531
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,000
listed here and I will welcome any

532
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:57,038
questions.

533
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,519
The big range of planting densities for

534
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,319
hemp like super dense for fiber, super

535
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,359
sparse for canonoids. How'd you pick the

536
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,839
density or the densities used for this

537
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,439
study? And does that have like a complex

538
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,519
I mean does that impact impact flowering

539
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,240
time and total seedling differently like

540
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,798
in the fiber by parentals versus like

541
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,798
the canonoid or grain by parentals?

542
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,519
Yeah. So the question is if how I

543
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:27,759
decided the planting density and if that

544
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:30,960
affects the traits uh phenotype here. Um

545
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,640
so the plant density was y spacing. So

546
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,159
for example, one trait that will

547
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,320
ultimately be affected by a plant

548
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,280
density is yield uh for biomass as well

549
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,359
as um seed yield. That's definitely

550
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,639
affects flowering time however does not

551
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,959
seem to be affected by the plant

552
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,400
intensity. Uh and the seed size does not

553
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,480
seem to be affected either as well.

554
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
So I was wondering you have a lot of QTL

555
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,159
on chromosome one and you said it might

556
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,079
be due to the pleotropic effects from

557
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,159
that one parent population. Have you

558
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,720
looked further into those QTL to see if

559
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,400
it's like one major one or two major

560
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,400
genes that seem to be controlling this

561
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,159
effect or are there QTL in like very

562
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,519
different locations on that chromosome?

563
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,880
This is why I like you Emily. Okay, so I

564
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,400
did not have the time to incorporate

565
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,880
this in the presentation. So I was

566
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,880
hoping somebody will ask that. Uh I do

567
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
so we do have the sequencing the actual

568
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,240
sequence of the parents in this hikino

569
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,120
population. Um and we were able to have

570
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,480
um uh what is that called? um the

571
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,319
structural and functional predictions of

572
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,038
the genes located. So what I was able is

573
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,599
to section the regions of that specific

574
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,480
uh QTL and compare them each other with

575
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,480
each other and see what differs. And the

576
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,480
one that I identify as the one differing

577
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,640
is this Luke 7 like protein in

578
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,720
chromosome one. Uh and there is this G

579
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,080
insertion that causes a frame mutation

580
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:54,120
frame shift mutation uh in this habype.

581
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:58,359
Um this looks like protein is um oh

582
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:02,879
sorry um it it's

583
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:05,199
um uh homal to a luke 7 RL in the

584
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
arabidopsis um and this seems to

585
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,400
participate as an accessory protein to

586
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,880
the U1 uh small nuclear ribbonuclear

587
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,559
protein in the splyosome so it affect

588
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,360
it's it's affected or affects the

589
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,480
um RNA maturation of several genes and

590
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,639
group ineneral Germany actually

591
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,200
validated this by knocking it out,

592
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,320
knocking it out and testing like what is

593
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,200
uh upregulated regulated and what um

594
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,678
several um outcomes that they got from

595
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,720
that which uh highlights a plyotropic

596
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:41,120
effect um in the raidopsis um organism.
