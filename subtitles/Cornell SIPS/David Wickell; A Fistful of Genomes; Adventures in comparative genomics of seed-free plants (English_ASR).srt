1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,700
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,700
University

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:16,079
there's a lot of people in case you came

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,240
to the wrong room I'm David wickle this

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,339
is my exit seminar and today I'm going

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,019
to talk to you about some of the

7
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,939
comparative genomics that I've done in

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,939
seed-free Plants over the last few years

9
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,320
so first why study seed free Plants

10
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,899
despite the fact that they're sometimes

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,558
easily overlooked in the shadow of

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,820
dominant or angiosperm dominated Flora

13
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,099
Seafood plants especially Ferns and

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,980
lycophytes are really cool they're

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,160
incredibly diverse in form they inhabit

16
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,898
a diverse array of habitats and serve as

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,159
important members of the ecosystems

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,859
where they're found

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,979
as their name implies they don't use

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,378
seeds instead they reproduce via spores

21
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:01,078
which can create these independent

22
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,420
haploid gametophytes that then go on to

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,819
release sperm that fertilize eggs

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,040
producing sporophytes starting the whole

25
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,459
cycle over again uh they're also

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,618
evolutionarily important uh so ferns are

27
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,839
the sister lineage to all seed plants

28
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,938
and lycophytes are sister to all other

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,340
vascular plants they've retained lots of

30
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,258
important ancestral traits uh things

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,659
like vasculature and sporophyte

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,879
branching and have also independently

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,159
evolved key features like roots and

34
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,560
leaves and this is really important

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,118
right we're making comparisons that can

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,439
help give us an idea about the hidden

37
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,438
processes that guide evolution

38
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,938
so I've talked about why seed free

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,400
Plants but why genomics the last 10

40
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:47,219
years have been a real Renaissance for

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,500
genomic research there's been a surge in

42
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,700
the number of assemblies published as

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,159
you can see over the years on this

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,320
y-axis and also in the quality of those

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,740
assemblies or sorry x-axis as shown on

46
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,500
the y-axis here uh despite this surge in

47
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:02,759
genome assemblies right there are a lot

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,319
of orders that are still poorly

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,019
represented and and that's because

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,879
genomics tends to focus on species that

51
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,878
are economically important or that have

52
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,439
small genomes and unfortunately those

53
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,899
kind of plants are in the minority among

54
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,639
Ferns and lycophytes so there are lots

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,099
of orders of ferns for which there are

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,079
no genome assemblies and as of when I

57
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,639
started this PhD a couple orders of

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,180
Leica fights that also did not have any

59
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,179
genomes

60
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,219
so today I'm going to talk to you about

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,840
my research and uh comparative genomics

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,219
I'm going to start off by talking a

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,319
little bit about whole genome

64
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:40,139
duplication using a couple of our genome

65
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,000
assemblies as case studies uh then I'm

66
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,559
going to talk to you about ice sweetie's

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
taiwanensis and change gears a little

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,580
bit to talk about cam photosynthesis and

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,840
the convergent evolution of Pam and this

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,400
aquatic lineage

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,378
and I'm going to finish up talking about

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,780
my latest research looking into the

73
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,459
recurrent formation of aloe polyploids

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,000
in the ice sweetie's appalachiana

75
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,000
complex

76
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,120
so let's get started with whole genome

77
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,280
duplication

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm going to talk just a little bit more

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
about genomics of seed free plants and

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,800
specifically I want to talk about the

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,980
difference between heterosporous

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,959
lineages versus homosphorus lineages so

83
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,818
briefly heterosporous lineages which

84
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,080
include all seed plants all flowering

85
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:22,500
plants

86
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,599
um produce two different types of spores

87
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,219
that then go on to produce two different

88
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,378
types of gametophytes one of which

89
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,199
produces sperm and one of which produces

90
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:34,018
an egg homosphorus lineages on the other

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,818
hand produce a single hermaphroditic

92
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,759
medophyte capable of producing both

93
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,098
sperm and egg and this distinction is

94
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,500
important for genomics primarily because

95
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:46,378
homosporous lineages tend to have much

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,900
larger genomes characterized by much

97
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:51,120
more numerous chromosomes so in the

98
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,219
ferns the vast majority of lineages are

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,400
homosporous the one exception being the

100
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,680
order salvini allies the water ferns to

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
heterosporous within lycophytes the

102
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,480
majority of species are heterosporous

103
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,518
but the earliest diverging lineage

104
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,979
lycopodiales is entirely homosporous

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,500
uh so like I was talking about earlier

106
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,938
right hemosphorus plants tend to have

107
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,919
much larger genomes much more

108
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:16,978
chromosomes an extreme example is shown

109
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,539
over here in ophioglossom reticulatum uh

110
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,899
which has a chromosome count of over

111
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,240
1200 chromosomes if we compare this to a

112
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,279
heterosporous angiosperm the grass panic

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,460
and Virginia Autumn which I believe is

114
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,739
actually a tetraploid it only has 36

115
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,299
chromosomes this is an extreme example

116
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,120
but it's a pattern that's borne out

117
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,800
across all vascular plants where we see

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,600
that homosporous lineages on average

119
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,759
have three to four times the number of

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,500
chromosomes as their related

121
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,040
heterosporous lineages

122
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,040
see

123
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:51,060
so I'm going to explain a whole genome

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,620
duplication briefly right that's what

125
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,060
the section is about

126
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,160
um whole genome duplication is very

127
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,220
common among all vascular plants

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,620
particularly Ferns and lycophytes and

129
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,080
essentially it consists of of just the

130
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,660
duplication of all the chromosomes in

131
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,819
inside of a plant uh this is fascinating

132
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,080
to me because I feel like you know I was

133
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,360
taught that Evolution was a sort of

134
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,399
gradual process right where one mutation

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,240
Builds on another over enormous periods

136
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,099
of time

137
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,319
but whole genome duplication suddenly

138
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,139
and rapidly changes the entire Genome of

139
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,719
a plant resulting in usually immediate

140
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,060
genetic isolation from its parental

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,460
lineages and also in drastic changes to

142
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,379
its phenotype while providing the raw

143
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:35,339
material for evolution right in the form

144
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,779
of more genes more chromosomal material

145
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,638
but if this were the end of the story

146
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,038
right we would expect to see plant

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
lineages heterosporous and hemosphorus

148
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,779
characterized by large numbers of

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,000
chromosomes by multi-somic inheritance

150
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,978
by by polyploid expression of genes and

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,680
we don't see that instead even in

152
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:54,060
lineages like say arabidopsis with a

153
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,639
known history of whole genome

154
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,978
duplication we see relatively small

155
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,840
genomes with diploid expression and

156
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,000
dysomic inheritance and that's because

157
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,239
of this process of diploidization

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,300
uh so diploidization is the process by

159
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,038
which we go from the state right through

160
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,439
the polyploid state and back to

161
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,759
something resembling a diploid and this

162
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,038
happens through chromosomal

163
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,740
rearrangements uh that restore pairing

164
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,318
of chromosomes at meiosis uh and also

165
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,538
through large-scale loss of genes and

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,180
chromosomal material uh typically

167
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,279
through illegitimate recombination that

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,680
can lead to a variety of outcomes right

169
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,198
that further serves to isolate these

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,280
lineages from one another as well as the

171
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,280
ones that gave rise to them

172
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,319
so because of this process of

173
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,000
diploidization it can be difficult to

174
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,979
detect whole genome duplications that

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,439
happened far back in time an

176
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,418
evolutionary time so we do that by a few

177
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,219
different methods the first one is KS

178
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,439
and KS functions on the principle that

179
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,139
when a gene is duplicated the two

180
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,478
duplicates are identical as they diverge

181
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,960
we can plot that Divergence along the

182
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:07,079
x-axis so if we compare many genes right

183
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,339
within a genome what we expect to see if

184
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,560
there's no history of whole genome

185
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,779
duplication is is what we see down here

186
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,899
in the bottom corner in silaginella a

187
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,899
sort of exponential decrease in the

188
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,519
number of genes and that have higher KS

189
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,918
values right this is a result of

190
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,560
fractionation genes being lost over time

191
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,060
as the Divergent sequence

192
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,860
but in the case of a whole genome

193
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,839
duplication we expect to see these Peaks

194
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,580
and those Peaks represent a cohort of

195
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,619
genes that were all duplicated at the

196
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,538
same time and then are diverging at

197
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,800
relatively the same rate so this is the

198
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,478
first evidence that we can use to

199
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,439
identify whole genome duplications the

200
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,959
second

201
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,120
is phylogenetic reconciliation

202
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,839
phylogenetic reconciliation we take many

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,478
Gene trees from many species and then we

204
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,279
compare them to a known species tree and

205
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,959
what we look for in those Gene trees are

206
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,119
branches or clades that are duplicated

207
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,098
over and over and over again in multiple

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,199
Gene trees represented by this line here

209
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,060
right the percentage of times we see

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,680
these nodes duplicated and if we see

211
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,360
nodes that are duplicated far more than

212
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,280
others we can infer that maybe a

213
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,598
duplication happened there and the

214
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,399
important thing about phylogenetic

215
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,680
reconciliation is it doesn't simply tell

216
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,120
us if duplications occurred it can tell

217
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,699
us when they occurred and place them

218
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
into this evolutionary context

219
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,478
the final way that we identify ancient

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,720
whole genome duplications and arguably

221
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,060
sort of the gold standard is syntony

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,500
so with syntony right this operates on

223
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,478
the concept that

224
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,820
when a chromosome is duplicated an

225
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,379
entire chromosome all the genes along

226
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,659
that chromosome start out in the same

227
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,759
order over time through diploidization

228
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,819
those genes can be shuffled around those

229
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,099
genes can be lost but still for millions

230
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,260
or tens of millions of years blocks of

231
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,720
genes that are collinear or synthetic

232
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,759
exist and we can detect those and those

233
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,278
are evidence that at some point in the

234
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,100
past there was a large scale duplication

235
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,720
right of entire chromosomes so these

236
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,759
plots here actually so centinate between

237
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,500
two different species so you can do

238
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,720
Symphony either within a species right

239
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,700
and if you see synthetic blocks you

240
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,980
expect that there was a duplication or

241
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,019
you can compare them between species and

242
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,899
for instance if you see a duplication in

243
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,060
species a but not in species B you would

244
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,799
expect each block in species B here

245
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,899
represented by dots or here represented

246
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,659
by lines to be represented twice in

247
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,458
species a so syntony similar to

248
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:25,799
phylogenetic reconciliation can give us

249
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:29,299
an idea of which duplications are shared

250
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,299
between different lineages

251
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,539
all right now that we're all experts in

252
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,040
detecting whole genome duplication I'm

253
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,899
going to talk about the first genome

254
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,360
today and that's that of al-sophilus

255
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,039
spinulosa this assembly was produced in

256
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,839
collaboration with researchers at the

257
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,120
Chinese Academy of Forestry

258
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,200
and I have some assembly stats up there

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,700
but that's not what I'm going to talk

260
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,320
about today instead we're going to stick

261
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,839
to wgd

262
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,580
um even in the best of scenarios when

263
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,920
you have all of the possible evidence

264
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,600
available to you uh detecting whole

265
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,639
genome duplications can be relatively

266
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,040
straightforward by figuring out how many

267
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,559
happened and when they occurred is often

268
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,079
not and that's demonstrated by this

269
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,579
phylogeny here where I've plotted uh the

270
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,379
result of four different studies over

271
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,540
the last four years that looked at whole

272
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,919
genome duplication in the sciately or

273
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,360
the tree ferns right the group to which

274
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,579
this Fern belongs

275
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,320
every single one found different

276
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,019
conclusions represented by these circles

277
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,640
on the phylogen so each of these uh is a

278
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,259
whole genome duplication right inferred

279
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,179
by a different study

280
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,860
um I want to draw your attention briefly

281
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,838
to these with the asterisk different

282
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,060
studies use different species in their

283
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,800
sampling and in these two cases they

284
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,319
only included a single species from the

285
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,699
sciatic AC so it's possible had they had

286
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,740
better sampling and included more

287
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,300
species from that group that they would

288
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,299
have inferred a duplication of the same

289
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,620
place that we did by the way ours are on

290
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,419
here in yellow but you'll see them again

291
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,940
later

292
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,439
uh so we did the usual battery of tests

293
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,420
right that I just talked about uh

294
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,339
phylogenetic reconciliation identified

295
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,379
two duplications one before the

296
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,200
Divergence of ciathease another before

297
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:04,139
the Divergence of the ciaes uh this was

298
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,120
largely recapitulated by KS uh within

299
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,220
the sciatic AC we can see two peaks

300
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,778
represented here in blue and orange

301
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,160
um in the CIA leaves it's a little

302
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,620
harder to see because it's a very old

303
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,679
duplication but we can see a single Peak

304
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,120
more diffuse uh further out from the

305
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,319
y-axis

306
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,659
but

307
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,959
what was really exciting about this

308
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,838
particular analysis uh was the symphony

309
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,179
so as I said earlier right symphony is

310
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,220
is lost as species diploidized and

311
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,958
becomes less and less informative so

312
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,180
generally over scales of millions or

313
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,219
tens of millions of years it becomes

314
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,439
harder and harder to detect

315
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,639
our most recent whole genome duplication

316
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,260
that we identified in this group

317
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,259
happened over a hundred million years

318
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,299
ago and yet despite that we see this

319
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,399
incredible amount of symphony uh with

320
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,338
each one of these lines representing a

321
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,500
synthetic Gene pair and more than that

322
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,360
uh this one's not organized particularly

323
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,578
well to show that but we see an almost

324
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,860
one-to-one relationship between the

325
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,659
various chromosomes here showing that

326
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,579
there's been very little chromosomal

327
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,278
rearrangement since this whole genome

328
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:10,979
duplication 100 million years ago uh

329
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,259
this is unheard of in vascular plants uh

330
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,778
there are some cases in mosses and also

331
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,700
in fish where intergenomic Symphony that

332
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,458
is between two genomes has been

333
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,778
preserved for 100 million years or 150

334
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,278
million years

335
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:25,019
um this is the only case I know of in

336
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,000
vascular plants and the only case I know

337
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,860
where this intra genomic Symphony

338
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,700
following a whole genome duplication is

339
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,700
so well preserved

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,259
that being said our homosporous Fern

341
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,519
genome assembly was not the only one

342
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,338
that year

343
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,019
um and so while I would like right to

344
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,579
extrapolate my result to all

345
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,320
hemosphorous plants or at least all

346
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,299
hamasporous ferns uh there are two

347
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
problems with that and their serotopters

348
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,019
for charity eye and adiant and capilus

349
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,338
veneris both of these ferns have

350
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,039
experienced whole genome duplications

351
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,660
more recently than alsophilus spinulosa

352
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,639
And yet when we look at the symphony

353
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,159
within their genomes we don't see the

354
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,399
same thing at all they're relatively few

355
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,078
Gene pairs preserved these ferns just

356
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,578
came out these assemblies so I don't

357
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,819
have a great explanation for this yet

358
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,319
but suffice to say that the things that

359
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
are that are regulating the number of

360
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,079
chromosomes right that are driving up

361
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,180
the number of chromosomes in these

362
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,759
phosphorous ferns are not as simple as

363
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,638
reduced recombination or or less

364
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,360
rearrangement during diploidization

365
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,360
foreign

366
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,138
ferns there are also hemosphorous

367
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,778
lycophytes and we had the opportunity to

368
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,459
collaborate with researchers at jgi and

369
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:41,519
also the Chinese Academy Of Agricultural

370
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:43,500
Science uh to do not one but two genome

371
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
assemblies uh in this group The Leica

372
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
podiac

373
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,839
that you might notice I said two genome

374
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,240
assemblies but since we're all experts

375
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,639
at wgd now you recognize these as

376
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,980
Symphony plots and I have three and

377
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:59,039
that's because Preparatory asiatica is a

378
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,139
recent aloe polyploid allopetraploid and

379
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,179
our collaborators at the Chinese Academy

380
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,339
Of Agricultural Science were able to

381
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,739
separate those two sub genomes so that

382
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,019
we could perform analyzes on them uh

383
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,339
separately which was very interesting

384
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,500
for our whole genome duplication

385
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,540
analysis but also much more

386
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,899
computationally efficient currency

387
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:21,659
asiatica has over 100 chromosomes

388
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,778
so again usual battery of tests right

389
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,480
here are KS plots uh we see single peaks

390
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,740
in both of them and then these vertical

391
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,420
lines that weren't in the other ones

392
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,879
just represent the Divergence either

393
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,500
between uh huperzia asiatica and

394
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,500
diphasiastrom conglonautom are two

395
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,839
species here shown in green or each of

396
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,698
them and their closest heterosporous

397
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,100
relative in isoets

398
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:46,620
uh the problem with ks in this group is

399
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,060
that substitution rates are very slow as

400
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,759
a result if you have multiple whole

401
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,859
genome duplications these KS Peaks can

402
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,539
tend to stack up on one another uh

403
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,940
making it very difficult to discern

404
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,679
whether this peak represents one or

405
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,839
multiple duplications

406
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,120
so to get more insight right we turn to

407
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,980
our phylogenetic reconciliation and what

408
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,198
we find in diphaziastrum is in fact a

409
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,480
single duplication uh but in huperzia

410
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,519
asiatica we find two one prior to the

411
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,680
Divergence of the two subgenomes and

412
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,339
another prior to the Divergence of the

413
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,338
entire genus

414
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,419
but again what was exciting here was not

415
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,740
that we identified whole genome

416
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,139
duplications

417
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,240
um lycopodioac is Rife with whole genome

418
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,339
duplication yet another thing that made

419
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,220
placing them using KS particularly

420
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,740
frustrating uh what was exciting

421
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,519
was the symphony

422
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,039
so we have our phylogeny here right with

423
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,639
whole genome duplications marked on it

424
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,519
um

425
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,320
and here we have intergenomic Symphony

426
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,940
plots so these are not within a single

427
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,459
genome they're between two

428
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,380
the first one shows Symphony between the

429
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,958
two sub genomes are prepared to asiatica

430
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,578
these species have urged 33 million

431
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,099
years ago which is certainly not too

432
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:01,078
long for centini to be preserved but if

433
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,639
you look at the representation of

434
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,379
symphony between these two so each of

435
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,320
these black dots is not just a gene pair

436
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:09,360
that's a block of co-linear genes uh you

437
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,980
see that it's almost perfectly preserved

438
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,800
across both of these genomes they're

439
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,800
almost identical in gene order uh which

440
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,899
is incredible after 33 million years

441
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,419
but what's really incredible is when we

442
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,399
compare these two species uh so if

443
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,799
herzia asiatica and dipasiastrum

444
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,799
complanatum are as divergent as two

445
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,679
lycopodioac species can be with our best

446
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,379
guess putting them at about 400 million

447
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,239
years diverged they've both experienced

448
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,179
independent whole genome duplications in

449
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,159
that time and despite that we see large

450
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:43,198
proportions of the genome represented in

451
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,879
our symphony plot and not only that we

452
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,219
can also identify a two to four

453
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,198
relationship between the chromosomes

454
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,360
that recapitulates our finding from

455
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,258
phylogenetic analysis that we have one

456
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,180
duplication in diphaziastrum for two in

457
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,180
Hubert sciatica Asia or hubercia

458
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:03,539
asiatica

459
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:06,720
so if our findings in alsophila were

460
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:08,759
impressive this is mind-blowing I mean

461
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,519
you know forget about moss forget about

462
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,439
fish uh there there are no other

463
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,259
examples of symphony being preserved

464
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,120
over these kind of time periods uh so

465
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,859
again right it points to this fact that

466
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,198
at least in some homosphorous lineages

467
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,659
the rearrangement of chromosomes

468
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,058
following duplication or even following

469
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,360
speciation is occurring at a very slow

470
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,359
rate

471
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,200
speaking of rates uh before I move on I

472
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,000
briefly want to talk about substitution

473
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,919
rates in these two groups because it's

474
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,619
another thing that unites them so

475
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,720
sciately have previously been shown to

476
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,719
have low substitution rates using

477
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,700
chloroplast data compared to other firms

478
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,740
and our study used nuclear data right

479
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,840
for both of these genomic data and found

480
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,660
that they had lower substitution rates

481
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,240
in the lycopodiace relative to all of

482
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,519
our heterosporous Leica fights

483
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,200
um and then say at thealese relative to

484
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,579
all other Ferns homosporous and

485
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
heterosporous

486
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:05,939
now while I don't think that this is

487
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,480
directly linked that is to say causative

488
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,820
right uh with with our reduced rates of

489
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,620
rearrangement it's another interesting

490
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,298
correlation that we have between these

491
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:17,279
two groups uh compared to other

492
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:20,960
heterosporous lineages and even other

493
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,960
Hamas bris lineages of burns

494
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,400
all right on to my favorite plants uh

495
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,360
we're gonna talk about ice Wheaties for

496
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,640
a little while and we're going to shift

497
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,918
gears uh not talk about whole genome

498
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,299
duplication and talk a little bit about

499
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,980
cam photosynthesis instead

500
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:41,220
are just an incredible group of plants

501
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,319
uh they're very diminutive right easy to

502
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,360
overlook but they're thought to be the

503
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,339
closest living relatives of these giant

504
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,379
tree-like plants that used to dominate

505
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,879
the Carboniferous flora and in fact make

506
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,860
up the majority of the coal that we burn

507
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,100
today

508
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:58,740
uh despite being again much smaller than

509
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,839
their relatives uh they have a worldwide

510
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,480
distribution they're very diverse they

511
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,639
occupy a wide range of both Aquatic and

512
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,440
terrestrial habitats

513
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,419
um and and they're part of a long

514
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,240
unbranching lineage right that diverged

515
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:15,020
from all other vascular plants over 350

516
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,019
million years ago

517
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,279
so we sequence is genome this is

518
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,259
actually the first genomic analysis I

519
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,399
did when I got to Cornell uh but I'm

520
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,558
really not going to spend any time

521
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,298
talking about it uh this will come up

522
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,700
again later we did do our whole genome

523
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,619
duplication analysis and while Symphony

524
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,840
was not particularly informative in this

525
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:36,479
group we did find evidence for one

526
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,399
duplication uh in its history from a

527
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,058
combination of KS and phylogenetic

528
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,059
reconciliation

529
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,240
but what's really neat about ISO

530
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,099
Wheaties uh is that it does Cam

531
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,538
photosynthesis if you've heard about cam

532
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,579
before it has almost certainly been in

533
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:53,099
the context of dry adapted plants like

534
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,099
this Cactus or this Agave that do it to

535
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:59,339
conserve water right so essentially uh

536
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:00,779
in dry adapted plants cam allows them to

537
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:02,819
close their stomata during the hottest

538
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,619
part of the day to reduce transpiration

539
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:06,899
of the environment they then open their

540
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:09,359
stomata at night take up carbon dioxide

541
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,980
uh fix that carbon dioxide and store it

542
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,019
as malate and then it's released during

543
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,700
the day to conduct photosynthesis while

544
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,038
the stomata are closed

545
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,440
ISO eates does Cam photosynthesis when

546
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,000
it's completely submerged so it's

547
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
clearly not doing this to conserve water

548
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,740
why is it doing can uh we got some

549
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,419
interesting information on this from my

550
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,179
colleague Jacob suisa who published a

551
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,700
paper uh where they did CO2 starvation

552
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,620
experiments that show that isoetis is

553
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,960
doing ham most likely because of the

554
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,939
limited availability of CO2 in the water

555
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,679
carbon dioxide diffuses through water

556
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,360
very poorly and during the day it's used

557
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,000
up very quickly by algae and other

558
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,819
aquatic plants in the water column so as

559
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,400
an adaptation to this isoedes absorbs as

560
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,659
much CO2 as it can at night through its

561
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
roots in fact

562
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,759
and then during the day right it

563
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,038
releases the melee from the vacuole it

564
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,798
liberates the CO2 and fixes that carbon

565
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,058
into sugar

566
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,679
and one of the first things we found

567
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,319
when we compared gene expression and

568
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,940
isoedes to these terrestrial plants uh

569
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,058
not these terrestrial plants but

570
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,038
pineapple calanchoe and sedum uh is that

571
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:16,619
gene expression both the genes that are

572
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,019
differentially expressed and the manner

573
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,239
in which they're expressed is very

574
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:24,119
similar almost identical in many cases

575
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,380
and this was interesting if for no other

576
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,079
reason because there's actually been

577
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,360
some pushback in calling this can right

578
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,359
can is an adaptation to dry environments

579
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,639
uh and and so this really shows that at

580
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,558
least from a genetic perspective there's

581
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,120
really no difference between what these

582
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,019
plants are doing and what these plants

583
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,418
are doing

584
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,220
uh there were some differences between

585
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,200
aquatic plants and terrestrial plants

586
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,460
again for the sake of time I'm really

587
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,019
just going to focus on the one that I

588
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,740
think is the coolest

589
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,480
uh so this is Pepsi well this is Pepsi

590
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,700
too but Pepsi is the enzyme that

591
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,099
carboxylates or that does the first

592
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,360
carboxylation reaction uh in the cam

593
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:04,619
pathway

594
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:06,298
Pepsi is a pretty diverse Gene family uh

595
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,599
it can be broadly divided into two

596
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:10,918
groups there's plant type Pepsi and this

597
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,899
is the one that most people talk about

598
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,240
in reference to can so one that's

599
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,740
generally been co-opted for that first

600
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,079
carboxylation step and then there's

601
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,599
bacterial type Pepsi which is a little

602
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,220
bit more obscure uh often lowly

603
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,459
expressed if at all in photosynthetic

604
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,200
tissues so imagine my surprise when uh I

605
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,240
looked at which copy was expressed in

606
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,740
isoedes and first of all found not one

607
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,140
but two copies that were highly

608
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,460
expressed and then found that the most

609
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,799
highly expressed it's actually this

610
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,079
bacterial type Pepsi

611
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,700
so there is one place right where

612
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,960
bacterial type Pepsi is known to be

613
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,319
highly expressed and that's in the

614
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,880
developing seeds of the castor oil plant

615
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:51,178
and there it's found to form a

616
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,400
heteroctomer with plant type Pepsi and

617
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,620
is found to be much less sensitive to

618
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,000
inhibition by melee which accumulates in

619
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:58,918
large quantities in these castor oil

620
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,659
seeds as they're developing

621
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,159
there's another place we know of Right

622
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,480
Where melee accumulates in large

623
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,640
quantities and that's in the leaves of

624
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,679
these Pam plants so while I have no

625
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,419
evidence to support this

626
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,860
um I think it's a really exciting story

627
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,380
right and something that certainly

628
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,779
merits following up on uh that it's very

629
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,000
possible that ISO eates that expresses

630
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,859
both of these copies of Pepsi right with

631
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,859
relatively uh similar expression

632
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,658
patterns in the leaves might also do

633
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,339
this as an adaptation to the increased

634
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,960
amount of melee of melee in the leaves

635
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,240
allowing them to fix a little bit more

636
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,419
CO2 at night and be inhibited a little

637
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,419
less

638
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:38,220
all right on to my last chapter still

639
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,659
ISO eates but we're going to talk a

640
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,940
little bit about the recurrent formation

641
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,220
of allopolyploid lineages and I

642
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,679
sweetie's Appalachian

643
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,819
so while cam is really cool it is not

644
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,640
actually the first thing that attracted

645
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,558
me to ISO eats uh ice Suite is known for

646
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,559
its really high propensity to form

647
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,359
hybrids and also polyploids

648
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,220
um in fact researchers have found if you

649
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,779
put basically any two diploid species of

650
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,240
isotheses together they will form

651
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:05,460
hybrids the problem is those diploid

652
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,538
hybrids are sterile basically across the

653
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,140
board

654
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,839
um

655
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,340
that being said they can duplicate their

656
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,019
entire genome right whole genome

657
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,178
duplication which restores fertility

658
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,579
allowing them to form these really

659
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,038
prolific populations like these two of

660
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,058
isolated appalachiana polyploid that

661
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,779
we're going to get to know in just a

662
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,700
minute

663
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:26,158
so this depicts the reticulate

664
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,960
relationships between ice sweetie

665
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
zingomania is the hybrid relationships

666
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,340
uh one species one North American

667
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,679
species and a few other species in North

668
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:37,259
America and as you can see it's it's

669
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,240
wild all of these species in green are

670
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,579
various hybrids and the polyploid

671
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,960
hybrids are represented by shapes uh

672
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,480
with different numbers of sides right

673
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,840
six sides is hexaploid three sides is

674
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,220
triploid Etc uh and this proclivity

675
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,019
right for hybridization and

676
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,120
polypolidization makes this a great

677
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:57,259
system to study the recurrent formation

678
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,259
of polypoids

679
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,740
uh one last thing before I talk about

680
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,039
ice speed is appalachiana

681
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,298
uh is throughout the study of polyploids

682
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,279
throughout the history of the study of

683
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,379
polyploids various people have referred

684
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,720
to them as dead X

685
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,640
um most recently in 2011 and 2012 a

686
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,100
series of papers came out that

687
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,780
identified a lower diversification rates

688
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:21,959
and higher rates of Extinction in

689
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:23,819
polypoids and this also sort of makes

690
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,319
sense based on what we see in ISO eats

691
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,359
right I said that this would come back

692
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,460
later we find evidence for one whole

693
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,379
genome duplication uh in this whole

694
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,940
history of iso eats and mind you we

695
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,740
could have more sampling right if we had

696
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,360
more species we might find more along

697
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,140
other branches

698
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,740
um

699
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,840
but this doesn't really work right with

700
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,940
what we know about the fact that in fact

701
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,099
more than half or around half of the

702
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,840
species in ISO Wheaties are polyploid so

703
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,879
why are there so many polyploids now but

704
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,158
so few relatively few in The

705
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,980
evolutionary records uh and it comes

706
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,960
back to this idea that perhaps

707
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,940
polyploids form all the time right but

708
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,440
don't actually live that long and if

709
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,778
that that's the case it has important

710
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,640
implications not just for evolution uh

711
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:08,038
but also for conservation many

712
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,020
polyploids are rare uh in fact a lot of

713
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:12,419
them are even federally listed species

714
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:16,859
right but if they don't live that long

715
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,419
if they don't uh say you know admix with

716
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:20,939
other populations if they're relatively

717
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,620
isolated and short-lived maybe that

718
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,460
effort would be better spent on the

719
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,459
diploid species

720
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,359
so to answer this and some other basic

721
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,460
questions sort of about polyploid

722
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,379
speciation in ISO eates I turned this

723
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,000
group I sweetie's Appalachian I picked

724
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,039
it for a couple reasons uh it has a very

725
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,380
large distribution its parentage is

726
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:41,879
already known uh I've gotten a lot of

727
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,260
mileage out of this poster that Peter

728
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,380
made like I don't know how many years

729
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:49,140
ago uh but postdoc in our lab Peter

730
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,360
previously found that it's the product

731
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,940
of at least two separate hybridization

732
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,099
events uh between icewear's angle manii

733
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,080
and Ice Wheaties validate

734
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:00,538
uh This was done though with low copy

735
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,879
nuclear genes I wanted to leverage uh

736
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,220
rad seek next-gen C could sing a whole

737
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,700
genome skimming to take a more in-depth

738
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,679
look uh using more populations at how

739
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,500
frequently these lineages formed uh

740
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,179
whether or not lineages can form uh with

741
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,079
either diploid parent as the maternal

742
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,820
parent

743
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:22,158
and whether or not we see any evidence

744
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,158
of gene flow uh within these species

745
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,839
so I once again got to do a lot of field

746
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,340
work uh I conduct field work all the way

747
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,678
from upstate New York down to Northern

748
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,000
Georgia on this map tetraploids I

749
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,419
collected are represented by Green

750
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,278
squares uh inglemaniae is represented by

751
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,500
Blue circles and is valida is

752
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,240
represented by yellow circles those are

753
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
colors I'll try to stick to for the next

754
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,120
few slides that I think there's at least

755
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,440
one exception

756
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,019
um and finding I sweeties in the field

757
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,140
is sort of like playing where's Waldo in

758
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:54,119
a sea of Walters so there are like five

759
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,159
or six different plant species and this

760
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,379
little Clump in this Lake one of them is

761
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,360
ISO Wheaties uh feel free to tell me

762
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,278
which one

763
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,139
uh so I collected lots of plants I sent

764
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:05,460
them off for DD rad seek which basically

765
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,159
consisted of me just weighing plant

766
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,720
material into a plastic tube uh but I

767
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,059
also did genome skimming for which I got

768
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,519
a little bit of wet lab uh some DNA

769
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:18,240
extraction and Library prep uh for which

770
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,460
I was awarded a graduate fellowship at

771
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,380
the Smithsonian I worked with Liz Zimmer

772
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,460
and did all of this wet lab under the

773
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,500
expert guidance of her Tech Gabe Johnson

774
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,200
and as a wonderful and enjoyable

775
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,460
experience uh great to finally do some

776
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,080
wet lab

777
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,480
before I could do anything with that

778
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,220
data I had some work to do working with

779
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,960
aloe polyploids is difficult because

780
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,000
essentially you're looking at a genome

781
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,159
that contains two Divergent genomes with

782
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,480
different evolutionary histories which

783
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,720
makes things like phylogenetic and

784
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,000
population genetic analysis difficult

785
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,940
so I used a somewhat unorthodox approach

786
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,640
that I adapted from a bum barely at all

787
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,620
paper on soybean uh creating a

788
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,840
pseudo-reference using my diploid rad

789
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,819
seek data I did that by mapping it first

790
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,980
to a reference assembly from I sweetie

791
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,798
single manii I pulled out regions where

792
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,019
both diploid parents mapped and then I

793
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,639
took those mapped reads and created my

794
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,200
pseudo-reference assembly

795
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,600
then I took that pseudo-reference

796
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,640
assembly and mapped my polypoid reads to

797
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,500
and reads that map differentially to one

798
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,080
parent or the other were then retained

799
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,579
her Downstream analysis and treated

800
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,000
basically as separate diploid

801
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,000
populations

802
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,538
the first analysis I did was a principal

803
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,860
components analysis and this was

804
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:34,379
basically just to make sure that my

805
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,319
phasing approach sort of worked and it

806
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,419
appears to have so we see that the

807
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,298
Appalachian eloci in green and yellow

808
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,778
tend to Cluster uh with their diploid

809
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:47,579
parent like I would expect them to uh so

810
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:49,440
following this I also constructed a

811
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,199
phylogeny to look for evidence of

812
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,759
recurrent formation of these lineages uh

813
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,759
and basically you know I'm just doing

814
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,278
this by counting monophyletic claims of

815
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,140
is appalachiana that are separated from

816
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,778
their diploid relatives and looking at

817
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,880
this tree we can easily infer uh four

818
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:07,558
different formation events that led to

819
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,899
the current distribution of iso eats

820
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,398
appalachiana uh sorry I meant to Mark

821
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:14,778
these with asterisks or something it's a

822
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:14,778
little hard to look at I acknowledge

823
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,639
uh surprisingly despite this recurrent

824
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,980
formation of icd's appalachiana in every

825
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,620
single case from our chloroplast tree

826
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,140
right we see that ICD single maniai is

827
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,278
the maternal parent uh and I say this is

828
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,620
surprising because there is evidence

829
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,380
that at least between species of equal

830
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:36,178
ploidy uh that either parent is equally

831
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,520
likely uh to be the maternal versus

832
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,380
paternal parent uh that being said in

833
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,859
species of differing employee uh

834
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,020
differences in sizes of the sperm means

835
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:47,398
that polyploid sperm cannot fit through

836
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,519
the archegonial neck cells of the

837
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,859
diploid so in crosses between polyploids

838
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,658
and diploids we basically always see

839
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:57,298
that the polyploid is the maternal

840
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,039
parent uh while these are both diploids

841
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:00,298
it's possible that there are differences

842
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,220
right in the anatomy of these

843
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,619
archegonial neck cells or in the size of

844
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,179
their sperm uh similarly another study

845
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:07,678
found that the formation of these

846
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,899
archegonia can vary widely between

847
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,360
species unfortunately the study did not

848
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:14,339
include isoedes valida but it did find

849
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,678
that ice angle maniai is particularly

850
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:19,798
prolific and good at forming these are

851
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,659
begonia so it's possible right that I

852
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,339
specifically Mania just forms a lot more

853
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:25,380
archegonia than I sweetie's valida so

854
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,359
I'm less likely to sample polyploids

855
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,220
that were formed in the the opposite

856
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,740
direction

857
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,419
another sort of surprising result uh is

858
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,220
that we found no evidence for isolation

859
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,140
by distance and what I mean by this is

860
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,240
that as populations get more

861
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,480
geographically distant we do not tend to

862
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,819
also get more genetically dist

863
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,919
and this is counterintuitive at first uh

864
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,599
because we expect icevds to be very

865
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,580
dispersal limited right it can only

866
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:52,619
disperse passively through the water or

867
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,879
occasionally uh maybe conduct long

868
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,178
distance dispersal on migrating

869
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,320
waterfowl uh but I I honestly expected

870
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,460
there to be quite a bit of structure

871
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,538
here

872
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,100
um

873
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:03,740
I have an explanation for this though

874
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:06,658
and I think it's a relatively simple one

875
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,000
uh I think that for something like ISO

876
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,799
eats that is so dispersal limited one

877
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,140
mile is basically as good as a hundred

878
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:16,079
it's as likely to disperse to that pond

879
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,740
one County over uh as it is to you know

880
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,119
ride on a goose uh two states over and

881
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,339
as a result we see this pretty flat

882
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,019
distribution uh where we have very

883
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:26,759
distant populations that are relatively

884
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,778
similar but also populations that are

885
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,079
very close together that are very

886
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:30,079
distant

887
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,539
all right the last analysis I'm going to

888
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,798
talk about today uh is my admixture

889
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:40,619
analysis and this is to look for

890
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,898
evidence of gene flow Within These uh

891
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,398
species of iso eates either between the

892
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:46,379
diploid or sorry within the diploids

893
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,178
within the polyploids or possibly

894
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,760
between them

895
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,559
um so this first plot is called an

896
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,019
admixture plot and without going into

897
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,639
too much detail because I think well not

898
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:57,480
that low on time

899
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
um

900
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,720
we're not going into too much detail

901
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,759
essentially you you assign it a fixed

902
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,740
number of populations in this case nine

903
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,819
uh in this case you arrive at that

904
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,460
number using something called a cross

905
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:10,500
entropy plot but you can also use like

906
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,840
biologically informative numbers right

907
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,398
if you sampled from 20 populations say

908
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,500
you could try to assign these to 20

909
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,418
ancestral populations

910
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,859
um in this case we went with the one

911
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,740
that was identified by cross entropy

912
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,898
which was nine and

913
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,099
what it does is it tries to assign each

914
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:28,739
of these individuals between an

915
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,119
ancestral population but can also assign

916
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,740
a single individual to multiple

917
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,719
ancestral populations right which we

918
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,819
might infer as evidence of admixture

919
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,500
either in the past or ongoing

920
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:40,079
we can see that a nice sweetie single

921
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,659
maniai almost all of these blocks are a

922
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,339
solid color uh there are kind of these

923
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,260
multi-colored tails at the bottoms of

924
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,119
them but those are mostly associated

925
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,339
with missing data as missing data

926
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,558
increases those little Rainbow tails on

927
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:54,599
the ends of them get longer

928
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,178
um we do see at least one instance from

929
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,579
admixture plots that appears to show

930
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:03,480
gene flow between these individuals in

931
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:05,339
DW 86 and 111 and these polyploid

932
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,079
individuals at the end now the issue

933
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:09,539
with this is that these are diploids and

934
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,179
these are polyploids so I don't expect

935
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:15,418
this to be evidence of ongoing gene flow

936
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,480
um instead would I interpret this as is

937
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:20,819
historic gene flow between the diploid

938
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,440
progenitors of those polyploids and

939
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,179
perhaps the diploid ancestors of these

940
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,918
diploids

941
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,119
the other analysis that we use one of

942
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,398
the other analyzes that we used again

943
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,399
I'm not talking about it all today

944
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,259
um are are these reticulate phylogenies

945
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,299
uh made in a program called splits tree

946
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,800
and we make these because well all the

947
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,419
trees I've shown you today have been

948
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,280
these sort of branching bifurcating

949
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,319
trees that's not really how Evolution

950
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,320
works right particularly within species

951
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,659
we expect there to be lots of gene flow

952
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,159
between different populations we expect

953
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,200
these things to be able to reproduce

954
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,179
with one another and as a result those

955
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,918
branches on that neatly bifurcating tree

956
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,900
would have lines drawn between them

957
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,000
right showing evidence of that gene flow

958
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,420
and that's all this is

959
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,280
um so here we do see right these diploid

960
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,900
individuals kind of come out on a branch

961
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,300
and might show some reticulation with

962
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,880
those polyploids but another thing that

963
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,940
we see is these despite not showing any

964
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,019
evidence of admixture in our bar plot

965
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,179
these individuals here which are all

966
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:20,219
polyploids from central Pennsylvania and

967
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:22,019
Northern Maryland uh show a high degree

968
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,059
of admixture and I'm pointing that out

969
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,800
because it's also something that we're

970
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:27,599
going to see on future plots

971
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,820
uh one last thing I want to mention

972
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,800
before I move on uh are these large

973
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,180
blocks of color we see so these large

974
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,280
blocks of color actually comprise

975
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:38,460
multiple sites that I sampled uh some of

976
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,500
which span multiple watersheds so while

977
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,940
once again this could be evidence of

978
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,039
ongoing ad mixture between these

979
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,139
populations the distances are large

980
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:47,579
enough uh that I would also argue this

981
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,980
could just be example of recent

982
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,720
dispersal of a single ancestral

983
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,300
population right so this could just

984
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,098
represent multiple dispersal events

985
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,940
um of a single population as opposed to

986
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,940
ongoing gene flow

987
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,619
so this is the same analysis shown for

988
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,380
ice sweetie's valida has even more taxes

989
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,800
so even harder to read but

990
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,079
uh if you just look at the colors

991
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,400
we see a lot more evidence of admixture

992
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,780
it's still very limited right for the

993
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,660
most part this is still a plot dominated

994
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,519
by large single blocks of color

995
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,618
um and and each of these blocks

996
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,719
typically represents a single site or a

997
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:27,059
single watershed

998
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,419
um but we have a few exceptions uh first

999
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,460
of all we still see these polyploid uh

1000
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,980
accessions from central Pennsylvania and

1001
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,500
Northern Maryland clustering together uh

1002
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,119
again I can't say definitively whether

1003
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,239
or not there's admixture going on just

1004
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,519
from this data uh but it seems like the

1005
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,279
most likely example of of gene flow

1006
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:50,219
between polyploid populations but we do

1007
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,359
see one really excellent example of gene

1008
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:56,578
flow uh between two diploid populations

1009
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,380
so this involves these samples dw90

1010
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:01,079
these are from

1011
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,838
the cheat River in West Virginia

1012
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,359
and I sampled six individuals from this

1013
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,699
population uh two of them come out in

1014
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,920
this large group that again does span

1015
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:14,578
multiple watersheds two of them come out

1016
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,579
in this very small group uh with another

1017
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:21,480
site from a river located sorry a creek

1018
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,760
located nearby and then two of them show

1019
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,639
a mixed ancestry between the two almost

1020
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,859
perfectly mixed 50 50. so I would argue

1021
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,980
right that this is really good evidence

1022
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:34,440
of of one instance where we see active

1023
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,240
admixture and gene flow going on between

1024
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,539
two different populations in the cheap

1025
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,539
River

1026
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,280
all right this is my only big long text

1027
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,780
slide in here

1028
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,560
um inclusion

1029
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,540
uh we see that polyploids form very

1030
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,159
frequently right in this group uh

1031
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,440
despite that we don't see any evidence

1032
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,598
of reciprocal formation

1033
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,179
um ice sweeties appears to be severely

1034
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,220
limited by dispersal but just based on

1035
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:03,838
those admixture plots right we see that

1036
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,578
there is evidence of some kind of

1037
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,759
long-range dispersal at least

1038
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,039
infrequently

1039
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,619
uh despite that capacity for long range

1040
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,320
dispersal admixture seems rare we don't

1041
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,660
have any really concrete cases where we

1042
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,280
can absolutely say right that this is an

1043
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,679
example of ongoing admixture between

1044
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,140
these populations except for that one

1045
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,019
example from my sweetie's valida

1046
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,159
so what does this all mean right going

1047
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,099
back to what I said earlier about

1048
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:34,799
conservation it seems to support this

1049
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,140
idea that despite polyploids forming

1050
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,960
very frequently uh we see them being

1051
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,000
successful pretty rarely and if that's

1052
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,159
true I think that

1053
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,619
this right the fact that they form

1054
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,179
frequently that these polyploids are

1055
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,579
important members of the ecosystems

1056
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:52,980
where they're found suggests a diploid's

1057
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,900
first approach by which I don't mean we

1058
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,179
should forget about the polyploids I

1059
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,400
mean that preserving the processes that

1060
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,019
recurrently generate the polyploids is

1061
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,000
more important than preserving one

1062
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:05,400
population or another per se

1063
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,260
uh and that by conserving those

1064
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,700
processes right we increase the chance

1065
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,920
that

1066
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:12,539
some polyploid lineages might eventually

1067
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,099
be successful

1068
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:15,599
um that if those polyploid lineages

1069
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,480
serve an important role in their

1070
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,359
community that they'll continue to exist

1071
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,000
uh without perhaps wasting resources

1072
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:27,500
focusing on on small or or narrowly

1073
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,500
distributed polyploid lineages

1074
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,460
with that I have a lot of people to

1075
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,019
acknowledge uh first of all my

1076
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,240
collaborators both at the Chinese

1077
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,699
Academy Of Agricultural Science uh at

1078
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,459
Chinese Academy of Forestry at jgi and

1079
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:42,659
the Salk Institute for all of their help

1080
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,358
assembling these genomes and with

1081
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:47,460
Downstream analyzes we did everybody at

1082
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,159
bti in the Lee lab who's helped out a

1083
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,039
lot uh the people at the Smithsonian for

1084
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,199
teaching me how to do wet lab uh Jacob

1085
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,599
for letting me just drop into his office

1086
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:00,118
basically anytime and ask him ridiculous

1087
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,380
questions about bioinformatics

1088
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,700
um the other Jacob for letting me ask

1089
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,099
him ridiculous questions about ice

1090
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:07,078
sweeties Peter too

1091
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,119
uh and there are a lot of other people I

1092
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,800
need to thank uh acknowledgments isn't

1093
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,660
even a strong enough word so I made

1094
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,500
another slide

1095
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:19,139
um I cannot thank Layla enough she's put

1096
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,358
up with so much uh she's listened to us

1097
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:23,338
ramble about plant Evolution non-stop

1098
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,199
she's put up with me being stressed and

1099
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,699
late nights and early mornings and I'm

1100
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,319
so grateful and couldn't have done any

1101
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,960
of this without her

1102
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,000
uh my family I literally would not be

1103
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,099
here without them uh they came all the

1104
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,800
way here from Kansas to see me give this

1105
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,780
presentation also Layla's family who

1106
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,060
came all the way from Pennsauken despite

1107
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,500
probably understanding very little of

1108
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,019
this

1109
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,139
very kind of you and all the lovely

1110
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:48,139
people

1111
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,098
that you supported me through a pandemic

1112
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,380
uh you got me through a dissertation I

1113
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,180
couldn't be more grateful uh thank you

1114
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,400
so much and I'm happy to take any

1115
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:02,838
questions

1116
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,838
hurry excellent

1117
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:10,679
on conservation when it comes to plants

1118
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,079
like just doubling their genomes do they

1119
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,358
can you tell from the outside very

1120
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,000
easily in terms of like if you took a

1121
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,039
behaviorist approach in terms of them

1122
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,139
fitting into this larger like ecological

1123
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:22,920
niche do the diplines just do the same

1124
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:25,078
stuff

1125
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,358
that's a great question and one that I

1126
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,400
actually uh had intended to address more

1127
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,719
directly with this uh this project kind

1128
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,579
of got pushed off and off and off

1129
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,259
because of the pandemic

1130
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,519
um but absolutely and I think an

1131
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,240
important component of this analysis

1132
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,338
that I didn't do is is looking at uh the

1133
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:44,159
niches that the polyploids Occupy versus

1134
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:46,199
the diploids uh in other species right

1135
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:49,379
there's evidence that diploids really

1136
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,879
are just filling in space left behind uh

1137
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,280
sorry polyploids are just filling in

1138
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,900
space left behind by the diploids

1139
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,579
um but there are also other studies that

1140
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,200
show that polypodes are capable of kind

1141
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,359
of inhabiting these new environments

1142
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,699
right spreading to higher elevations or

1143
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:05,159
higher latitudes uh in which case they

1144
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:08,039
would be important as far as if you can

1145
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:12,299
just you know tell them apart generally

1146
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:15,000
in ISO 80s not really uh in other plants

1147
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,440
to varying degrees uh uh right so most

1148
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,059
of what I'm talking about here is aloe

1149
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,820
polyplitty which also involves

1150
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:23,400
hybridization and those hybrids can be

1151
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,039
easier to determine from their polyploid

1152
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,260
relatives uh than the other case which

1153
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,719
is just duplication uh of a single

1154
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,339
genome or Auto

1155
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,439
um but yeah I think that's an important

1156
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:37,019
part of this project that I would like

1157
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,940
to do eventually uh and and I think

1158
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:41,159
would give us a lot more insight into

1159
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:43,139
the conservation implications of

1160
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,739
preserving one or the other and I have

1161
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,819
another

1162
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,819
go ahead

1163
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,859
so many humans like try some of their

1164
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:54,480
disease

1165
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:57,920
um most of the time

1166
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,139
plans apparently double their genome

1167
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,059
yeah why is that like do they just

1168
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:06,299
suppress the hell out of their genomes

1169
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:08,519
when they do that or uh I mean as to the

1170
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,280
difference in animals I'm not sure how

1171
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,739
well I can comment um but

1172
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,500
uh in Plants I mean there are a lot of

1173
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,299
immediate consequences of of polyploidy

1174
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,500
in a lot of cases so some of the things

1175
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,539
that I mentioned right like a

1176
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,940
multi-somic inheritance

1177
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:27,539
um bad pairing of chromosomes at meiosis

1178
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,760
can in fact have deleterious uh effects

1179
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,980
on some of these polyploid lineages

1180
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,500
um gene silencing is a big part of it

1181
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,420
again allopolyploids tend to be more

1182
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,480
successful so I think that that plant's

1183
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,519
ability uh to be so promiscuous and

1184
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,260
produce so many hybrids is also helpful

1185
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,940
because those aloe polyploids have less

1186
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,440
problems with chromosome pairing at

1187
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,500
meiosis

1188
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,720
um and yeah I think in ferns certainly

1189
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,539
uh it's been shown that sort of the

1190
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:57,059
immediate silencing of a lot of genes uh

1191
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,440
is very important to polyploids

1192
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:02,719
immediately following that whole genome

1193
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,720
duplication great thank you structure

1194
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:09,179
yes fantastic talk really interesting

1195
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,180
multi-disciplinary approach

1196
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:14,460
um so in the tree Ferns and the

1197
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:15,559
al-sophilas you know so you found High

1198
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,179
Symphony

1199
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,059
uh but listen to me in two other

1200
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:22,919
homosphorus ferns yes do you think one

1201
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:25,159
explanation could be the life history

1202
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,780
the fact that these are long-lived

1203
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:29,460
definitely I mean and that's and that is

1204
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,859
something that we suggest in the paper

1205
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,260
so the original study that used

1206
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:36,358
chloroplast data and found those reduced

1207
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,760
substitution rates in sciately suggested

1208
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:41,159
that it was linked not only to

1209
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,300
generation time but to arborescence per

1210
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,039
se

1211
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,380
um and there have been other studies in

1212
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,000
angiosperms that find the substitution

1213
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,338
rate is correlated to things like plant

1214
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,739
height I mean not just to the generation

1215
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:54,480
time of these plants so I definitely

1216
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:56,578
think that that life history is at play

1217
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,719
certainly in the substitution rates and

1218
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,818
again well I don't think there's

1219
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,459
necessarily a direct link between them

1220
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:04,858
also possibly uh in the Centennial being

1221
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,740
preserved time

1222
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:09,659
yeah not related to that question it got

1223
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,639
me thinking about the same thing uh the

1224
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:13,858
old-fashioned idea of adaptive Gene

1225
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:16,618
complexes like why are these genes

1226
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:18,598
hanging together versus not because in a

1227
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,599
lot of cases right a hybridization for

1228
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,940
example breaks apart adaptive complex so

1229
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,700
I'm wondering in these arborists uh

1230
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:29,338
Ferns and what's different about being

1231
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:32,759
sort of quote Woody right being like a

1232
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:36,119
tree versus being a more herbaceous type

1233
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,980
firm so uh yeah I mean and it's possible

1234
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:39,900
it has something to do with it I I don't

1235
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,539
know enough about the difference in in

1236
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,338
gene expression between say the Woody

1237
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:46,619
ferns versus the more herbaceous ones

1238
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:47,219
that being said

1239
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,619
um

1240
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:52,799
we did see we did analyze gene

1241
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,599
expression uh in Alpha espinolosa and

1242
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,180
one of the things that was interesting

1243
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,680
is we didn't necessarily

1244
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,699
when we saw genes that were located on

1245
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:01,980
two different chromosomes we didn't

1246
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:03,659
necessarily see any kind of bias which I

1247
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,880
think is unusual in polypoids I think

1248
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:09,179
typically in polyploids both ancient and

1249
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,760
recent you do see a bias very early on

1250
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:12,899
that then sort of persists between genes

1251
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,700
that are either along the same

1252
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,099
chromosome or originate from the same

1253
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:20,539
genome uh and and we don't see that in

1254
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:20,539
al-sophila which is unusual

1255
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:27,679
yeah it was a question of course we'll

1256
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,679
see

1257
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:36,719
100 million years 200 million years

1258
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:39,000
so those calibrations actually are

1259
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:44,759
secondary calibrations uh that we took

1260
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,318
from a paper uh by West hesto at all

1261
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,119
um and

1262
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,338
to be fair most of their calibrations

1263
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,019
were much deeper in the tree they had

1264
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:55,858
very few calibrations that were actually

1265
00:46:52,019 --> 00:47:00,119
in uh the Leica podiac

1266
00:46:55,858 --> 00:47:01,858
um but it's by far the most fossil

1267
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,858
calibrations that have been used in like

1268
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:08,219
fight tree uh and and they were able to

1269
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:10,739
calibrate the crown age of Leica fights

1270
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:13,019
um and and also I think the crown age of

1271
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:15,479
like a booty AC just not within that

1272
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:18,599
group very much

1273
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,338
um it's definitely debatable uh other

1274
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,680
papers have gotten much younger

1275
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:25,679
estimates for that but most of them had

1276
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,358
had much lower sampling of Leica fights

1277
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,699
um and

1278
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,440
weren't really focused on like a fight

1279
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,480
diversification per se the nice thing

1280
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,659
about the Testo paper is has really good

1281
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,960
species sampling and they tried a lot of

1282
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:41,159
different clock approaches uh using a

1283
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,980
variety of different phylogenetic

1284
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,539
methods uh to kind of try to settle on

1285
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,219
that date but I I agree it's

1286
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:50,358
controversial

1287
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:50,358
um that they're quite that old

1288
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,858
um let's see if I guess that's right

1289
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,140
um physical genomes which is really

1290
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:01,259
awesome

1291
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:03,920
this is a microphone AC you have very

1292
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,819
very low bracelet chromosome

1293
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,680
rearrangements and then you touch on

1294
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:11,460
substitution rates but I didn't quite

1295
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,919
pick up on that is that also low or is

1296
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,720
it kind of comparable to like

1297
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,480
collagenella comparative genomic uh no

1298
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,098
so it's low compared so we did it

1299
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,659
compared to all of the heterosporous

1300
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:23,760
lycophytes together we compared

1301
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:25,679
substitution rates and compared to all

1302
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,119
of them together it's much lower and

1303
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,598
then even when we compare independently

1304
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,338
to either solar genella or to isoedes uh

1305
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,838
the lycopodiac are considered have

1306
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:35,940
considerably lower substitution rates

1307
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:39,179
though

1308
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,338
the same paper uh by Testo at all looked

1309
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:44,098
at substitution rates and it does vary a

1310
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,960
fair amount within the Leica podiac

1311
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,579
um might have noticed that in that tree

1312
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,780
there were a couple branches that were a

1313
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,119
lot longer than the others in the

1314
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,040
lycopody AC and I I think that's

1315
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,900
evidence of the fact there are a couple

1316
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,300
of groups within like a podiac that do

1317
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,920
seem to have accelerated rates of

1318
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,839
substitution relative to the others but

1319
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,800
as a whole they seem much lower and it

1320
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,480
would be really interesting to look at

1321
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:08,640
the genomes in those plates yeah

1322
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:11,639
forgive me if it was like said and I

1323
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,139
instead I thank you also for one what a

1324
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:15,618
wonderful talk

1325
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,480
um and congratulations thanks thanks

1326
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:21,059
okay my question I'm sorry it's so basic

1327
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,119
but I don't understand the basis for the

1328
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:26,159
hypothesis that a hamasporous uh Fern

1329
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,579
would have would be expected to have a

1330
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,139
larger uh well yeah would be expected to

1331
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,339
have a larger genome than a

1332
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:34,078
heterosperous I just don't understand

1333
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:37,078
but so

1334
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,260
I mean as to why they would be expected

1335
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,119
to there are a few different theories

1336
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,740
um that have to do with things like

1337
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,760
intercommetophytic selfing right that

1338
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:46,019
maybe they're keeping a lot more

1339
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,180
chromosomes around a lot more

1340
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:49,980
chromosomal material around

1341
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:51,358
um because intermediative hit Excel

1342
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,980
thing is going to render a lot of

1343
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,259
cytomozygous you're going to end up with

1344
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,818
more sort of recessive lethal problems

1345
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,619
and maybe just by keeping more

1346
00:49:56,818 --> 00:50:00,000
chromosomes around right they're saving

1347
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,960
that off

1348
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,739
um

1349
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,240
but I I think that this is sort of

1350
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,639
something that's been Revisited a few

1351
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,779
times uh as to why exactly they'll be

1352
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,639
doing it but the fact of the matter is

1353
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,859
they just have really large chromosomes

1354
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:16,559
I mean everywhere you look across an

1355
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:18,598
phosphorus plants again the their

1356
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,358
genomes are three to four times the size

1357
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,280
of heterosporous uh I think the Y is a

1358
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,940
little more complicated uh and I don't

1359
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,560
have a great answer for it

1360
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,559
all right that's fine almost done

1361
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:41,159
this has been a production of Cornell

1362
