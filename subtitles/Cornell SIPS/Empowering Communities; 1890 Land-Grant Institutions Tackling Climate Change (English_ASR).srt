1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,000
good afternoon my name is Alton Thompson

2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,560
I am the executive director of The

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,359
Association of research directors for

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,358
the 1890 Lang Grant universities and

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,240
it's great to be on the panel with my

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,800
colleagues Raman Shang and Ali farz

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,799
considered in honor of my presentation

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,679
the climate change and environmental

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,119
justice ensuring resilience for

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,200
underserved communities is really based

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:44,000
on a Multistate uh 1890 multi-state

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,280
climate project that both Raman and Ali

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
are members of also I'm having some

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,679
computer issues so Jennifer is gonna

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,719
Advance my slides for me next

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,640
slide this sort of a presentation

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,840
outline briefly uh I'm talking about the

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,239
climate crisis relative to underserved

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,879
communities environmental justice

20
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,000
relative to justice 40 which is a a a PO

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,118
government initiative a little bit about

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,840
the Multistate climate project uh lived

23
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,560
experience which is an important part of

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,200
our project alignment with the National

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,759
Climate Change road map I'll just I'll

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,560
I'll show you that screen just as

27
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,879
reference and context not to go into it

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,840
a little bit about environmental justice

29
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,280
res resil resiliency for underserved

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,159
communities and then some uh Multistate

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,719
findings and then a a call for Action

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,118
I'm not going to go over all the slides

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,359
some of them are just a reference uh but

34
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,478
then we sort of uh move as accordingly

35
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:44,039
next slide

36
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:47,039
Jennifer essentially my uh focus is on

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,118
really uh a thesis and three themes the

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,240
thesis is this Cade this decade is

39
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,759
crucial for understanding climate change

40
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,158
and the climate crisis and the themes

41
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,359
are the importance of science-based

42
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,039
datadriven Agriculture practices and

43
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,359
policies of climate science diversity

44
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,079
equity and inclusion the relevance of

45
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,478
environmental justice to underserved

46
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,359
communities and building resilience and

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,959
underserved communities uh in terms of

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,440
the uh uh climate change in general the

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,199
B the Biden Harris Harris

50
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,359
Administration has described climate

51
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,919
change as an exist exist existential

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,000
threat uh with issues in environmental

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,559
justice agriculture Transportation

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
energy

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,959
uh Economic Development and prosperity

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
as we look at uh terms of being an

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,199
exential threat uh climate change has

58
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,640
quickly became a focus of Congress he

59
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,839
has become a focus of the administration

60
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,719
industry stakeholders as well as

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,560
Academia in terms of uh climate change

62
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:58,280
in general recent severe weather events

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,280
has caused extensive damage globally

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,039
particularly 1923

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,000
for example in

66
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,000
1923 the United States experienced

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,360
almost

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,840
93 billion dollar in weather and and and

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,640
climate disasters the highest on record

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,560
these this these included 17 severe

71
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:25,119
weather and Hell events four flooding

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:28,640
events two tropical Cyclones two tornado

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,000
outbreaks one wirefire one winter storm

74
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,759
uh several major droughts

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,919
uh several heat wavs throughout the

76
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,318
country in Phoenix Arizona the uh July

77
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,479
was the hottest month on record with an

78
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:46,759
average 103 degrees de Valley in Cal in

79
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:52,399
California had our daily average in on

80
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:55,598
July 20 July 16th of of 128 degrees

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,158
there were a record number of tornadoes

82
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,479
in uh

83
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:03,519
2023 uh which cost about $6 billion in

84
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,119
damage uh all this information come from

85
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,920
Noah National Oceanic Atmospheric

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,438
Administration and as as I'm speaking my

87
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,399
home state of North Carolina

88
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,318
particularly western part of the state

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,000
areas of South Carolina and Georgia are

90
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,120
still recovering from Hurricane Helen

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,160
and as we speaking as I'm speaking now

92
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,879
hurricane Milton or will be uh making

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,439
landfall on the Florida coast somewhere

94
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,399
between south of SAR Sarasota and about

95
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:34,319
and by Nightfall so the camp the climate

96
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:38,439
crisis is real these just some examples

97
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,560
of how the effect it is having uh the

98
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,079
climate crisis calls for Urgent large

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,800
scale mitigation and adaption efforts

100
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,519
for future damages and build resilience

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,240
against its unavoid avoidable impacts

102
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,758
again the uh looking particularly focus

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,439
on the second Bull third bullet and the

104
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,000
fourth bullet uh agriculture is really

105
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,719
based on climate change particular egg

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,240
is really need to be based on science

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,960
Bas data driven practices and policies

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,918
that lower such things as greenhouse gas

109
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,719
emissions uh carbon sequestration

110
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,120
resilience in our food Agriculture and

111
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Forest systems against impacts of

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,639
climate change and the focus of this

113
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,439
project is really for the 1890

114
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,639
universities is funded through our

115
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,360
research program addressing a broad

116
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,120
range of climate change and mitigation

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,680
issues in the 1890 region which is

118
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,360
really uh 18 Southern uh 18 Southern and

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,918
border states

120
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,919
next slide

121
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,399
please again uh the bid Administration

122
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,198
again is a focus of identified racial

123
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,279
equity and addressing climate change as

124
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,639
as immediate priorities uh as going

125
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,758
forward also the Justice Ford initiative

126
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,319
and really the Justice Ford initiative

127
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,280
is one of the requirements of executive

128
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,280
order

129
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:01,839
14008 which aims that uh which aims to

130
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,918
deliver 40% of all overall benefits of

131
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,598
federal investments in climate and clean

132
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,478
energy should be uh earmarked towards

133
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,959
disadvantaged communities this really is

134
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,560
a call for Action in terms of racial

135
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,918
equity and addressing climate change is

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,079
really a call for action for the B

137
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:22,359
Administration and I think I again the

138
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,120
uh 191 189 universes are in a unique

139
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,598
position uh to contribute to this to

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,160
these Solutions because we we have the

141
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,079
academic credentials we have the

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,000
academic

143
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:37,120
experience and also uh which I will

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,120
discuss a little later next slide

145
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,799
please The Proposal we working on that

146
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,639
Ali and Ramon are working on is really

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,520
focused on looking at climate impacts

148
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,000
and its consequences on persons in lwi

149
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,120
income underserved and marginalized

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
communities and communities of color

151
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,199
when we first uh developed this project

152
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,160
we did a literature review and there was

153
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,120
a gap in the literature on how climate

154
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,599
change affect of this

155
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,560
clientele uh climate change is Place

156
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,800
based for example in the Florida area

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,879
and Southeast area pretty much prone to

158
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,598
hurricanes in the midwest is mostly uh

159
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,439
tornadoes and windstorms in the west of

160
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,800
course it's earthquakes and uh wifiers

161
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,478
again this is a multi-state

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,918
multidisiplinary

163
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:26,279
proposal and again uh 189 are unique

164
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,279
because we in a a a position because of

165
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,918
our

166
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,279
experience uh for us CL climate change

167
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,878
is not a flavor of the month we've been

168
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,038
working with this audience for over 130

169
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,560
years we have a unique opportunity to uh

170
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,680
employ our current capacity as well

171
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,598
invest in in new capacity as well as as

172
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,400
we go forward in in this

173
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,519
effort also look at bullet two is this

174
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,679
is an integrated project with both

175
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,000
research extension and uh academics next

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,639
slide

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,240
please in terms of this Slide the uh the

178
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,199
lived experience which is a part of this

179
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,360
project

180
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,759
there's a uh David there's a well

181
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,319
written peer viwed article that appeared

182
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,439
in the journal Community engagement and

183
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,840
scholarship it really talks about how

184
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:15,000
the 1890 should be engaged they using

185
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,239
transdisciplinary approaches and uh

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,199
systems approach and also talked about

187
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,720
the lived experience so I'll ref that

188
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,680
that article later the methodology as

189
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,120
part of this uh proposal is looking at

190
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,639
the Liv experience the Liv experience is

191
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,399
essentially a systematic approach to use

192
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,680
to study understand individuals personal

193
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,879
subjective lived experiences and

194
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,120
interpretation for their own lives

195
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,759
methodologist commonly using qualitative

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,480
research or phenomenology to explore how

197
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,240
people perceive make sense of and

198
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,680
narrate their experiences in other words

199
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,680
that is to view the word Through The

200
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,639
Eyes of the stakeholders to understand

201
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,559
that from their perspective this

202
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,439
ethnographic approach involves deep

203
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,958
intensive interviews to engage C

204
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,640
citizens who have experienced

205
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,879
interacting with persons they trust

206
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,559
that's why we're going to work with the

207
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,720
extension service and and Ramon to sort

208
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,000
of identify persons that we need to

209
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,680
participate in this study basic to

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,879
assess the feelings and emotions about

211
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,719
the experience related to climate change

212
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,120
their perceptions of the threats or the

213
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,320
risk that climate change may cause them

214
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,278
and also determining the Readiness of

215
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,360
unserved communities with uncertainty of

216
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,439
climate change again the Liv experience

217
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,759
is important because we've been work

218
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,360
1890s been working with this audience

219
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,240
lowincome limited resource um small

220
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,639
producers and communities of color for

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,639
over 130 years and the 189 extension

222
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:44,039
program is well equipped to help

223
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,919
identify uh persons to interview in this

224
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,319
project and also to live the experience

225
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,719
of the researchers as well next slide

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,200
again uh Le The Experience give us a

227
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,440
deeper understanding of how individuals

228
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,519
navigate their worlds how to make

229
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,040
decisions and how they're affected by

230
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,600
various factors

231
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,199
this this will really give us a rich

232
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,519
unique data set as we go about looking

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
at the impact of climate change and

234
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,919
low-income communities again uh it's a

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,839
safe space then the third one is key is

236
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,319
trust uh as I mentioned to Al sh earlier

237
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,839
I'm at a AI conference in Pittsburgh and

238
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,920
they still they're talking about trust

239
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,200
is also an important variable so that's

240
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:27,078
where I want to pick and as we collect

241
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,600
our data use extension agents uh whom

242
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:33,000
they trust to check a nonprofit ility

243
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,600
sample farmers and Community residents

244
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,480
uh to uh collect the the Su data for

245
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,000
this project next slide

246
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,800
please briefly these are the goals of of

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,159
the project we have four goals for this

248
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:50,719
multi-state project the goal one is soy

249
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:53,480
Health goal two is about water security

250
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,320
uh which uh Ali Forest is one of the

251
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,399
leads for uh goal three is dealing with

252
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,959
emmental Justice and and uh climate

253
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,519
equity and go forward is with policy

254
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,559
briefly so these are the goals of the

255
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,120
project you see how all 19 institutions

256
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,838
are participating in this project but

257
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,919
environmental justice as we Define it

258
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,120
refers to the fair treatment and

259
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,439
meaningful involvment of our people

260
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,600
regardless of race color national origin

261
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,160
or

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,040
income uh it also talks about Veil to

263
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,759
environmental laws policies and

264
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,039
decision-making

265
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,200
process so the goal that no group

266
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,719
especially historically marginalized

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,320
underserved communities

268
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
disproportionately Bears the burden of

269
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,600
environmental habits I mean hazards or

270
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,039
Deni access to environmental benefits

271
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,879
such as clean air water and healthy

272
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,278
lifestyle really looking at

273
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,879
disproportional impacts access to

274
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:53,078
resources and impact of climate change

275
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,078
next

276
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,600
slide this is just uh the National

277
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,639
Climate Road mapap this is sort of the

278
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,079
uh framework for future investment and

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,320
climate science research uh I want to

280
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,439
use a reference because even though the

281
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,278
mate project started before this road

282
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,880
map was finished uh our project aligns

283
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:16,000
very well with this the uh the seven

284
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,679
themes and the nine uh principles of of

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
this road map in 1890 scientist was also

286
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,120
involved in this road map these are the

287
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,320
seven themes the one that's particular

288
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,039
particular for this project is

289
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,240
participatory research process and also

290
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,879
so socieconomic policy research analysis

291
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,320
I want to show you this as a guide then

292
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:37,159
the next

293
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,839
slide deals with the guiding principles

294
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,559
equity and Justice is one of the guiding

295
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,680
principles and that's s of the focus of

296
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,278
these presentations but all of these

297
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:49,159
nine guiding principles are inherent uh

298
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:52,240
in our mstate project next

299
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,879
slide this just shows the overlap of The

300
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,639
Guiding principles of the National

301
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:01,120
Climate Change road map with our project

302
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,120
itself next slide

303
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,040
uh essentially uh this is uh one of the

304
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,759
project was funded by USDA ni of the AF

305
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,159
program this was a a h project on

306
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,078
environmental uh environmental justice

307
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:18,319
uh uh area and only one project was

308
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,719
funded and the project was awarded to

309
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,160
North Carina at State University to look

310
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
at environmental justice for lowincome

311
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,399
communities and communities of color

312
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,639
when you show that as a and the Kathleen

313
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,639
leang is one of the

314
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,639
on our project as well next

315
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,838
slide C what Kathleen want to do is uh

316
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,159
basically understand how equity and

317
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,240
distribution of both research

318
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:48,278
Investments and science outcomes in the

319
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,839
four and four a priority areas and

320
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,320
especially using a a graphic probability

321
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,079
buet too she really using a graphic

322
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,480
probability model to look at uh

323
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:02,319
statistics interface with GIS to look at

324
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,600
the to how the research are being uh are

325
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,120
being invested in limited resource

326
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,159
communities next

327
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,078
slide Alton just uh jump in that we're

328
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,879
hoping to get on to the next speaker

329
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:20,399
fairly soon so I know got okay okay move

330
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,399
on next

331
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,120
slide I'm look at this slide then we're

332
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,920
GNA skip to the end this is like one of

333
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,440
the some selected findings this is one

334
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,198
Southern University the first bullet is

335
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,839
they did looked at two parks one

336
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,719
frequently by African-Americans one

337
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,720
frequent by Caucasians you see that in

338
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,000
all three bullets uh in terms of uh the

339
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,879
tree cover the canopy cover the carbon

340
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,120
storage uh the uh uh common storage per

341
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:55,600
year per acre as well as the uh uh

342
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,120
oxygen per term per acre per year

343
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,320
there's a two Sigma difference in the

344
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,959
African-American community ities and the

345
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,360
uh uh Caucasian communities in general

346
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,518
let's get about the next four or five

347
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,839
slides

348
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:13,759
Jennifer and guess as I conclude is one

349
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,959
of the things to ensure uh Community uh

350
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,360
resilience in their communi is to look

351
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,278
at infrastructure development to look at

352
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,839
Financial tools and insurance to look at

353
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:28,078
education and capacity

354
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,079
building next slide

355
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,799
to look at our community lead

356
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,439
adaptations access to climate

357
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,559
information as well as sustainable

358
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,079
agriculture practices is how you really

359
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,278
ensure resilience in our uh low-income

360
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,278
communities next

361
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,759
slide next

362
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:52,719
slide so that's sort of the end of the

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,120
presentation but essentially uh as I

364
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,639
conclude climate change is really an

365
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,000
urgent issue that proportionately uh

366
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,240
affects unders Ser communities where

367
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,879
often most V vulnerable and least

368
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,480
equipped to adapt to impacts again as I

369
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,759
mentioned uh by taking these actions we

370
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,600
ensure that the fight against climate

371
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,039
change is just and inclusive leaving no

372
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
communities behind addressing climate

373
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,679
inequity does not only a matter of

374
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,799
justice but also essential for a

375
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,039
sustainable resilient future thank you

376
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,039
so

377
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:30,078
much and thank you so much Alton that

378
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,440
was very uh apprehensive overview I'm

379
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,078
guessing that some people on the call

380
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,399
like me until I saw your first

381
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,919
presentation some months ago had no idea

382
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,839
about the breadth and scope of work that

383
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,799
you guys are doing are there any

384
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:49,720
questions I see some

385
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:51,479
compliments uh in the chat I do not yet

386
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,079
see any

387
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,519
questions I've got one quick one for you

388
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,198
then and then we'll we'll move on while

389
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,959
we're preparing the next one so so one

390
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,838
of the things you emphasized a lot about

391
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,399
sort of trust in your

392
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,400
relationships uh within the 1890 region

393
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,640
of uh with who you work with so one one

394
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,360
of the one of the things that's I think

395
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,160
particularly interesting for climate

396
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:23,038
work is a tendency for people of color

397
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,519
to care more about climate on the one

398
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,279
hand than you know just looking at

399
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,000
National polling than for than the

400
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:33,639
average American and yet on the other

401
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,679
hand for Rural people to be more

402
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,880
conservative about this topic so I

403
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,400
wonder if you have any just kind of

404
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,559
comments on how you talk about climate

405
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,919
change with your audiences and how you

406
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,160
kind of approach the the agenda you seem

407
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,799
to be very you know some of us have

408
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,880
trouble in some of our states figuring

409
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,720
out how to gain entry into the

410
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,200
conversation even around this topic so

411
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,240
how about with your with the people you

412
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,279
work with primarily the key thing in 189

413
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,159
is the extension uh ageny a really

414
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,759
trusted per person in the community but

415
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,480
also when we do climate change we not

416
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,640
talking about we we sort of uh taking uh

417
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,240
climate change looking at this computer

418
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,520
part and its component parts we may talk

419
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,720
about uh the excessive heat we may talk

420
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,119
about heat we may talking about

421
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,880
windstorms we may talk about flooding

422
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,399
may talk about drought we may talking

423
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,679
about uh have your crop rotation changed

424
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,440
in it so we're GNA sort of break it down

425
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,559
its component parts such that you know

426
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,400
uh also as we collect these data we're

427
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,798
also going to say now when we collect

428
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,159
this data we're going to give you the

429
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,279
results back to help you improve your

430
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,799
operations so you get something in

431
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,759
return for it and really then trust them

432
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,319
with the confidentiality anonymity piece

433
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,599
is you g get something back but we ask

434
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,798
them specific question about how it

435
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,079
affect their last specifically that's

436
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,240
how we're GNA do

437
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,839
it okay thank you so much so I think in

438
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,480
the interest of hearing from our two

439
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,639
other presidentials we'll move along to

440
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,798
the next one you all right thank you

particular to share um what 1890s

447
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,440
extension is doing in in the space of

448
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:25,439
climate and how we're addressing climate

449
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,159
challenges um I am Raymond Shang um Cen

450
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,360
administrator at pres University um as

451
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,520
well as Vice chair for Association

452
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:35,199
extension

453
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:38,879
administrators so just a quick overview

454
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,440
of how I'm of the presentation I we'll

455
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,039
go into a little bit of context and

456
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:48,558
background of why 189's extension um uh

457
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,759
impacts uh how impact climate resilience

458
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,480
um then talk a little bit about National

459
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,759
profit extension organizing around

460
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,679
climate and how that has begun to

461
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:00,440
influence uh the 1890s uh then we'll

462
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,240
talk a little more particulars about uh

463
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,640
our first convenience 1990s um extension

464
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,359
uh regarding climate and uh how we

465
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:15,559
interface researchers um as Dr Thompson

466
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,839
mention all right so um I I'm I'm not

467
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,639
going to go too much in these first

468
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:24,119
slides are going to be a lot of um uh uh

469
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,600
Maps uh few graphs uh but I will say if

470
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,558
you want to go more into uh some of

471
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:33,038
these um some of these graph ICS they

472
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:35,240
are published on a website of the carpet

473
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,000
integrated sustainability Center which

474
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,519
is the center Excellence at T University

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,519
um and all to do is type in

476
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,319
c881 um the first issue of St African

477
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,319
Americans in the black belt which is one

478
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,240
of our Publications uh looks into the

479
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,359
historic black belt counties um and as

480
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,400
you can see um that's where our

481
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,719
primarily our at9 institutions Li uh if

482
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,400
there's any one of our colleagues from

483
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,600
Central State pleasee forgive me for

484
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,480
using this out map uh we do have col now

485
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,879
Central State in Ohio as well so 19

486
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,720
institutions 18 states uh we're very

487
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,400
lucky in Alabama to have two 1890s

488
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,120
Alabama A&amp;M and

489
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,320
universities um so so why why why is

490
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,199
this work so important uh to the

491
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,558
communities that we work in um the

492
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,960
communties that we work in are

493
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,240
economically depressed uh and challenged

494
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
in other way

495
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,880
um that include other social Industries

496
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,120
but I wanted to show here the uh

497
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,960
distressed counties uh not just in which

498
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,599
the institutions are located but in the

499
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,278
counties that each of exension programs

500
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,079
work um they range anywhere this is only

501
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:49,880
10 of the 19 but I just wanted to to

502
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:53,319
choose these 10 to show that range uh

503
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,360
from 100% of the counties uh to 53% of

504
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:59,720
those counties um that we serve uh so

505
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:01,918
that the people do need and continuously

506
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,400
support the extion work in those

507
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,080
communities uh so here's another map

508
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,440
about changes in uh energy expenditures

509
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,519
um and you can see uh the southeast and

510
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,038
Southwest um is is projected to be

511
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,480
heavily impacted uh if you overlay that

512
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,000
on the fact that most of these

513
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,960
communities are economically distressed

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
uh you see that we're heading for not

515
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,360
only climate disaster what other social

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,798
economic disasters in these

517
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:31,678
communities um so we all also uh and

518
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,879
again this will be in actually this

519
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,720
year's upcoming publication in the state

520
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,240
of African-Americans and the black Bel

521
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,400
uh we run of our researchers goes a

522
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,400
little bit deeper uh into some of these

523
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,840
issues uh but there's also uh energy

524
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,038
burdens and projected uh extreme heat

525
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,918
grads uh that are in the communities

526
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,400
that we work in the 1890s um so th those

527
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,919
of you that are are familiar with

528
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,240
extension uh you understand that that a

529
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,278
lot of our work that lies ahead is not

530
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,480
just in um uh cult natural resources but

531
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:05,640
also in family consumer Sciences um

532
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,159
Youth Development as well as cre

533
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,159
Economic

534
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,839
Development all right

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,480
so that that's a little bit of context

536
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,879
as to to why the work is so important

537
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,360
that we're taking on um I I would say

538
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,400
one of the one of the I guess movements

539
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,038
or events that really kind of struck a

540
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,480
nerve with some of our colleagues in

541
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,640
Community was the organizing that uh EOP

542
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,159
the extension committee on organization

543
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,159
policy under the climate program Master

544
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,240
team uh some of the action that they

545
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,559
began to take around organizing around

546
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,400
climate change uh was very influential

547
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,720
influential inre of our work as well um

548
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,640
and that that first climate convening is

549
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:57,440
held last year in tucon um Arizona uh

550
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,440
bringing colleagues from uh 1994 1890s

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,360
and 1863

552
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,880
uh to come and and very much kind of dig

553
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,558
into uh climate issues um and begin to

554
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,440
look at the developing climate action

555
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:13,399
plan for pro extension system across the

556
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,278
country um I one of the some of the

557
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,159
comments that we heard coming out of

558
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,880
this it was one of the most impactful

559
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:24,400
meetings that folks had uh been a part

560
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,200
of where 1862 1890 in 1994 Partners uh

561
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,440
sat around the table sharing their

562
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,679
expertise um as well as their interest

563
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,679
and

564
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,960
figh so coming out of that uh that that

565
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,399
team began to the the core team um of

566
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,440
the program Master team began to uh

567
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:46,678
start to look at some of the work uh

568
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,200
that we needed to then you know that was

569
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,278
more I would say kind of a uh uh we were

570
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,919
taking a cascading look uh some of the

571
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,839
issues and some of the expertise uh they

572
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,799
started to develop that into uh logic

573
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:05,119
models uh or plans of action for the

574
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:07,440
entire system um and you can actually

575
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,519
look this up on extension Foundation

576
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,519
website for the climate action plan has

577
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,798
been released this year um and it's an

578
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,200
excellent document that I think can

579
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,679
actually help uh individual agents but

580
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,720
also extension programs to align

581
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,679
themselves with this national movement

582
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,038
extension towards climate resilience um

583
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,720
so the four models that came out of uh

584
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,440
out of that and that you can see in the

585
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,278
document expanding climate smart

586
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,798
policies and policymaker engagement

587
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,798
fostering climate resilient communities

588
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,679
implementing climate response and

589
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,519
advancing 21st century Community

590
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,640
wellbeing for all uh and as I said

591
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,720
earlier uh if if not in the titles if

592
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,440
you begin to look at the models uh you

593
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,759
begin to see all the program areas that

594
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,120
the reflected in work and the future

595
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,960
work that we're going to have to engage

596
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,199
in in order for the betterment of all of

597
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,200
our communities

598
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,839
so that that being one major influence

599
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,759
but another major influence being um

600
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,959
conversations uh with Dr Alin Thompson

601
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,960
as well as the multi-state research

602
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,399
project uh kind of lifting off uh and

603
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,919
begin to take form um we began to have

604
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,239
some structured conversations in

605
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,320
extension um that were that were that

606
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,038
were actually supported by the

607
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:28,960
Association research directors at their

608
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:31,599
past two conferences um led by Dr uh R

609
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,440
Kenny as well um we began to have

610
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:39,119
internal conversations at some of our AA

611
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:42,480
meetings uh what exactly uh AA could do

612
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,479
um around climate change um I would say

613
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,038
one of the the huge things that

614
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,200
kickstarted this was the uh nrcs climate

615
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,319
smart commodity grants uh that were

616
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,000
awarded to a lot of our institutions um

617
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,839
and a lot of that work is community as

618
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,359
well as um farmer oriented work

619
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,359
uh so that actually began to really push

620
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,719
our extension programs to start to have

621
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,678
some of those conversations about

622
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,640
climate not just with our Farmers but

623
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:15,240
with our communities um so um after that

624
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,120
after having those conversations uh poor

625
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,960
group of us that attended the EOP uh

626
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,798
committee decided that you know we

627
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,640
wanted to have our own convening um as

628
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,679
well as um start to develop uh some

629
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,440
plans and some goals for us internally

630
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,919
189 that aligned not only with the eot

631
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,360
but also aligned with uh Association

632
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,720
research directors in Project as well so

633
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:43,000
Dr Thompson talked a lot more in depth

634
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,480
about this than I am uh but um that 1890

635
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,240
climic convening um and I this was a

636
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,798
hallway conversation that actually

637
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,679
turned into I would say a a large scale

638
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:57,158
event um the technical committee for

639
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,120
ardd once a year and as I was again the

640
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:03,720
plan to have our extenstion colleagues

641
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,879
um uh participate I realized that uh

642
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,440
having them in the same space as the

643
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,519
researchers as we're beginning to

644
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,240
develop our identity and our goals uh in

645
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:18,839
terms of climate task force will be very

646
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,759
helpful for us um so um at the convening

647
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,119
uh the researchers uh their technal

648
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,079
commity usually has a report out day and

649
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,278
then they have a planning day so that

650
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,759
that plan that uh that dat that they

651
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:33,398
reported out extension actually met um

652
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,480
amongst ourselves and the researchers uh

653
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:37,678
reported out but then strategically on

654
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,880
that second day uh we sat with them in

655
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,120
the same room um and looking at this

656
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,679
next year and how that's going to look

657
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,678
of integrating research and extension uh

658
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,120
into that project and I think we had

659
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,320
some really good

660
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,558
conversations um I didn't participate in

661
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,439
all of them but that Justice and policy

662
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,119
group that's a lively group and I think

663
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,320
we've got some good things planned this

664
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:01,639
year that's really going to engage

665
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,558
Community iners around the project and I

666
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,360
do want to shout out my colleague Janine

667
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:09,158
Woods who's associate exension administ

668
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,079
at Virginia State University uh who was

669
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,399
also uh nominated and voted as a

670
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,639
techical team uh which will keep that

671
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,798
strong tie uh between research and

672
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,799
extension as we move forward uh

673
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,480
together so there was another component

674
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,599
to this um uh that I didn't mention

675
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,200
earlier

676
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:34,599
um in

677
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,759
2022 um we we also at Tusk University

678
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:39,079
host the center of excellence performing

679
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,599
systems World prosperity and economic

680
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,960
sustainability uh and through a

681
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:48,240
partnership with uh EPA uh we decided to

682
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,399
deliver our first um environmental

683
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,798
energy and economic Justice Academy um

684
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,599
and the the environmental justice

685
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,240
Academy is something that that has been

686
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:02,398
done for years uh EPA Region 4 and other

687
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,240
regions as well uh but we decided that

688
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,038
you know we could utilize this as a

689
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,880
great opportunity for training extension

690
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,000
professionals uh and also bringing them

691
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,519
together in the same space as Community

692
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,839
organizers and Community leaders of

693
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,759
Community Based organizations uh to be

694
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,639
trained together uh in environmental

695
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,119
economic uh and energy Justice uh and

696
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,159
that economic piece is a piece that we

697
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:30,158
added as well um that's led by Dr Gloria

698
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,360
tanu at University uh she's been a major

699
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,399
major player uh in helping get this off

700
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,359
the ground and we just brought in our

701
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,639
second cohort during our convening um

702
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,599
they didn't get as much time to spend

703
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,399
with us but we did spend time at meals

704
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,719
together but they were hard at work uh

705
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:47,839
uh starting before us uh on that first

706
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,720
day and end ending after us they had

707
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:54,599
their first uh session uh at at the the

708
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,880
convening um and this this year has

709
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:59,839
almost doubled in size in terms of his

710
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,320
participation looking forward uh to the

711
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,638
outcome of that uh this uh year this

712
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,759
spring in

713
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,599
2025 um and then for extension um what

714
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,240
we did at at that meeting especially the

715
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:17,240
first meeting was established um uh our

716
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,919
our Central task force we have about 20

717
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,720
members uh from about seven institutions

718
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,360
um we wanted to we started discussing

719
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,079
existing programs within the different

720
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,638
states and we identified overlap and

721
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,960
potential collaboration that we could

722
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,959
have and as well as identifying key

723
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,200
partners and setting preliminary goals

724
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,558
uh we also had a a focus group meeting

725
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,038
with the 189 extension disaster

726
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,398
education network uh at that meeting as

727
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,919
well uh which I think is going to be a

728
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:48,879
great partner of course going

729
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,080
forward so here's that core task force I

730
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,799
definitely want to make sure that they

731
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,240
get recognized uh for for dedicating

732
00:31:52,798 --> 00:32:00,359
their time um we definitely look to to

733
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,519
grow ourselves but uh this Core Group uh

734
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,798
uh I would say are the folks that going

735
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,839
to ride ride and Di with us uh they

736
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,839
definitely gave up a lot of their time

737
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,720
uh to be there those two days with us um

738
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,599
and we're really really excited looking

739
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,839
forward uh to how we can actually engage

740
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,759
the entire 1890s and greater potential

741
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,398
community so this is just a little

742
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,119
diagram of of how we we are projecting

743
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:28,278
ourselves to move forward um we're

744
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,558
directly related to the um uh cop

745
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,440
climate program action team I

746
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:36,879
participate in that um as I stated early

747
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,480
Dr Woods is um now one the the technical

748
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,799
leadership for ardd multi-state climate

749
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,120
project um I'm an administrative advisor

750
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,398
there as well um and then we actually

751
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:48,719
definitely um following that climate

752
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,479
convenience where I met David and had a

753
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,120
great conversation with him um about

754
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,360
collaboration going forward so we

755
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,479
definitely look to have multiple people

756
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,038
um participating in Nei going forward as

757
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,880
well and I already spoke about one

758
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:05,440
relationship of 1890 similar Excellence

759
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,559
to the task force uh we hope to get

760
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,880
participation from the other um centers

761
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,038
as well and then we definitely want to

762
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,278
connect ourselves with USDA the regional

763
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:20,000
climate hubs nifa uh nrcs R development

764
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,880
and uh Forest Service as well and then

765
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,638
also uh National Regional nonprofit

766
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,840
organizations and Foundations and one of

767
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:29,519
the things that uh we are doing

768
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,278
currently in the traditional program

769
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,038
areas in aea is developing uh shared

770
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,398
outcome measures uh that way we can have

771
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:41,599
more of a collective impact um and we we

772
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:43,759
did already start going through the

773
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,678
shared measures and pulling out ones

774
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,839
that relate climate so we are definitely

775
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,480
looking to become a repository for the

776
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,000
1890s extension work that's happening in

777
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,200
the

778
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,119
area so so simple outputs uh that we

779
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,038
identified is uh trainings for extension

780
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,879
workshops uh training for extension

781
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,839
professionals workshops for Community um

782
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,159
some conferences that already exist uh

783
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,159
that could be adapted uh to highlight

784
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,960
showcase some of the extension work that

785
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,639
is going on um and then also

786
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,679
Publications and media as I mentioned

787
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,399
earlier um this year's issue of state of

788
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,679
African-Americans in the black belt will

789
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,598
be solely focused on climate change um I

790
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,440
really look forward to that uh being

791
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,639
released in November after professional

792
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,720
agricultural workers conference uh that

793
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,960
team normally has a session where they

794
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,279
present um and then we actually will

795
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,878
release that publication there as

796
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,280

797
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:44,799
that we we and goals that we uh decided

798
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,320
on uh we will have professional

799
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:52,039
development uh that will be Allah the uh

800
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,519
EXT U environmental justice academy uh

801

but we're looking at some uh trainings

802
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:58,358

our other instit

804
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:05,239
and expanding those to the region um

together uh especially you know in a

834
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,800
fairly short time period even with the

835
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,598
deeper roots that you talked about so

836
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,880
are there any questions let me just

837
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,800
check the Q&amp;A I don't see any open ones

838
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,519
there uh I again I'm going to have one

839
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,000
if no one else does for you

840
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,079
um uh there may be some coming later so

841
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,358
you know for those so when you think it

842
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,280
when you're talking about sort of the

843
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:47,358
Partnerships which we're we're starting

844
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,200
to work

845
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,920
on how is the what's the right way this

846
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,439
maybe for all of you but I'll I'll

847
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,480
address it to you particularly with an

848
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,519
extension uh how do we you know do we

849
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,240
think of the 18 90s should should we who

850
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:06,838
are not from an 1890 should we be

851
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:09,439
thinking of the 1890s as a national in

852
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,199
scope or primarily Regional given the

853
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,318
maps that you showed about where where

854
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,480
you're located and you know in what

855
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,880
context should we think I'm G to assume

856
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,440
in some ways we should think about you

857
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,358
as a national part of the system a part

858
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,519
of a national system and other ways

859
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:26,358
regionally but maybe you can articulate

860
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:29,599
that a little better for the rest of

861
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,679
us yeah I I I think so I think it it's

862
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,160
definitely National I think uh even in

863
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:38,039
in Dr Thompson's presentation he was

864
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,598
mentioning that experience uh that kind

865
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:45,079
of experience-based

866
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:47,039
um uh research and engagement um so I

867
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,160
I'll say this we have Partners

868
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,000
Nationwide right I I have Partnerships

869
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,318
and programs of commity based

870
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,119
organizations Chicago Philadelphia

871
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:59,119
Washington DC uh Seattle um these things

872
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,200
have have come out of the the

873
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,160
familiarity with communities in the area

874
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,838
as well and I think that to a degree um

875
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,000
you know we don't have to be

876
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:12,679
isolationist in those uh those those in

877
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,519
that regard uh we can actually help to

878
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,679
facilitate more communication between

879
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,480
those communities and some of the 1862

880
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,879
in that area as well so definitely

881
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,440
National in scope as well uh because of

882
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,480
the the network that we have mus REM the

883
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,318
is music to my ear thank you I would say

884
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,719
if I may that even goes beyond National

885
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:38,079
if we know that more than 80% of the

886
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:40,679
farmers globally are limited resources

887
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,519
small farmers I think the issues that

888
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,838
the 1890 deal with has more also

889
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,039
relevant at the at the national level at

890
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,400
the international level as

891
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,960
well Dr Dr ver I might add to that

892
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,599
because not everybody would know this

893
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,159
but there is also within extension uh

894
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,318
another organization ation called the

895
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,838
globalizing extension Innovation Network

896
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,599
which some people may have heard of

897
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:09,440
which is trying to think uh very hard

898
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,119
about how how what we do in a globalized

899
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,240
world here how what we do here in the US

900
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,000
relates to the reality that we're all in

901
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:19,000
a world with climate just being one of

902
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,159
the many Global forces that we're that

903
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,199
we're all dealing with so maybe we could

904
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:26,358
move on that's a good transition to your

905
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,039
presentation then is it is it set up and

906
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:31,679
ready to go

907
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:35,719
yes I just W to thank you uh good

908
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:40,000
afternoon uh everyone and thank you for

909
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:42,879
attending this uh SE seminar and also

910
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,159
the opportunity for from David and also

911
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,960
Jennifer for this opportunity to uh

912
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,598
really feature some of the great work

913
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,440
that our 1890 institution are being

914
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,119
doing at at at this level uh about this

915
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,880
important topic about climate change so

916
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,599
I'm Ali Ferris uh I'm a professor at

917
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Water security water energy food Nexus

918
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,280
at PRM

919
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:12,439
University uh which is in Texas I like

920
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,960
to talk to you today about uh leveraging

921
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Ai and Innovation to empower Future

922
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,920
Leaders and resource limited

923
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:25,640
communities uh okay if my slide can go

924
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,319
to the next one that would be helpful

925
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:29,920
okay so the outline of my presentation

926
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:32,440
and I'm going to have an introduction

927
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,680
about uh the challenges uh of limited

928
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,119
resource communities as it relates to

929
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:40,440
the topic also the water energy food

930
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,559
Nexus and why is it and how it is

931
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,400
relevant to the discussion what is the

932
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:49,799
role of AI and Innovation and addressing

933
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,960
uh challenges related to this topic uh

934
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,400
so uh and though also how can we Empower

935
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,280
Future Leaders through education and

936
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,599
Outreach and at the end summary and

937
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,040
conclusions so the objective of my uh

938
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,800
objectives of my uh presentation would

939
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:11,000
be to highlight the integration of AI

940
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,079
and innovation in addressing resource CH

941
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,838
challenges and also to discuss how

942
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,440
training Future Leaders can make a

943
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:24,440
significant impact in resource limited

944
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,318
communities so uh some of the challenges

945
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:31,240
of limited communities are uh

946
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:33,559
highlighted here uh low access to

947
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,838
resources these communities encounter

948
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,679
significant barriers in assessing uh

949
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:43,799
essential resources and services in the

950
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:46,719
water food and energy health and

951
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,920
education such as you know it's very

952
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,959
prevalent to know food deserts and

953
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,440
health deserts and in these communities

954
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,679
uh this restricted access inhibits

955
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,639
individual and Community Development and

956
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,078
complicate

957
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,799
think responses to public health

958
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,200
issues uh also an adequate

959
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,839
infrastructure and funding contributes

960
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:12,078
to a persistent cycle of

961
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,519
deprivation uh another challenge is

962
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,880
socioeconomic challenges these

963
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,239
communities often face high unemployment

964
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,800
and low income levels these conditions

965
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:28,558
lead to systemic inequalities and hinder

966
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,519
economic stability uh Limited E economic

967
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:37,319
diversity and V amplifies vulnerability

968
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:37,318
to Market changes complicating growth

969
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:45,119
efforts so

970
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,800
uh climate change uh exacerbate all

971
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,920
these challenges they have been facing

972
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,599
and these communities are more

973
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,599
vulnerable to climate change than other

974
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,519
communities so increased vulnerability

975
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,200
are especially vulnerable these

976
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,679
communities to climate change imp

977
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:04,399
impacts due to their Reliance on natural

978
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:07,480
resources and low adaptive cap

979
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,119
capacity a challenges such as a flooding

980
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,280
and reduced crop yield threaten

981
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,960
livelihoods making adaptation difficult

982
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,040
due to socioeconomic instability and

983
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:23,880
more most of more often you have

984
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:27,318
multiple or complicating of uh uh uh

985
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,920
disaster that hit these communities uh

986
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,880
uh mitigating strategies for climate

987
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,200
change uh addressing climate

988
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,079
vulnerability requires an integrated

989
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,078
solution uh involving infrastructure and

990
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,119
Community

991
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,039
engagement uh also effective strategy

992
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,358
must be context specific focusing on the

993
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,159
unique challenges of limited resources

994
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:53,078
communities building resilience through

995
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:57,960
local participation can enhance the

996
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,960
added capacity of these communities

997
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,440
so I'm going to talk today right now

998
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,639
about uh the Water Energy food Nexus and

999
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,800
its relevance to sustainability and

1000
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,279
empowerment of limited resources

1001
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:18,599
community so this graph

1002
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:20,920
shows uh basically the uh water energy

1003
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:25,800
and food and there the interlinkages

1004
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:28,920
between them you need uh water for food

1005
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,160
like irrigation crop food processing Etc

1006
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,440
you need food for energy like

1007
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:37,318
agrochemicals food processing farm and

1008
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,639
you need buy fuel for example for energy

1009
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:44,318
to produce energy the same thing you

1010
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:48,558
need energy to for power H for example

1011
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:51,400
uh uh fuel production to uh uh water

1012
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,920
distribution to Heating and Cooling Etc

1013
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,200
but also you need water for energy Etc

1014
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,920
so there are interlinkages between

1015
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:02,879
these different three components uh

1016
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:07,159
within them but also they are influenced

1017
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:11,039
by climate change population growth and

1018
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:15,838
also uh uh governability how to govern

1019
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:17,759
these and and uh uh uh Commodities uh so

1020
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,558
that's where we talk about water

1021
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,800
security energy security and food

1022
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:28,200
security so as you can see dealing with

1023
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,760
issues of water uh by itself on a silo

1024
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:33,279
has not been productive so we need to

1025
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,559
deal with the water issue energy issue

1026
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:39,760
and a food in an excess

1027
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:42,640
approach so that's why uh the Water

1028
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,000
Energy presentent a critical uh anti

1029
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:48,279
interconnected system essentially for

1030
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,440
essential for sustainability where each

1031
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,839
element influence the other and impact

1032
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,159
the global challenges climate change

1033
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:57,639
food security

1034
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:00,318
Etc so sustainable the

1035
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,679
there are lots of I'm sure most of you

1036
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,440
are familiar with the 17 goals of

1037
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:08,078
sustainable development goals by the UN

1038
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,318
number six is clean water and sanitation

1039
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:15,200
number seven is Affordable clean energy

1040
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:18,599
so uh also uh about food there is also

1041
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:23,519
food security as well so these three uh

1042
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:27,318
topics involve several of the sdgs uh uh

1043
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:29,880
of the un uh empowering through action

1044
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,759
so uh Community engagement involving

1045
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,640
local community in water management and

1046
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,040
their food security and their energy

1047
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,159
security is essential uh also uh

1048
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,759
innovative

1049
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,519
solutions uh implementing Technologies

1050
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,119
such as smart irrigation renewable

1051
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,639
energy in agriculture and homes Empower

1052
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:51,358
Farmers to enhance their productivity

1053
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:54,039
and sustainability and reduce for examp

1054
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:58,400
residential energy

1055
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:59,358
costs so uh how can we transform limited

1056
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,000
resource

1057
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:05,639
Community uh uh through technology as we

1058
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,880
mentioned empowering them local solution

1059
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,400
research driven approaches and Community

1060
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,280
engagement as it has been discussed in

1061
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,079
the previous couple of slides so let's

1062
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,920
talk about uh uh empowering future

1063
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:23,480
leader through education and Outreach uh

1064
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,760
an importance of historically black

1065
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,559
colleges and University and leadership

1066
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,960
development also uh we'll talk about

1067
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,800
some Outreach activities my program have

1068
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,240
been doing and developing some

1069
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,318
leadership skills uh as part of our uh

1070
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,000
land grant program here at PRM

1071

1088
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:32,239
Based learning for local challenges and

1089
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:35,199
my previous colleagues who talked about

1090
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:38,759
uh extension they are in every single

1091
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:42,519
County in the nation so uh where you

1092
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:46,040
have also in our area and in the 1890

1093
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,960
South Eastern Area we are also as as as

1094
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,960
it's shown in the previous talk

1095
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,960
represented in most of the counties and

1096
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,240
counties that are really read the

1097
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,559
services with li limited

1098
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:02,159
resources community engagement and

1099
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:04,079
service 60% of hpcu Alum alumni engage

1100
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,039

sustainability and the first Speaker uh

1107
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,960
discussed that in detail alumni often

1108
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:26,719
take leadership role in local government

1109
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,519
and nonprofits initiatives in urban

1110
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:33,078

businesses

1118
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:57,480
Etc so gonna talk right now about

1119
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,119
Outreach activities

1120
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,318
designed to engage students in Ai and

1121
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,480

leadership

1123
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,960
skills uh one project that is funded

1124
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:14,400
through nefa capacity building no nefa

1125
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,838
uh uh uh main uh uh funding is called

1126
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,240
get act smart building capacity in smart

1127
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:20,920
agriculture technology for Enders served

1128
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:24,199
Community this is a joint project

1129
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,280
between prview and texam University uh

1130
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,000
this project will enhance the training

1131
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,559
of under represented students and

1132
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,960
agriculture disciplines also provide

1133
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:36,160
training for agriculture professional on

1134
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:39,318
advancing agriculture technology through

1135
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,358
uh informal learning uh objects

1136
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:45,119
developing by youth

1137
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:50,078
participants so we are dealing with uh

1138
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:52,119
and this uh graph or schematic summarize

1139
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,240
the activities of the project basically

1140
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:58,920
we are dealing with smart technology in

1141
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,479
agricult culture as the center dealing

1142
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,400
with issues of post harvesting

1143
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,639
agriculture production uh human and

1144
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,079
animal nutrition water resources and

1145
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:10,679
food and feed through using these

1146
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,039
Innovative Technologies like sensing and

1147
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:16,358
iot big data analytics modeling and

1148
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:20,400
virtual reality and how to train

1149
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:24,199
students and understanding uh this uh uh

1150
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,760
interaction between a and and these new

1151
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:31,439
technologies so a part of this project

1152
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,480
we gave lectures to non agriculture

1153
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,519
students so this

1154
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:41,440
was uh given lectures given last year uh

1155
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:43,358
to uh College college station students

1156
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,798
the educational career awareness of the

1157
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:50,078
impact of lecturing so to grad stud the

1158
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:52,960
objective was to analyze climate smart

1159
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,960
agriculture students knowledge outcomes

1160
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,318
from uh giving them presentation about

1161
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,159
climate smart agriculture so we give

1162
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,798
presentation we test the student before

1163
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,318
and after and we see the impact of this

1164
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:07,798
on their of this analysis found that the

1165
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:09,679
intervention or the lectures enhanced

1166
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:12,519
all student knowledge about climate

1167
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:15,199
smart agriculture Innovations and career

1168
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:17,719
opportunities however the impact was

1169
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,598
higher with under represented student

1170
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,959
more than other student from the

1171
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,039
interventions second finding the

1172
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,920
intervention elevated interest in

1173
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,719
pursuing uh climate smart agriculture

1174
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,000
career uh and postgraduation as well uh

1175
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:35,759
so the project has developed outlet for

1176
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,719
curent knowledge through

1177
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,760
transdisciplinary and

1178
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:44,838
multidisciplinary uh uh multidisiplinary

1179
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,839
un uh and problem solving learning for

1180
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:52,679
all interested students uh

1181
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:55,759
so another uh project funded also

1182
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:57,838
through capacity building this one is AI

1183
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,559
based program for advancing research and

1184
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,400
education and extension activity and

1185
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,240
precision agriculture at PRM University

1186
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,440
so the goal of this project was to

1187
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:10,759
strength the research student training

1188
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,720
and extension cap capacity at PR viiew

1189
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,640
in Ai and remote sensing to deal with

1190
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:18,399
crop stress so it has dissemination

1191
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,199
component training component and of

1192
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,200
course research

1193
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,920
components uh this is just again as

1194
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,119
heads up where we have a couple more

1195
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,798
minutes and then sure some people are

1196
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:33,079
going to have to leave so y we I will

1197
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:36,119
wrap up so this is the experimental of

1198
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:39,318
the two experiment this is the a graph

1199
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:42,240
showing the two experiment these are uh

1200
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:44,759
uh data collection by students

1201
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:48,879
postgraduate uh and all these

1202
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:53,400
Technologies AI based and CO2 emissions

1203
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:58,960
and uh I'm sorry what's happened I think

1204
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:04,200
I accidentally hit my sorry I I'll

1205
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:06,679
okay let me go back finish so we have

1206
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:09,759
organized field demonstration in this

1207
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:12,960
case for example we have uh PhD and

1208
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,040
graduate students from UT Austin uh

1209
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,358
undergraduate student from PV and Texas

1210
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,318
A&amp;M and these are uh K through 12

1211
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:24,279
through Act Discovery all came in one

1212
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:27,239
day and at the same field you can see

1213
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,960
multigeneration learning about smart

1214
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:34,078
agriculture liit climate change by our

1215
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:36,960
group in our our site so

1216
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,559
um and of course

1217
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,838
uh okay so this is again also similar

1218
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:47,960
field days and demonstrations uh we also

1219
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:49,920
have U ouru uh funded by nefa also

1220
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,318
projects where we demonstrate for the

1221
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:58,000
students uh how to use uh uh uh

1222
00:54:54,318 --> 00:55:01,119
technology also to solve water issues uh

1223
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,679
we engage community Through Field Day

1224
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,838
programs is showing the activities that

1225
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:10,279
we conducted as part of that field day

1226
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:13,000
uh also again field day uh this is part

1227
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:16,000
of the uh another Field Day a

1228
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,719
demonstration that we have of course we

1229
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,960
have this is some of the colleagues that

1230
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:23,759
participated in the project we also uh

1231
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,000
developed some uh extension bulletins

1232
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,119
this is a video I'll pass is these are

1233
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,559
extens bulletin that we develop based uh

1234
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,599
fact sheets that we going to that are

1235
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:37,119
available that we use as a part of our

1236
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,880
outreach program uh communicating with

1237
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:44,358
local TV here about droughts uh in in

1238
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:47,760
conclusions uh AI Technology Innovation

1239
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:49,679
offer transformative uh solution uh for

1240
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,000
the challenges faced in limited

1241
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,759
resources communities these Innovation

1242
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,760
can directly impact sustainability

1243
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,880
climate resilience and Community

1244
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,039
well-being

1245
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,838
we can make a difference whether through

1246
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,960
supporting existing initiatives or

1247
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:06,480
replacing replicating these Solutions

1248
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,400
and our communities let's work together

1249
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:13,159
to create lasting change by fostering

1250
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:15,798
innovation in the face of challenges and

1251
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:19,078
this uh of course we have to thank our

1252
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:21,759
team these are uh uh my team my

1253
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:24,519
colleagues working with us and we cannot

1254
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,760
end without acknowledging the support

1255
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:28,559
from nefa USDA nefa

1256
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,039
for their capacity building and and

1257
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:35,440
other uh funding also the NSF and Agri

1258
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,160
life with that I'll be happy to

1259
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,240
entertain any of your question if you

1260
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:41,480
have

1261
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:45,279
any uh thank you so much once again I I

1262
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,880
really wish we had a whole hour from now

1263
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,559
to

1264
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,240
to delve into a little more discussion

1265
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,839
and dialogue about this I know it's a

1266
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:56,639
very packed program um but and some

1267
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:59,199
people have had to leave already but if

1268
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,759
there are any questions I'm not seeing

1269
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,598
any right

1270
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,200
off once

1271
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:11,280
again since I always have questions I'm

1272
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:14,679
GNA ask you one though um um so I

1273
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:17,200
appreciate and relate and and applaud

1274
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:20,358
sort of the focus you had in leadership

1275
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:23,399
development in in your presentation I

1276
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:25,000
wonder to what extent you think about

1277
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,798
there's a connection between what you're

1278
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,960
trying to do there and something that

1279
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:33,239
we're hearing more and more about in the

1280
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:35,400
climate and energy context about the uh

1281
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:39,679
relationship between leadership

1282
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:43,240
development and uh leadership training

1283
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:46,759
and job Readiness and job preparedness

1284
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:48,639
in the context of the the need for a

1285
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,440
different set of

1286
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:53,798
skills uh for particularly for students

1287
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,639
coming out but also adult training

1288
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:57,280
people coming out of uh you know having

1289
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,279
to make it transition in a different

1290
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,319
economy basically any thoughts about

1291
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,880
that yeah I think I can tell you that

1292
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:07,239
our uh college is on the lead on this

1293
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,640
effort we develop a new Ms degree

1294
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:12,318
program in natural source environmental

1295
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,879
science that deals with uh where we

1296
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:18,079
teach all these components we are in the

1297
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,358
process of developing a PhD program on

1298
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,119
water energy food Nexus and

1299
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:25,279
sustainability where we emphasizing some

1300
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,798
of these principle that we are talking

1301
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,760
emphasize more because for on the

1302
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:34,038
training the professional on the job of

1303
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:37,039
the future so they need skills that they

1304
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:39,720
uh the the conventional or uh uh

1305
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,400
conventional uh curricula didn't offer

1306
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:45,959
them so we have to modify our curricula

1307
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:48,358
to address those uh future and current

1308
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,960
needs all right have a great day just

1309
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:53,960
one one last quick thing just uh in case

1310
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:58,519
there's a quick

1311
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:01,838
answer uh are you connecting AI in the

1312
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:06,838
work you're doing with machine learning

1313
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:09,599
models in any way yes uh I I assume the

1314
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,759
question is for me right yes yes we do

1315
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,200
in fact we do some we we we have

1316
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,039
published some work on using machine

1317
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:18,759
learning and analyzing like the

1318
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:21,680
connection between CO2 emission and

1319
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,119
temperature and soil moisture and other

1320
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:27,358
factors that influence that particular

1321
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:29,119
thing and okay thank you so much and

1322
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:32,759
