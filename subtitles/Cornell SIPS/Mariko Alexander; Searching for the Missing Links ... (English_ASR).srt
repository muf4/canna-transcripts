1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,700
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:07,278
University and thank you guys all for

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,960
being here I am really excited to share

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,900
with you what I've been working on for

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,549
the last six years in Polara virus

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:20,268
research oh and I just realized my mic

7
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:22,429
spot on okay better okay um so my

8
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:25,219
research focuses on plant pathogenic

9
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:28,609
viruses in the genus Polara virus and

10
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:30,919
the family Lou do Verity Polara viruses

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,780
have a single-stranded positive sense

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,660
RNA genome meaning that the genome

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,960
itself is protein coding these viruses

14
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:41,509
moved in both a Fidesz icosahedral

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,910
variants unlike many other plant

16
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,250
pathogenic viruses bleurgh viruses are

17
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:48,709
transmitted exclusively by aphids in a

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,230
circulat of non propagated manner if

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,570
it's deposit baryons directly into the

20
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:55,729
phloem shown here in red while they're

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,740
feeding the virus then replicates and

22
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,719
moves systemically but never crosses out

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,520
of the flow on this phloem restriction

24
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,589
is believed to be an adaptation to

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,040
facilitate acquisition by SAP feeding

26
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:09,790
aphids the symptoms caused by Polara

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,800
virus infection vary by host and species

28
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,660
but often include intervening chlorosis

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,709
as you can see in this infected hairy

30
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,500
nightshade plant Polara viruses are an

31
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,149
emerging problem worldwide shown here is

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,079
a summary of the geographic distribution

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,390
of new and emerging Polara viruses in

34
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,549
2018 alone purple stars with pop-out

35
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,129
boxes represent new color of iris

36
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,959
species the same year Klara virus

37
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:38,479
species were reported for the first time

38
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,179
on eight new hosts shown by blue stars

39
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,060
and in seven new countries shown by

40
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,710
orange stars like other RNA viruses

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,890
Polara viruses mutate and evolve

42
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,629
extremely rapidly therefore even species

43
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,000
that have not been an issue in an area

44
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,819
for many years can experience a

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,500
resurgence if new strains emerge

46
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,449
additionally the use of insecticides to

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,150
control a third vectors is neither

48
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,100
cost-efficient nor effective by the time

49
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,469
a grower realizes they have a Bolero

50
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,699
virus in their field it's often too late

51
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,068
to contain the outbreak

52
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,920
additionally insecticide resistance is a

53
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:15,259
growing issue in aphids

54
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,149
fortunately we have several well studied

55
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:20,359
Claire virus species that we can use as

56
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,760
models potato leaf roll virus or peel RV

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,920
effect solanaceous plants and causes a

58
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,629
net necrosis disease of potato that was

59
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,139
once an enormous problem in the United

60
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,740
States

61
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:32,659
turnip yellows virus or tu ivy is a

62
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,959
pathogen of brassicas and is currently

63
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,849
of economic importance on canola decades

64
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,890
of research have generated an excellent

65
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,530
toolkit for studying these two viruses

66
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:44,929
including infectious clones which allow

67
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,140
us to inoculate plants by agro bacterium

68
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,930
infiltration theory on purification

69
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,879
protocols a wealth of homemade and

70
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,260
commercially available antibodies which

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,799
are useful for Eliza

72
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:59,829
Western blot and other applications and

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,689
protocols for rearing 1/3 vectors

74
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,459
finally I've labeled this box virus

75
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,310
mutant library but the real resource

76
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,409
here is Stewart Grey who is one of the

77
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,780
foremost Polara virus biologists in the

78
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:13,849
world and we're fortunate to have him

79
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,400
located here at Cornell just across the

80
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,739
street from our lab Stewart has been

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,409
incredibly generous with his expertise

82
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:25,610
his equipment and of course his mutant

83
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,689
library I shouldn't do that and this

84
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,290
project would not have been possible

85
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:32,180
without him another advantage to working

86
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:33,798
with polio viruses in general is the

87
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,500
small size of their genome which is

88
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,390
about 5.8 kilobases and encodes only

89
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,299
nine known proteins which I'll walk you

90
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,219
through briefly p0 functions in

91
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,879
suppressing hosts silencing which is the

92
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:49,250
primary plant defense against viruses p1

93
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,900
and p2 and kotipalli protein and a

94
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,650
fusion protein which are important for

95
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,159
replication p3 a and p4 function and

96
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,959
movement and plants P 3 and P 5 are

97
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,400
structural proteins which form the

98
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,979
capsid I'll talk about these a little

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,170
more in the next slide and the functions

100
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:10,909
of p6 and p7 remain mysterious as

101
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:13,819
mentioned previously Polara viruses have

102
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:16,788
icosahedral variants the capsid is made

103
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,129
primarily of coat protein or CP shown in

104
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:21,858
blue and in courted encoded by or 3

105
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:24,560
Hager sporadic read-through of an Amber

106
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,339
stop codon causes translation through or

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,689
v producing a C

108
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,089
terminal extension called the

109
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,339
read-through domain or RTD shown here in

110
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:35,489
orange the resulting read-through

111
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:38,099
protein or RTP is incorporated into the

112
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,990
capsid at a low frequency with the RTD

113
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,050
projecting outward from the capsid

114
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,030
surface the RTD is also found in an

115
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,668
unincorporated form which has been shown

116
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,529
to have its own functions mutational

117
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:51,959
analyses primarily from Stuart's lab

118
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:54,329
have pinpointed regions in the CP and

119
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,789
RTD which are important for very on

120
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:59,509
assembly a fortress mission movement and

121
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:03,000
plants and restriction to flow um tissue

122
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:05,189
in spite of the many tools available for

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,110
Calero virus research the structural

124
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,629
biology of these viruses remains

125
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,610
difficult to study for starters Polara

126
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:13,319
viruses are phloem limited which means

127
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,270
that they're located in tissue that's

128
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,490
hard to lyse and hard to separate from

129
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:19,288
other tissues this also means that the

130
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,600
overall virus titer in the plant is

131
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:24,538
quite low as most of the plant cells are

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,610
actually not infected consequently it's

133
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,538
difficult to obtain a large quantity of

134
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,550
pure baryons

135
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:31,800
because of these and other challenges

136
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,199
there is no publicly available crystal

137
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,300
structure for any polio virus virion or

138
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,550
structural protein which limits our

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,240
ability to infer how mutations impact

140
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,038
structure one technique commonly used

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,680
for studying polio virus structural

142
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,259
biology is an RNA z' protection assay in

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,780
this assay barians extracted from plants

144
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,779
are subjected to a short treatment with

145
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:57,989
RNA s-- which digests any RNA that is

146
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,418
not protected by a capsid after rnase

147
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,699
treatment the protected RNA is extracted

148
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,500
and used for cDNA synthesis and the

149
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,319
presence of the viral genome is assessed

150
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,970
by conventional PCR in baryon

151
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,189
preparations that have not been

152
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,349
subjected to RNA Streetman the genome is

153
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:15,870
intact for both the wild type virus and

154
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,569
this Delta CP mutant which is a mutant

155
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,160
that does not produce Furion's

156
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:22,199
however the absence of the capsid in the

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,599
Delta CP mutant leaves the genome

158
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,149
vulnerable to RNAs resulting in near

159
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,969
total degradation of viral RNA after

160
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,829
RNAi Streetman this assay can be used to

161
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,870
check whether mutations in the CP and

162
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:38,759
RTP affect virion assembly so this is an

163
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,840
example of one mewn from Stuart's lab

164
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,509
that has been test

165
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,969
in this way this mutant contains two

166
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,740
point mutations resulting in a leucine -

167
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,669
prolene and a histidine - prolene

168
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,579
substitution

169
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:52,649
although the viral genome is produced we

170
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,959
can see clearly in an rnase protection

171
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:57,149
assay that variance are unstable or

172
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,918
incomplete indicating that this mutation

173
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:03,448
disrupts capsid formation or stability

174
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:05,459
RNA protection and other classical

175
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,800
approaches to studying culero viruses

176
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,620
have connected many mutations in the cpe

177
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,960
and RTD to defects in virion assembly

178
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,629
movement in plants and atha transmission

179
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,579
yet we're still missing something how is

180
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,829
it that these small changes in Co

181
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:23,009
protein sequence lead to a change in

182
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:25,439
function and the missing link here is

183
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,779
protein structure these mutations can

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,180
result in small or large perturbations

185
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,129
in coat protein structure which in turn

186
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,168
may impact virion assembly or

187
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,569
interactions with plants and atha to

188
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:38,849
proteins these changes are especially

189
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,918
important for Polara viruses which move

190
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,460
systemically and plants and a Fidesz

191
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,469
Furion's however as I mentioned before

192
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,779
there are no publicly available crystal

193
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,180
structures for any poliovirus virion or

194
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,099
structural protein without knowing what

195
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,228
these proteins look like how can we link

196
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,349
these changes in sequence to disruptions

197
00:07:55,228 --> 00:08:00,209
in the viral life cycle to try to

198
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:02,310
approach this problem from another angle

199
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:06,449
we applied protein interaction reporter

200
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,310
or PIR technology PR technology utilizes

201
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,348
a mass spec compatible cross linker

202
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,180
developed by our collaborator Jim Bruce

203
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,969
at the University of Washington in

204
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,220
Seattle this is a schematic of the PIR

205
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,229
cross linker at the bottom are two

206
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,620
reactive groups which react with solvent

207
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:24,120
exposed lysines on the surface proteins

208
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,430
applying this cross linker to a mixture

209
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,000
of protein complexes allows us to freeze

210
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,769
protein protein interactions after

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,870
cross-linking we break the proteins into

212
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:37,288
smaller pieces by digesting with trypsin

213
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,179
a biotin tag on the cross linker allows

214
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,979
us to enrich for cross-linked peptides

215
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,879
before we run the samples through the

216
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,800
mass spec next a massive coded reporter

217
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,958
at the center of the cross linker allows

218
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,120
us to pinpoint cross-linked peptides in

219
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,139
the mass spec targeting them for further

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
analysis

221
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,889
finally the mass spec cleavable bonds

222
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,750
connecting the reactive groups to the

223
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,939
rest of the cross linker enable

224
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,669
isolation and fragmentation of the

225
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,500
peptides and each cross-linked pair the

226
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,929
mass spec cleavable bonds are what make

227
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,970
PIR revolutionary as they're what allow

228
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:13,079
us to easily determine which peptides

229
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,940
are cross linked to one another

230
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,100
application of the PIR cross linker to

231
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,860
protein complexes yields several types

232
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,649
of cross links some like these ones in

233
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,169
pink occur between two interacting

234
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,209
proteins the cross linker can also react

235
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:29,649
with two nearby reactive sites on the

236
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,440
same protein as shown by the yellow

237
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,299
arrows finally we see some dead end

238
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,090
cross links like these ones in black

239
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:38,769
between reactive sites and water these

240
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,480
cross links are actually still useful

241
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,139
because they tell us which regions of

242
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,230
the protein are solvent exposed because

243
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:49,480
PIR technology identifies not only which

244
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,550
proteins interact with one another but

245
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,740
also which residues were cross-linked it

246
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,079
gives us information that we can use for

247
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,029
structural modeling this is great

248
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,220
because computational modeling without

249
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,500
any other information often results in

250
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,660
hundreds or thousands of possible models

251
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,399
as shown by the myriad of ways we can

252
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:10,089
imagine putting this green protein and

253
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,949
blue protein together however finding a

254
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,320
cross link for example between the red

255
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,060
dots on these proteins tells us that

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,660
these red dots have to be near enough

257
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:21,309
for a cross linker to connect them using

258
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:23,319
the length of the cross linker arms as a

259
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:26,729
distance constraint we can instantly

260
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,140
eliminate many of the possible models

261
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,610
this brings me to the research portion

262
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,590
of my talk which I'm going to divide

263
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,960
into two sections based on the type of

264
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,610
cross links that we found in the first

265
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,680
section I'll talk about some work in

266
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,710
structural biology of Polara viruses

267
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,629
using PIR guided modeling in the second

268
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,690
part of the talk I'll detail how we used

269
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:48,549
PIR to explore host virus interactions I

270
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,050
also want to remind you that my

271
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:51,969
experiments are going to alternate

272
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,039
between the use of our to model polio

273
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,420
viruses potato leaf roll virus and

274
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:01,480
turnip yellows virus okay so let's talk

275
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:04,089
about structural biology in the absence

276
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,529
of a crystal structure we can use PIR to

277
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,000
make guided predictions using

278
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,980
computational models

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,620
in fact michelle heck juan chavez and

280
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,210
stacy de blasio have already used PIR

281
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,580
cross-linking data to generate

282
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,580
computational models of the PLR Vico

283
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,379
protein trimer and my goal in this first

284
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,170
section of my talk is to extend these

285
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,059
techniques to TU IV even though the co

286
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:27,969
protein sequence is remarkably well

287
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:30,819
conserved across bolero viruses these

288
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,379
fires pilar b and tu IV have different

289
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,540
hosts and can cause them to different

290
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,220
symptoms so we didn't know whether the

291
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:40,870
interaction topologies would be

292
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,910
conserved to apply PIR to study Polara

293
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,639
viruses we first do a protein extraction

294
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:48,189
from infected tissue then we do a crude

295
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,439
theory on purification which enriches

296
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,230
for very ons while retaining some host

297
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,760
virus interactions applying the PIR

298
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,220
cross linker to this sample

299
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,889
lens data about interactions between

300
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,889
viral proteins as well as interactions

301
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:04,360
between viral and host proteins

302
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,759
importantly the atha transmissibility of

303
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,220
every crude virion purification is

304
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,870
tested prior to cross-linking to ensure

305
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,160
that the samples contain intact

306
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,570
biologically active variants so here's

307
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,419
what we found when we applied this

308
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,970
workflow to tu ib this is a schematic of

309
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,559
the TU IV co protein sequence shown in

310
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,980
blue with the optional read-through

311
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,838
domain shown as an orange dotted arrow a

312
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,700
lysine at position 150 in the Koch

313
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,200
protein was found cross linked to

314
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,000
another lysine at position 179 an

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,710
important limitation of PIR is that we

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,750
can't tell whether these cross-linked

317
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,480
lysines were on the same coat protein

318
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,370
monomer or on adjacent monomers which

319
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,019
limits our ability to use cross links

320
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,450
like this one for modeling although

321
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,879
they're still useful remarkably this

322
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,100
exact cross link was also found in pilar

323
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,779
v we can be certain that these cross

324
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,700
links are truly homologous to one

325
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,039
another because not only are the amino

326
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,900
acid positions similar but also the

327
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,149
peptides found cross-linked were nearly

328
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:07,899
identical differing by only a few amino

329
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:10,269
acids we also found a cross link between

330
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:13,509
two identical lysines found at position

331
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,399
179 in this case we know that this cross

332
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:18,338
link had to occur between two adjacent

333
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,740
CP monomers because this peptide only

334
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,300
occurs once in each molecule

335
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,769
we call this kind of cross-linked an

336
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:25,569
unambiguous homodimer

337
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,699
and this is the most useful kind of

338
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,260
cross-linked for modeling this

339
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,430
cross-linked was also perfectly

340
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,110
conserved in Pilar B so now that we have

341
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,599
some cross-linking data how do we use it

342
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,580
for modeling first I used a tool called

343
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,409
ight assert to predict the structure of

344
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,450
a single coat protein monomer by

345
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:45,669
homology modeling you can see the

346
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,680
structure here it consists of an S or

347
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:49,899
shell domain which forms the surface of

348
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,799
the capsid and in our domain which

349
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:55,360
interacts with RNA inside the capsid

350
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,250
next I model the multum or it's not

351
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,350
computationally feasible to model the

352
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,899
entire virion so instead we choose a

353
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,700
subset in this case the Koch protein

354
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,340
trimer which is the basic unit of the

355
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,450
capsid the classical trimer makes up one

356
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,330
face of the virion

357
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,129
I use sim duck to assemble the monomer

358
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,960
into plausible trimers in as many

359
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,850
different ways as it can while keeping

360
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,379
my cross-linked residues within a

361
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,300
certain linear distance of each other

362
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,299
based on the length of the PIR

363
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:24,129
cross-linking arm without the distance

364
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:26,319
constraints this analysis produces

365
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,830
hundreds of models but our cross-linking

366
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,780
data and narrows it down to only 77

367
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,759
finally I fed these 77 models into a

368
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,829
script which calculates the shortest

369
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,289
solvent accessible distance between the

370
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,240
cross-linked residues this is important

371
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:42,339
because linear distances often pass

372
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,769
through other parts of the protein which

373
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,480
our cross linker can't do you can think

374
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:48,399
of this as the difference between going

375
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,200
from here to Australia by tunneling

376
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
through the planet versus taking an

377
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,759
airplane over the planet's surface after

378
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
all of these calculations I ended up

379
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,950
with two trimer models that fit our

380
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,659
distance constraints so those two models

381
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,430
are shown here with the cross-linking

382
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,079
sites used for distance constraints

383
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,569
shown space filled in different colors

384
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,520
when we compare these to the most recent

385
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,010
peel RV trimer model from Stacy de

386
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,259
Blasio's paper we can see that model a

387
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:18,429
is more similar in shape but still isn't

388
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:20,439
an exact copy part of the reason we

389
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:21,729
obtain two rather different models for

390
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,680
the trimer is that there are many

391
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,379
different ways that monomers contact

392
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,479
each other in variants for example these

393
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,399
pink points are a three-fold axis of

394
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,259
symmetry at the centre of the classical

395
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,059
trimer whereas the yellow and green

396
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,939
contacts occur at the vert

397
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:39,189
it's very on our model changes depending

398
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:44,710
on where in the larger 3d structure we

399
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:46,990
think the cross links occurred model a

400
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,340
as well as Stacy's model fit best at the

401
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,930
six fold axis of symmetry as shown here

402
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,820
model B on the other hand places the

403
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:57,989
cross links at the threefold axis of

404
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,160
symmetry making this a true trimer model

405
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,560
so you might remember earlier I

406
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,600
mentioned this LH mutant from Stewart's

407
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,149
lab this is the one that he tested by

408
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,790
RNA spre tection and found that doesn't

409
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,620
it doesn't make stable variance so if we

410
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,589
highlight these mutated residues on

411
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,259
model a of the TYB tremor we can make

412
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,300
some predictions about why this might be

413
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:21,429
these two mutated residues are located

414
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:23,859
near the threefold axis of symmetry in

415
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,809
this model which is likely a really

416
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,690
important area for assembly and

417
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,789
stability of the trimer additionally the

418
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,400
histidine at position 108 has a

419
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:35,379
positively charged sidechain and is near

420
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,809
a negatively charged aspartate on the

421
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,669
neighboring monomer mutating this row

422
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:41,919
this histidine to prolene which is

423
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,979
hydrophobic would greatly disrupt the

424
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,449
salt bridge and favorable interaction

425
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,310
this is just one example of how a

426
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,450
structural model can be used to bridge

427
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:53,799
the gap between sequence and functions

428
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,900
so what's next the high degree of

429
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,689
conservation of structural cross links

430
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,730
between T u IV and PLR V provides

431
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,860
grounds for extension of these data to

432
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,420
other pool arrow viruses this is

433
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,400
important because it allows us to make

434
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,779
structural predictions for Polara virus

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,180
species that don't yet have

436
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:12,490
well-developed tool boxes including

437
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,049
newly emerging species we also of course

438
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,759
would like to be able to confirm our

439
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,859
predictions by solving some structures

440
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,259
and in fact we're doing this in

441
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,389
collaboration with josh Chaffee who's an

442
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:24,339
expert in x-ray crystallography and cryo

443
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,600
IAM here at Cornell he's in the audience

444
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:30,730
today and actually I did some early work

445
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,369
trying to solve the structure of the

446
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,990
Pilar V theory on by cryo a.m. but

447
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:37,139
didn't have time to overcome some of the

448
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,640
technical difficulties we had early on

449
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,230
Josh's lab is also trying to solve the

450
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,080
crystal structure of these structural

451
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,299
proteins Carl Schultz a grad student in

452
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,970
Josh's lab is actually very close to

453
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,849
solving the structure of

454
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,529
ecoute protein and he is also working

455
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:55,168
with Jenny Wilson who's a grad student

456
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,658
in our lab do you solve the structure of

457
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,009
part of the read-through domain and the

458
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,830
results from this project have been

459
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:02,908
really really exciting and if you want

460
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,349
to hear more about them I would

461
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:06,480
encourage you to look out for their

462
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:09,959
papers or to try to visit one of their

463
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,298
seminars on campus in the meantime these

464
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,730
PIR data are the only measurements we

465
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,819
have of structural proteins for polio

466
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,798
viruses and we expect these data will

467
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:22,259
continue to be important even as we get

468
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,179
closer to solving the structures this

469
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,250
paper is an example of a structure which

470
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,559
was obtained primarily through cryo a.m.

471
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,089
but utilized cross-linking data to

472
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:34,139
resolve an area that was otherwise

473
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:36,149
ambiguous before I move on I want to

474
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,159
mention one more thing although all of

475
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,720
the virus virus interactions I've talked

476
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,030
about so far have been between

477
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,329
structural proteins encoded by Orff's 3

478
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:47,190
and 5 PIR can also detect interactions

479
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:48,658
with any other viral proteins that are

480
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,110
present in our crude theory on

481
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:54,210
purifications and in fact my dataset

482
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:56,969
included two cross links between the t u

483
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,130
IV coat protein and a lysine located in

484
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,798
the peptidase domain of the viral p1

485
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,570
poly protein this interaction has never

486
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,579
been shown before and is interesting

487
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:08,129
because of a very old mystery in the

488
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,079
color of iris field this is an image of

489
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,330
a Western blot using an antibody that

490
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,220
recognizes structural proteins the far

491
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:17,279
left lane contains crude protein

492
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,569
extracted from PLR V infected plants you

493
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,029
can see that there's a clear band

494
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,529
visible for the coat protein at 23 kilo

495
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,569
daltons and for the full-length

496
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,730
read-through protein at about 80 kilo

497
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:29,369
daltons there's also a faint signal

498
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,788
between 50 and 70 kilo daltons which is

499
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:34,769
hard to see here however if we take the

500
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:36,569
same plant tissue and use it for a very

501
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,210
on purification we see a very different

502
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:40,649
story the co protein band remains as

503
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,450
expected but the full-length

504
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,390
read-through becomes difficult or

505
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,519
impossible to detect meanwhile the faint

506
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,190
bands we saw earlier resolved into a

507
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,619
handful of clear bands between 50 and 70

508
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,750
kilo daltons these bands are believed to

509
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,819
correspond to truncated forms of the

510
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,349
read-through protein for many years

511
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:00,418
researchers weren't certain whether

512
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:02,069
these truncations were an artifact of

513
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,990
the purification protocol

514
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:07,879
or whether they had some biological

515
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:10,528
function however this paper published in

516
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,570
2014 showed for the first time that the

517
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:15,000
truncated RTP did have a function

518
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:17,579
authors found that both the full length

519
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,589
and truncated forms of the RTP were

520
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:22,349
absolutely required for efficient

521
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:24,928
systemic movement in plants they

522
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:26,839
hypothesized that only the truncated RTP

523
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,860
is incorporated into the RIANZ

524
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,288
accounting for its enrichment in

525
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:34,079
purified preparations but that

526
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:36,179
unincorporated full-length RTP interacts

527
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,460
with other host proteins to facilitate

528
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:41,038
movement however the authors were not

529
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,370
able to determine how RTP truncation

530
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:47,099
occurred my finding of a cross link

531
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:49,109
between the CP or RTP and a lysine in

532
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,750
the peptidase domain of another viral

533
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:53,579
protein suggest the Polara biases may

534
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,179
perform this truncation using their own

535
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:59,009
viral protease this is supported by an

536
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,769
analysis of the locations of the

537
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:03,839
putative p1 cleavage sites in the RTP of

538
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,599
Calero viruses as well as others in the

539
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,278
family Lydia Verity in the Koch protein

540
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,678
and n-terminal half of the read-through

541
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:13,169
domain there are very few putative p1

542
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,120
cleavage sites however we see a massive

543
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:17,330
increase in the frequency of these sites

544
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,739
in the C terminal half of the RTD

545
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:22,678
cleavage at these sites would result in

546
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,690
truncated RTP s of 50 to 70 kilo daltons

547
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,740
which corresponds exactly with the sizes

548
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,360
that we see on a Western so in this

549
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,009
portion of the talk we found that these

550
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,009
structural cross links are conserved

551
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:36,690
between Pilar V and T u IV and we found

552
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:39,690
a cross link between a viral protease

553
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,028
domain and the co protein which led to

554
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,700
us to postulate a possible mechanism for

555
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:46,409
our TP truncation and we expect these

556
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,950
data to be useful in the future as we

557
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:51,059
integrate them with crystal structures

558
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,308
next I want to talk a little bit about

559
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:55,798
host virus interactions as I mentioned

560
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:58,230
previously PIR can also be used to probe

561
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,148
host virus interactions as these are

562
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,329
preserved during our crude virion

563
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:05,759
purification so when I first joined the

564
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,538
HEC lab Stacy de Blasio was working on

565
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,638
this project

566
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,528
she found interactions between pilar v

567
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:13,709
co protein or read-through protein and

568
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:15,650
32 different plant proteins this one is

569
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,590
my personal favorite it's a protein

570
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,180
bip which is a heat shock protein and

571
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,099
when Stacy modeled the interaction

572
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,100
between bip which is shown in blue and

573
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:26,449
the PLR Vico protein shown in green she

574
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:28,730
found that the Koch protein actually

575
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,460
fits perfectly into bits substrate

576
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,559
binding pocket here you can see a web

577
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,509
logo analyzing the conservation of the

578
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,970
bit binding site among the coat proteins

579
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:39,650
of other viruses in this family the size

580
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,380
of the letter corresponds to the degree

581
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,300
of conservation not only are the amino

582
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,910
acids that are directly involved in

583
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:49,159
binding highly conserved they're also

584
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,070
exactly the same motif that VIP is known

585
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,019
to bind to in host proteins indicating

586
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:57,169
that this motif has evolved in viruses

587
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:59,029
to mimic the host substrates tip this is

588
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,039
especially interesting because these

589
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:02,990
residues are a short but highly

590
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,420
conserved stretch of hydrophobic amino

591
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,630
acids in what is otherwise a highly

592
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,759
charged region of the co protein seeing

593
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,130
this we wanted to explore this protein

594
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,170
further and one of my first projects

595
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,090
here was to take this protein and a

596
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,430
selection of others found interacting

597
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:22,359
with PRB and to try to determine what

598
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,289
the purpose of this interaction was

599
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,089
fortunately there's already a very

600
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,250
well-established system in place for

601
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:31,009
gene silencing in mikoshi Anna Bentham

602
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,529
Jana our plant of choice this system

603
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:36,500
uses another virus tobacco R a virus or

604
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:39,049
T RV to silence genes by virus induced

605
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,180
gene silencing after inserting a

606
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,980
fragment of a plant gene black dip into

607
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,410
one of the halves of the trv genome

608
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,140
young plants are inoculated by agro

609
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,960
infiltration as the virus replicates and

610
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,500
move systemically homologous transcripts

611
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,329
are silenced in new tissue since we

612
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,359
never tried the system before we chose a

613
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:01,039
relatively simple approach to start I

614
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,719
inoculated plants with TRB containing a

615
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,369
silencing construct and allowed them to

616
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,269
grow for several weeks as shown on the

617
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:07,939
previous slide

618
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:10,879
I then inoculated several young leaves

619
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,220
with PL RB by agro infiltration waited a

620
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,350
few days and sampled the infiltrated

621
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,430
area by taking leaf bunches to check

622
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,459
titer by Eliza

623
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,590
because this assay samples locally

624
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,470
infected tissue we expect to be able to

625
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:28,429
assess changes in virion assembly virus

626
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,430
replication and host defense so here's

627
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,799
what we found when we

628
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,480
used figs to knock down BIP this is a

629
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,639
graph of Pilar VIII tighter in the

630
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,289
control plants which are infected with a

631
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,570
version of trv that shouldn't be

632
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:41,609
silencing anything and the plants where

633
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:43,500
BIP expression has been knocked down you

634
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,539
can see that there isn't much of an

635
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,849
effect at three days post infiltration

636
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,529
or dpi

637
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:51,569
however just two days later a Pilar be

638
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,940
tighter has fallen in the control plants

639
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:55,950
but risen in the BIP silenced plants

640
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,289
I tested eleven different hosts

641
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,970
interactors in this way and found that

642
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,980
knocking down eight of them affected

643
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:06,990
tighter during early or late stages of

644
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,940
local infection in later PIR experiments

645
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,809
I also found two cross links that we had

646
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,090
not seen before

647
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,829
between Pilar Vico protein or

648
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:16,129
read-through protein and a plant

649
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:18,599
Argonaut one or a go one protein

650
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,970
although stacy had previous evidence

651
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,490
that a go one Co immunoprecipitate swith

652
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,240
prv this was the first evidence we had

653
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,980
of a direct interaction before I go into

654
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,779
the follow-up experiments I want to take

655
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,049
a minute to talk about the role of ego

656
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,660
one and antiviral defense plants primary

657
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,839
defense against viruses is RNA silencing

658
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,450
during replication of Polara viruses and

659
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,949
most other plant viruses a

660
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,069
double-stranded RNA version of the viral

661
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,559
genome is temporarily produced this D s

662
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:51,480
RNA can be recognized by plant Dicer

663
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,819
proteins which chop it into pieces

664
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,690
the resulting fragments can be small

665
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:59,250
primary interfering RNAs or si RNAs 22

666
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,400
to 24 nucleotides long

667
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,529
these si RNAs are look loaded into

668
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,840
organic proteins including a go one

669
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:10,139
forming the RNA induced silencing

670
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,240
complex or risk this complex targets

671
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,280
homologous transcripts for silencing by

672
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,420
a cleavage or translational inhibition

673
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,639
to combat this defense most plant

674
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,470
viruses encode a silencing suppressor if

675
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,720
you remember from the very beginning of

676
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:28,170
my talk the silencing suppressor protein

677
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,670
for Polara viruses is called p 0 p 0 is

678
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,620
actually believed to function by

679
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,750
preventing assembly of the risk and

680
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:36,629
promoting degradation of a go one

681
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,569
protein this does not prevent generation

682
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:42,090
of primary si RNAs by Dicer but it does

683
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:43,109
keep a go one from using these si RNAs

684
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:46,949
to target other

685
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:49,079
transcripts based on this information we

686
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,960
can hypothesize that knocking down a

687
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,639
goal 1 will increase Pilar be tighter to

688
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,308
test this I came back to my Biggs

689
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,980
approach however this time I inoculated

690
00:26:56,308 --> 00:27:01,889
young plants with TRB and Pilar be at

691
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,110
the same time after 2 to 3 weeks when

692
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,299
both viruses had moved systemically I

693
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:09,119
took leaf punches from young leaves and

694
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:10,769
assessed titer again by Eliza because

695
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,869
this approach assays systemically

696
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:16,289
infected tissue it surveys a larger

697
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:18,298
portion of the virus life cycle here I'm

698
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,099
showing the effect of silencing a go one

699
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:23,099
on Pilar be tighter at two different

700
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:25,230
time points each dot represents one leaf

701
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,509
punch pink dots are from the control

702
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,849
plants infected with trv that shouldn't

703
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:31,740
be silencing anything whereas blue dots

704
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:35,069
are from plants infected with trv

705
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,589
targeting a go one while silencing a go

706
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:39,839
one did greatly increase Pilar V titer

707
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:42,058
in some samples you can see that there

708
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,178
was a huge amount of variation even

709
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:46,410
between samples taken from the same leaf

710
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:49,070
because of the enormous variability

711
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,058
between samples there was not a

712
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:54,480
statistically significant difference

713
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:56,250
between the treatments so after seeing

714
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,410
these data I wanted to see if I could

715
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,869
alter my samplings method to reduce

716
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,970
variability so reran the previous

717
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:04,589
experiment but this time I took three

718
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,690
punches from the left half of the leaf

719
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:09,000
which I've labeled as one two and three

720
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,190
this is a box-and-whisker plot show

721
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,319
variability and here the control plants

722
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,690
are in blue and the eggo one silenced

723
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,849
plants are in pink you can see the

724
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,940
variability is lower in some areas of

725
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:22,859
the leaf than others next i excised the

726
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,990
midrib of the same leaf as one sample

727
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:28,048
and took the entire remaining right half

728
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,609
of the leaf as another you can see that

729
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:32,190
the tighter and both of these samples

730
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,829
was pretty variable finally I took the

731
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,690
PD all of the leaf Peola be tighter was

732
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:38,460
by far at least variable in these

733
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,320
samples and a clear difference could be

734
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,819
seen between the treatments even though

735
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,539
I've sampled approximately the same

736
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:47,159
number of plants as before so with this

737
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,039
in mind I set out to do this experiment

738
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,230
one more time this time I took PDL

739
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,759
simples and I also tripled the number of

740
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,558
plants in each treatment because I

741
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,730
really was tired of doing this

742
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,799
experiment

743
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,809
so here you can see that silencing a go

744
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,819
one significantly increased feeler be

745
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:05,639
tighter relative to the control plants

746
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,740
you can also see that PRD tighter was

747
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,750
significantly more variable in the a go

748
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,880
one silenced plants than in the controls

749
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,650
you might remember that we saw this in

750
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,430
the very first set of experiments I did

751
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:19,620
too I also checked trv tighter you can

752
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,380
see that silencing a go one also clearly

753
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:24,509
increased steel RV RV tighter which

754
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,210
makes sense given that a go one has role

755
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:29,940
in general antiviral defense however

756
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:32,069
unlike PLR be trv tighter was similarly

757
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,769
variable in the control and a go one

758
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:36,269
silenced plants this suggests to me that

759
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,700
there's something unique about the

760
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:41,129
relationship between pol RV and a go one

761
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:48,569
beyond a go one's role in broad-spectrum

762
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:50,580
virus defense although I was incredibly

763
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:52,319
happy to see some low key values after

764
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:53,879
all of that optimization I've actually

765
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,339
saved what I think is the most

766
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,050
interesting result for last it's a

767
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:00,899
little bit hard to see in this photo but

768
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:03,539
infection with trv a go one alone that

769
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,240
is without pilar be present causes some

770
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:08,700
stunting and morphological defects this

771
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,730
isn't really surprising because a go one

772
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,450
is known to have a role in

773
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,849
transcriptional regulation during

774
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,740
development that said these plants are

775
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:20,159
still very much alive and will even

776
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,839
eventually flower pilar the infection on

777
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,390
the other hand causes very mild symptoms

778
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:27,480
even when our control version of trv is

779
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:30,180
present however if you combine TR v a go

780
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,049
one and Pilar V infection the plant

781
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,730
withers away and eventually dies to

782
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,869
understand why this might occur we need

783
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,690
to think about all the factors

784
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:42,569
influencing ao1 levels in these plants a

785
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:46,110
gawad protein is made by translation of

786
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:48,539
a go one mRNA when Pilar B is present it

787
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:51,449
produces p0 which promotes degradation

788
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:55,230
of a go one protein to facilitate virus

789
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,360
replication TR v a go one also works to

790
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,339
knock down a go one but it does so at

791
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,740
the transcript level from this

792
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:04,649
information we can hypothesize that TR v

793
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,650
a go one and Pilar be individually not a

794
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,019
go one down but not out however when

795
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,259
both are combined a go one drops to

796
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,539
leave

797
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,879
full levels this is supported by work

798
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,799
from other labs showing that a go one no

799
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,890
mutants in a rabid ops Asst are lethal

800
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,839
all of this suggests that puke glare

801
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,210
viruses must highly control P zero

802
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,429
activity knocking down a go one

803
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,309
increases virus tighter but if you knock

804
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,019
down too much the host dies this brings

805
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:34,230
me back around to the cross link between

806
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:36,509
PRV coat protein and a go one what if

807
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,660
the purpose of this interaction is to

808
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:41,609
protect a go one from p0 this would be

809
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,370
an elegant way to maintain a go one

810
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:47,849
homeostasis as far as tighter and likely

811
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:51,289
direction of p0 increase more CP is also

812
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:54,240
produced to counteract P zeros effect

813
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:57,240
this hypothesis has mixed support from

814
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,069
qPCR data the expression of a go one is

815
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,809
almost identical in control plants

816
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:03,329
regardless of whether or not the plants

817
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,950
are co-infected with P LRV meaning that

818
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:08,240
PL are the infection alone doesn't

819
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,680
significantly disrupt ego 1 homeostasis

820
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,079
however PL r B infection has a

821
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,500
noticeable effect in plants infected

822
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,689
with TR v targeting a go one in fact pRb

823
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,940
infection in these plants increases a go

824
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,100
one expression likely in an effort by

825
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,840
the plant to compensate for p0 z' effect

826
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,309
at the protein level although it's

827
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,679
important to note that this increased

828
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:32,339
expression may not result in increased

829
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,230
levels of a go one protein so this seems

830
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:36,209
to contradict our hypothesis the

831
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,120
presence of the co protein should shield

832
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,559
a go one from p0 especially because we

833
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,139
know from the previous data that the

834
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,669
titer is very high in these plants but

835
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,520
we already know that the coat protein

836
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,440
can't be 100% effective at preventing a

837
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,109
go one degradation or there would be no

838
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,940
point having p0 at all so maybe the

839
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:56,579
plants are more sensitive to even the

840
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,350
reduced action of p0 when I go one is

841
00:32:56,579 --> 00:33:04,079
already knocked down at the transcript

842
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:05,549
level I'm still working on testing this

843
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,379
hypothesis but I think there are

844
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,269
interesting implications for the data I

845
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,880
already have regardless of how the next

846
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:14,099
experiments turn out knocking down a go

847
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,250
one effects Pilar V tighter in a much

848
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:18,269
more complex way than tiara be tighter

849
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,099
suggesting that there's something unique

850
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:22,470
about the a go one Polara virus

851
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,639
relationship this is also supported by

852
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,029
the cross link we found

853
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,259
between coke protein and egg o1 we

854
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:30,329
definitely have evidence that the

855
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:32,400
strength of p0 is a balancing act

856
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:35,789
between suppressing host defense and

857
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,370
killing the host and a1 homeostasis is

858
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:40,980
not affected by p lr v infection alone

859
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:43,199
this led us to develop a hypothesis

860
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,279
about the function of the CPO 1

861
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,990
interaction so in this second half is

862
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,700
the talk we've assessed the effect of

863
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,890
knocking down some post interactors

864
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,720
during Pilar B infection and developed a

865
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,270
method to test these interactions using

866
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,400
virus induced gene silencing we also

867
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,349
found a direct interaction between a go

868
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,540
one and Keillor Beco protein or

869
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:05,339
read-through protein and we've seen

870
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:07,710
evidence that Polara viruses must

871
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:12,299
modulate p0 activity to prevent host

872
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:14,909
death okay so I know I just gave you 6

873
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,440
years worth of data in 30 minutes so I

874
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,780
want to wrap things up by reiterating

875
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,940
what I think are the main point findings

876
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,710
of this research in the first part of

877
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,200
the talk we found that the interaction

878
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,360
topologies of poliovirus coat proteins

879
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,339
are conserved which sounds relatively

880
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,559
trivial but is actually really important

881
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,960
because if the co protein interactions

882
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,179
don't change between Polara virus

883
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,949
species with different hosts this means

884
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,809
that these species specific differences

885
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:42,389
are not encoded in the co protein

886
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:43,980
topologies since Polara virus has moved

887
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:46,319
as virions and plants we can hypothesize

888
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,090
that host specificity must then be

889
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,880
encoded in the read-through domain by

890
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:52,980
the process of elimination we've also

891
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,780
demonstrated for the first time that PIR

892
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,550
successfully identifies direct

893
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,530
functionally relevant interactions

894
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,690
between Polara viruses and their hosts

895
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,210
this is also not trivial we knew a very

896
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,980
few direct host virus interactions

897
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,159
previously and finding these

898
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,990
interactions was a matter of luck or

899
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,119
screening using yeast two-hybrid or

900
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:14,099
other high-throughput approaches which

901
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,409
are very time and resource intensive and

902
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:19,319
don't always identify interactions that

903
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:21,299
are functionally relevant not only have

904
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,309
we found many new host interactions to

905
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,330
explore but we've also made a huge

906
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:29,070
technological leap forward in the field

907
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:31,079
finally i didn't show all of the data

908
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,910
for this but in my biggs experiments I

909
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,679
found that knocking out most of the host

910
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:37,480
proteins that we identified as

911
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,639
interacting with Galera viruses by PIR

912
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,740
actually increased valera virus titer

913
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:44,440
this was a really surprising results

914
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,629
because we were expecting to find at

915
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,940
least an equal number of interactions

916
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:52,240
that are important for virus replication

917
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,650
or movement as for defense there are a

918
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,348
couple of ways that we can explain this

919
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,088
it's possible that plants really just

920
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,490
throw everything that they have at

921
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:02,920
viruses to try to prevent replication

922
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:04,838
and so most host virus interactions

923
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,630
actually represent the plant's attempts

924
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:11,049
to defend itself alternatively we know

925
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:13,240
that circuitous is that the circulat of

926
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,430
transmission the mode of Calero viruses

927
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:17,858
requires prolonged a third feeding for

928
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:19,539
acquisition and transmission while it's

929
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:21,699
beneficial for viruses with other

930
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:23,679
transmission modes to sacrifice their

931
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:26,529
hosts in an effort to produce as many

932
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,569
baryons as possible Polara viruses must

933
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,940
keep their hosts alive and attractive to

934
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,500
affix maybe the reason we see an

935
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,690
increase in tighter when we knock out

936
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,949
most in our host interaction partners is

937
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,050
because the function of these

938
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:41,588
interactions is actually to limit virus

939
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,880
replication to wrap things up real quick

940
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:44,710
I want to talk briefly about some

941
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,900
potential future applications and

942
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,429
impacts for this research I'm really

943
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,260
interested to see how these data could

944
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:52,000
be applied to other non model Polara

945
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,550
virus species including some of the

946
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,079
newer emerging viruses these types of

947
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,880
data could also be useful for the

948
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,440
development of interdiction molecules

949
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,030
which are molecules specifically

950
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,059
designed to interfere with biological

951
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,710
process Angela Cruz a grad student in

952
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,779
our lab is actually working on the

953
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,608
development of interdiction molecules to

954
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,769
prevent transmission of the bacteria

955
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:13,059
that causes citrus greening disease so

956
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:14,619
if you'd like to learn more about that

957
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:17,769
then you can look for her papers and

958
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:19,240
seminars I also think that this

959
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,769
technology has some potentially

960
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,709
interesting applications for gene

961
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:25,780
editing and particularly in the

962
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,150
development of resistant cultivars so

963
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,680
this is a paper from 2011 detailing the

964
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,599
development of potato cultivars

965
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,000
resistant to three strains of potato

966
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,740
virus y which is a podium is thats one

967
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,800
of the most important potato pathogens

968
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:41,318
today like polio viruses PBY has a

969
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,289
single-stranded RNA genome and encodes a

970
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:46,179
viral genome leaked protein or vpg which

971
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:48,818
binds to the five prime end of the viral

972
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:51,339
genome DPG then binds to a host

973
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:53,800
elongation factor in this case

974
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,260
for ii to recruit a host ribosomal

975
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,990
complex to initiate production of viral

976
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,510
proteins previous screens had identified

977
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:03,399
AI f-4e alleles and other plant species

978
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,530
which were fully functional but to

979
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,780
contain small polymorphisms that

980
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:10,540
prevented binding to vpg conferring

981
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,850
resistance to po d viruses in the study

982
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,619
the authors use targeted mutagenesis to

983
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,989
transfer those polymorphisms in the

984
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:19,150
potato the resulting transgenic lines

985
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:21,039
are numbered here on this graph with the

986
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,380
wild-type and other control lines on the

987
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,909
far right you can see that all of the

988
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,579
transgenic lines were almost completely

989
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:29,889
resistant to all three tested strains of

990
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:30,549
PBY whereas the controls were highly

991
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:34,000
susceptible

992
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,650
I believe that PIR guided modeling has

993
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,809
the potential to achieve the same end

994
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,970
result for polio viruses but in a much

995
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:41,889
shorter time frame we have already

996
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,839
established that PIR successfully

997
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:45,730
identifies functionally relevant host

998
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,039
virus interactions which is the first

999
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:51,429
step in developing a resistance strategy

1000
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,110
like this we can also use PIR data to

1001
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,940
model the interaction between the host

1002
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,430
and viral proteins predicting where the

1003
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,960
viral protein binds if this binding site

1004
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:00,730
is located in an area that can be

1005
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,829
mutated without affecting the host

1006
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,449
proteins native function we can perform

1007
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:06,069
gene editing to knock out the

1008
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,169
interaction without affecting the

1009
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,059
proteins native function this is

1010
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,220
especially important because many of the

1011
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:14,829
host proteins we found interacting with

1012
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:16,929
kill our V and T u IV have important

1013
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:19,210
roles in metabolism and development and

1014
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:21,339
can't be knocked down or out without

1015
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:26,380
causing significant and sometimes lethal

1016
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:28,210
effects and this is only the beginning

1017
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,730
now that we finally have the ability to

1018
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,070
more directly explore structural biology

1019
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,719
and protein protein interactions we can

1020
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,280
try to tackle some of the oldest and

1021
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,129
most important questions in Lutie

1022
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,110
ovarian biology how do colera viruses

1023
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,559
interact with their hosts can we

1024
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:45,880
interrupt virus replication or movement

1025
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,949
what's the structure of the polio virus

1026
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,990
very on and what governs its assembly

1027
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:51,939
can we design molecules to prevent

1028
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:53,608
assembly or disrupt host virus

1029
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,889
interactions

1030
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:58,440
how do Polara viruses cause symptoms and

1031
00:39:55,889 --> 00:40:00,598
yield losses in host plants can we use

1032
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,880
this information to reduce the impact of

1033
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,739
these viruses and finally atha

1034
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,200
transmission is largely a black box

1035
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:09,568
application of PIR to a papyrus

1036
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,338
complexes could greatly helped us to

1037
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:14,190
understand circulat of transmission of

1038
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:16,409
these and other viruses so overall I

1039
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,119
think these data and this technology are

1040
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:20,338
really exciting and give us the ability

1041
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,160
to leap years ahead in our understanding

1042
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:25,498
of klara virus biology and I hope I've

1043
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,960
convinced you of that too before I take

1044
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:31,139
questions I'd like to take just like one

1045
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,608
minute to to thank a couple of the

1046
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:35,009
people who have made all of this

1047
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:37,469
possible so I've been fortunate to have

1048
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:39,630
many amazing mentors in my time here my

1049
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,818
adviser michelle tech has been a

1050
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:44,818
constant support source of support and

1051
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:47,338
inspiration anyone who has met her knows

1052
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:50,429
that her seemingly endless energy and

1053
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:52,170
capacity to generate new ideas is truly

1054
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:54,748
incredible and from Cold Spring Harbor

1055
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,608
to many government shutdowns we've been

1056
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:58,858
through a lot together and I'm so

1057
00:40:56,608 --> 00:41:01,498
grateful to have been able to take this

1058
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:03,838
journey with her I also want to thank my

1059
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:06,028
committee all of whom are amazing and

1060
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:09,239
I'm so honored to have been able to have

1061
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:11,219
their feedback also Stacy de Blasio laid

1062
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,108
the foundation for so much of this work

1063
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,959
and has been an incredible sounding

1064
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:18,420
board friend and teacher and I could not

1065
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,099
have done any of this without her and to

1066
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,900
my many other mentors who have helped me

1067
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:23,999
to become a better scientist a better

1068
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,358
teacher and a better communicator thank

1069
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:29,219
you I know everyone says this but I

1070
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,739
truly have the best collaborators in the

1071
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:33,568
world not only Jim Stewart and Josh who

1072
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,150
I mentioned previously but also a very

1073
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:39,329
broad and very neat Ziegler graf who

1074
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,680
enabled all of the work with tu ivy my

1075
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:43,349
husband Dave has been my rock through

1076
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,058
even the hardest days in the lab not

1077
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:46,980
only has he been unwaveringly

1078
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:48,569
supportive and encouraging but he has

1079
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,789
personally contributed to this project

1080
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:53,730
through many late nights helping me

1081
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,349
inoculate plants I would also not be

1082
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,778
here today without my family especially

1083
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,670
my sister Midori and my parents pictured

1084
00:41:57,778 --> 00:42:01,588
here in their adorable Christmas attire

1085
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,659
who have been a constant source of

1086
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:05,248
strength inspiration and love you guys

1087
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:06,690
are the best and I'm so lucky to have

1088
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:08,549
you

1089
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,710
finally I'm so grateful to have met so

1090
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,750
many brilliant kind and creative people

1091
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,150
here and I especially want to thank

1092
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,400
Angela Cruz who has had the misfortune

1093
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,990
of spending so much time with me that

1094
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,849
we've started taking on one another

1095
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:26,338
sander isms she's she's picked me back

1096
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,690
up so many times after I fallen and I

1097
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:30,869
truly don't know what I would do without

1098
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,450
her so thank you all of you for your

1099
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,030
support and for listening today it means

1100
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:49,139
a lot to me and at this point I think we

1101
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:51,450
have time for a couple of questions so

1102
00:42:49,139 --> 00:43:01,009
I'll start by taking a question from

1103
00:42:51,449 --> 00:43:03,838
Ithaca Andie protein had a modulating

1104
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,640
degradation of a go and you showed in

1105
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,039
your model or you show your data that

1106
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,710
says if you have a big knockdown plant

1107
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:12,539
that's inoculated with the virus you see

1108
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,400
this like dead plant and you're saying

1109
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,369
that that could be due to take is going

1110
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,970
to lower the threshold for so what do

1111
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:21,500
you think would happen if you

1112
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:21,500
overexpress the protein or

1113
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:30,568
yeah so Annie was talking about this ago

1114
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:32,760
one story and my hypothesis for the co

1115
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:36,059
protein interaction protecting a go one

1116
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,400
from p0 and was wondering if maybe if we

1117
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:40,199
express over express the co protein or

1118
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,139
did something else to kind of mess with

1119
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,328
this system if we could maybe provide

1120
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,529
some support for this hypothesis and

1121
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:48,990
that's actually is something that I'm

1122
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:51,060
working on I'm using something called a

1123
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:53,159
silencing suppression assay which I just

1124
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:55,980
barely didn't get done in time for this

1125
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,929
talk but basically I'm trying to see if

1126
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,349
I can over express the coat protein and

1127
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:13,259
see a difference in how well a go one is

1128
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:15,390
degraded by p0 Josh yes do you know how

1129
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,940
that maps to our structural data like

1130
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:20,400
there's a correspond to where we work we

1131
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,619
see structurally or you know

1132
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,559
does it like to the point where we have

1133
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:28,259
structure I don't remember off the top

1134
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,450
of my head I have looked at that and I I

1135
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:31,349
can't remember what the what the results

1136
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:33,808
were but that would be really

1137
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:43,289
interesting to check to see where those

1138
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:46,559
putative cleavage sites are distribution

1139
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:48,749
right it drops off very pretty strongly

1140
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,670
at a certain point my question is you

1141
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:52,348
know we have a structure of the internal

1142
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,539
part of it so does that map to where

1143
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:56,789
that drops off and what you know what we

1144
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,990
need for structure that's all well and

1145
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:00,089
it would I think it would also be

1146
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:02,399
interesting to see whether the putative

1147
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:05,869
cleavage sites that we do see in the NR

1148
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,400
TD are maybe protected in the structure

1149
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:11,160
so maybe they could be present but

1150
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,599
aren't being recognized by p1 which

1151
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:17,998
could explain why we never see cleavage

1152
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:20,519
there so yeah definitely are there any

1153
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:27,298
questions from Geneva or other remote

1154
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:30,088
audiences yeah I think we're about out

1155
00:45:27,298 --> 00:45:32,099
of time but if anyone has any other

1156
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:38,159
questions feel free to come and grab me

1157
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:39,960
afterwards so thank you guys this has

1158
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:45,710
been a production of Cornell University

1159
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,710
on the web at cornell edu
