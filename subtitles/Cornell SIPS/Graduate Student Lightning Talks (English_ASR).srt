1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,440
University hey yeah so I work with um

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,039
John Luke Yanik and Virginia Moore on

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,719
two different intercropping projects um

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,118
and intercropping is just when you grow

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,879
two species together in the same time or

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,879
space and there's um some cool benefits

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,759
of intercropping um that have been

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,000
described in literature including

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,720
increased biodiversity and environmental

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,719
service capacity of a system um reduce

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,039
Pest and disease you spread the risk um

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,079
of like natural disasters and still

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,000
getting some kind of yield um there's

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,320
the potential for Niche differentiation

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,079
and um the compatibility facilitation

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,439
effects but um for these to work there's

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,198
a need for a lot of agronomic in

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,799
Innovations including um planting and

20
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,119
harvesting processing those types of

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,878
things and it also presents a novel

22
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,839
environment to breed for breed for since

23
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,920
um the species must perform well with

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,920
another species in the system and um not

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,519
just by itself um so we may need to look

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,799
at both genotypes when we're breeding

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,798
for these

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,118
systems um so intercropping two species

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,239
together that can be a cover crop with

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,239
cash crop or it can be like what I'm

31
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,118
working on with two different cach crops

32
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,039
together and they can be configured in

33
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,000
different ways like in mixtures think

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,240
about like broadcasting just um

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,519
different species of seeds they can be

36
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:34,199
in alleys with um one crop between rows

37
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,560
of trees in rows or in strips and the

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,879
way I'm doing it with the intermediate

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,399
we grass Alfalfa is alternating rows and

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,839
with the oats and peas with um John

41
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,320
Luke's lab it's mixed within Rose so the

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,200
oats and peas are together in the Rose

43
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,398
as you can see in the picture and um

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,960
some of the preliminary results I'm

45
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,519
going to show today are for the oats and

46
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,319
PE project um but I did want to bring up

47
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,359
the intermediate we grass alphalpha

48
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,398
intercrop um because it's pretty cool as

49
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,200
well and it's also a dual use system so

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,759
you can um the farmer has the option at

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
least a little more option on the

52
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,719
markets that they go to where you can

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,719
Harvest for grain and

54
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,759
forage um yeah so this o1p project

55
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:22,958
included 48 different oat accessions and

56
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,878
12 different p accessions and that's

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,640
over 500 different combinations if we're

58
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,280
evaluating um them in inner crop so

59
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,639
they're spread across six different

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,318
locations

61
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,958
um where each possible combination is

62
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:39,000
represented at least in one of these

63
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:42,199
locations and um we had two different

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,519
types of peas the forage

65
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:48,318
which is this coming up on the screen no

66
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
okay so the the forage is on the far um

67
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,799
an example the forage is on the far side

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,599
and then a field or grain type P is the

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,840
one in the middle um you did this

70
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,759
there's like a difference in morphology

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,360
um where the field type has a lot more

72
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:05,199
Leaf area it tends to be taller and the

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,840
grain type is um more Compact and has

74
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,560
more of its tendrils so this the idea is

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,479
that these difference in morphology um

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,439
could maybe have an influence um in the

77
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:19,840
competitive interactions in an inner

78
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:22,120
crop and um yeah so this year from New

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,519
York here's kind of some box plots of

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,840
what the biomass looked like when we

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,920
sampled at four different time points

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,158
throughout the season and um we found

83
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,878
that the oat biomass in a plot was a lot

84
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,479
higher than what we got for the biomass

85
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,039
of the peas but that there's no

86
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,359
difference between um the O biomass on

87
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,438
whether it's with a field P or Forge P

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,040
or even in the monoculture plots that we

89
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,719
did um where I guess I should explain

90
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,959
that a little bit it's like there's this

91
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,479
intercrop with a specific oat accession

92
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,400
and a specific PE accession and then

93
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,158
right next to it we had that same oat

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,120
planted in a monoculture um so what we

95
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,719
found is no preliminary at least um that

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,959
that interaction for biomass was not

97
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:09,039
significant um and then for grain yield

98
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,759
I used mixed linear models and did find

99
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,199
that certain genotypes were significant

100
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,399
covariant for both the oat the p and the

101
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,120
total yield of the plot um I do need to

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,040
do more analysis on this but it

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,439
indicates that there are differences in

104
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,439
intercrop um

105
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,758
compatibility um to evaluate how

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,759
genotypes perform with any genotype of

107
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,319
the other species we look at the general

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
mixing ability and for this I use beian

109
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,240
generalized linear regression um which

110
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,639
is a multivariant with a multivariant

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,319
model um so I can look at the both the

112
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,079
outcome of the oat yield and the PE

113
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:48,279
yield with um multiple sources of

114
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:51,319
variation from um location block within

115
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,959
year and location and the hood accession

116
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,800
the p accession and then year by itself

117
00:04:53,959 --> 00:05:00,120
um so what we're seeing here is in the

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,199
top one it's the oat genotype on the

119
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,639
x-axis that genotype effect on that oats

120
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,240
yield and then the P that it's with any

121
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,079
of the P that it's with um is on the Y

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,439
AIS um so in Orange we see that there

123
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:20,719
are some oat genotypes that have a

124
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:23,439
positive effect um on positive effect on

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,880
the both the oat and the PE yield in

126
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,839
that plot and the same we see that there

127
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,079
are some that for p genotypes doing the

128
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,079
same thing

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,520
um I was also curious on the competitive

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,400
interaction between the specific oats

131
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:44,399
gen oat excession and P excession so um

132
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,000
here what I did was looked at um that

133
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:51,198
oat in crop and the monoculture right

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,360
beside it for Oat yield and found that

135
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,120
some combinations the oat yield was

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,840
higher in inner crop than it was in the

137
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,720
monoculture rided and then some

138
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,599
combinations that oat um had a lower

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,960
yield than it was in the in crop um

140
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,560
again showing that there are differences

141
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,560
um in these

142
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,879
compatibilities um so the these plots

143
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:17,000
are the um specific combinations from

144
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,079
Illinois and New York so that's why not

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,240
every combination is shown as a color

146
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,359
here um not every location had these

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,560
monocultures to compare um but yeah the

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,560
the reds are like the the more red it is

149
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,360
the lower the oat yield in intercrop was

150
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,759
and compared to its monoculture and then

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,038
greens are where the in crop oat yield

152
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,280
was higher than its

153
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,719
monoculture um comparing this to like

154
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,879
these General um General mixing ability

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,000
idea saw that there are PS like Maxum

156
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,839
where no matter what it's with it has um

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,720
a negative effect on that oat yield um

158
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,839
and there's some also that are are at

159
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,639
least more positive um so excited to

160
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,198
work more on this and um

161
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,000
acknowledgements I am very thankful to

162
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,720
be in two great Labs with John Luke and

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,478
Jenny um our field crew for this o and

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,360
PE project is Peter Hyde Mir is doing um

165
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,560
very similar work with winter oats and

166
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,560
peas and we have a great undergrad um

167
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,598
Adrien who's been with us for a couple

168
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,519
Summers now um I also got great feedback

169
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,800
on this um from joint lab meetings with

170
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,839
the Soros lab so thank you for that um

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
and get a lot of field help from their

172
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,799
field crew of David and Jason um the

173
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Odin P project has a lot of

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,038
collaborators with um Patrick hu at the

175
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,079
USDA Vermont Martin wolf at University

176
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:39,639
of Alabama Juan David Alvarez at

177
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:42,240
Illinois um CZ Chone at University of

178
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,720
Wisconsin C mili in Minnesota and melan

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Cafe at South Dakota um and then the

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,680
more lab our field crew is um jly Hansen

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,158
Jamie and Ryan Crawford and Jesse Chavez

182
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,800
um and that Al Alfa intermediate project

183
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,719
is funded by the AL Alpa and Forge

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,960
research program and um part of that

185
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,960
project was done um previously by

186
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,478
someone who

187
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,038
graduated um with their masters in 2024

188
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:12,279
Megan Williams and we have collaborators

189
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,279
listed for there as well

190
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:19,240
thanks any are there any environmental

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,720
uh predictors of these

192
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,478
compatibilities um are there any

193
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,520
environmental factors for the

194
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,680
compatibility I haven't looked into that

195
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:34,679
yet I do need to calculate genotype I

196
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,479
environmental factors and um we can get

197
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,239
like climate data but we haven't yet so

198
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,560
those are future things

199
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,519
thanks um I was wondering for like the

200
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,359
one variety where you saw it just kind

201
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,278
of decreased the O yield across the

202
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,320
board are you interested in looking

203
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,720
further to try and figure out why like

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,680
that's variety is decreasing the yield

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
or this kind of outside the scope of

206
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,719
your

207
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,440
research um yeah so I showed that the

208
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,720
one P Max on P had an overall like

209
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,600
negative effect on whatever oat it was

210
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:16,000
with um and so am I interested in why

211
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:18,720
that might be um not right now

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,720
um maybe I'm still I'm still figuring

213
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,720
out where I'm going with my thesis work

214
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,639
so um yeah more interested

215
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,360
in more General like interactions but

216
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,639
yeah totally um it is it looks like a

217
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,278
forage type but I didn't see any like

218
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,480
difference between like forage and field

219
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,600
so not quite sure what that morphology

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,879
or what that

221
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,959
is yeah like what other phenotypes um

222
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:49,278
are we looking at we um took height

223
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:53,359
measurements and um emergence counts and

224
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:56,000
maturity um notes as well and then Peter

225
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,720
hide also flies a drone um quite

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
frequently so um we have multispectral

227
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,560
data that I'm not working with but we'll

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,519
have that to compare as well so good

229
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,319
afternoon

230
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,440
everyone so can you hear me good

231
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,240
afternoon everyone my name is BR ConEd

232
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,680
and I'm with the backa lab this

233
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,079
afternoon I'll be talking about

234
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,559
exploring tradeoffs between cold and D

235
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:22,278
tolerance in trypto

236
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,679
loides and so we picked these two

237
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:28,838
stresses because drought has been known

238
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,159
to be one of the single most limiting

239
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,560
factor affecting maze production in the

240
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:37,078
US and then also by building Frost

241
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,679
resilience crops we'll be able to

242
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:43,359
improve um yields by 10% and also reduce

243
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,599
our Reliance on nitrogen by

244
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,600
20% and then based on Research there are

245
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,800
some similar shed Pathways between these

246
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,320
two stresses but then there's still a

247
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,919
knowledge gap between the tradeoffs and

248
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,760
then the synergies that exist between

249
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,679
these two stresses and that is where

250
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,039
this research comes in

251
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,120
and so it got me thinking about how

252
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,919
certain maze relatives are able to adapt

253
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,000
to these two stresses whilst maze

254
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:14,039
doesn't have that flexibility and so I

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,919
was thinking could it be that they

256
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:19,559
possess certain specific genetic and

257
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,240
physiological adaptations or it could be

258
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,479
due to

259
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,278
modifications that helps them to um

260
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,879
better Express their genes or their

261
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,240
metabolic pathways or their genomic

262
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,240
structure

263
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,600
and then we settled I settled on

264
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,480
tripsacum because it is it's been known

265
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,639
to be the closest peral relative of maze

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,800
with frost tolerance and then

267
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:49,519
evolutionists believe that about 500,000

268
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,799
years ago Maze and tracom diverged from

269
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,440
each other leading to some lots of

270
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:58,078
functions in in maze that are still

271
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,959
present in tripsacum and so tripsacum

272
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,679
tends to serve was like a reservoir for

273
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,278
some good trades that could be used to

274
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,278
transform

275
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:16,040
Maze and so the data sets that I intend

276
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:19,399
to use to capture to test my hypothesis

277
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,480
include some samples of tripsacum that

278
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:26,600
were sampled by Denise cage and Nick

279
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,560
leak in Al lab um they were samples

280
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,800
across the US

281
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,159
and then crossed with each other to

282
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,278
generate f1s and then left to open

283
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:41,198
pollinates to generate

284
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:43,278
f2s and by observation we realize that

285
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,719
there are some of them that have that

286
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,559
are Frost tolerant and others that are

287
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,160
drought tolerant and so we have the

288
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:54,198
right population to do this work and

289
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,799
then also another data set that will be

290
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,479
involved in this study is a tripsacum

291
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,838
population panel from a panan project

292
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,079
that was conducted in collaboration with

293
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
our

294
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,720
lab so to test my first hypothesis I

295
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,278
have eight high-fi long G assemblies

296
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,079
that I'll be assembling to create a PhD

297
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,679
after which I would use that PhD to

298
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,278
impute on hundreds of tripom samples

299
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,559
from the panan project and by doing that

300
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,439
I intend to perform an environmental G

301
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:32,078
study to identify some drought and cod

302
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,560
plusi and then also use a DNA language

303
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,559
model to identify some causal

304
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,639
variance so my eight genotypes that I

305
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,078
selected I tried as much as possible to

306
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,079
capture enough

307
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:50,638
diversity within um the population that

308
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:55,559
we the populations that we have and so I

309
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:58,759
used this MDS plot and then selected My

310
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:03,518
AG genotypes and so I have my Hi-Fi long

311
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,519
GRE now that I am currently

312
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:11,600
assembling and for my next um hypothesis

313
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,958
test on the comparative expression

314
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,759
analysis of hold and drought myself

315
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:21,039
together with um Lara bindes who is a

316
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:25,480
postdoc in our lab I've been screening

317
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:29,240
tripsacum and the cold and the cold and

318
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,159
so what we we've been doing is to have

319
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,120
some batches that are cold acclimated

320
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:38,278
firstest that is we move them after

321
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,839
planting them we move them to the cold

322
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,958
chamber at 10° Celsius during the day

323
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,160
and then 6° Celsius during the night

324
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,198
after which they are moved to the

325
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:51,879
freezer at minus 6 deges and during this

326
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:54,198
time points we sample um tissue for RNA

327
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,879
sequencing and then the non-cold

328
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,439
acclimation batch we just moved planted

329
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,159
them in the greenhouse and then move

330
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,920
them straight to the freezer and also do

331
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,919
tissue collection at these time

332
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,440
points another cool thing that I also

333
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:15,120
did together with my Pi this summer was

334
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,519
to harvest um tripsacum and so if you've

335
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,560
ever worked with tripsacum you would

336
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,919
know that it's very tedious to do they

337
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,439
tend to shatter and lose their seeds on

338
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:28,318
on the field so if you want to um get

339
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,639
enough Harvest from your seed you would

340
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,599
have to try 1 me that end up being

341
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:38,839
extremely tedious so we tried out this

342
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,040
protocol whereby we cut the head some um

343
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,160
tripsacum seed heads together with the

344
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,000
connes and then repl them in Mason jaar

345
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,480
filled with

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,879
water and so initially we were very

347
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,560
skeptical about this because we didn't

348
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,799
know if it was going to affect the

349
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,119
viability of the seeds

350
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,519
and so far so good we realized that

351
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,799
after performing our germination test

352
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,560
when you DEH hold the seat you have

353
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,159
about

354
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:11,359
54% um seats germinating however the on

355
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,198
the whole SE T to have like lower

356
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,800
germination germination rates which is

357
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:17,799
pretty cool especially for

358
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,759
triple and so for my next step I the

359
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,399
seeds that we obtained from this um

360
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:31,199
summer summer seed Harvest will be used

361
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,958
to set up my ad tolerance experiments

362
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,799
which will be conducted in the bti

363
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,799
phenotyping

364
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,000
facility yep and so that brings me to

365
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:45,078
the end of my presentation I would

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,399
however like to thank the bua lab

367
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:50,799
for assisting me during this research I

368
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,360
have bagged a whole lot of people and I

369
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,240
would like to thank them specifically

370
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,199
for that because I'm I'm not even done

371
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,159
with that and then also I also like to

372
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,519
thank my committee members for providing

373
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,879
insights into this research and then

374
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,599
also my funding sources the slum

375
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,839
foundation for supporting my doctoral

376
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,879
journey and then the usds for supporting

377
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:16,958
this

378
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,959
project thank

379
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,959
you

380
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,279
yes

381
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm your set of relation can you explain

382
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,319
why that specific U reading team the

383
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,080
process

384
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,079
Chosen and

385
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,720
maybe um okay so with

386
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,200
Crossing I said that there were some

387
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,160
that were drought tolerant and then

388
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,000
there are some that were freezing

389
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,038
tolerance and so by Crossing you end up

390
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,200
um Crossing some some of these traits

391
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,839
together and so moving on to um the F2

392
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,600
Generation you would have these Straits

393
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:01,918
segregating within the population and so

394
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:06,279
yeah that is why we have the F2 and then

395
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,280
the f1's population you're

396
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,519
welome um so I saw you collected a lot

397
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,319
of your samples from like lower

398
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,918
latitudes in the US you find that they

399
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,439
grow a bit differently or a bit less um

400
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,600
when they're put up here in New York

401
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,720
state

402
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:29,158
um I wouldn't say they grow up

403
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,240
differently but then they have so I know

404
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,919
that the lower parts are like much more

405
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,640
warmer and so there are some that

406
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,320
collections from that side have proved

407
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,038
that they are F tolerance being here

408
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,038
under controlled

409
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:47,000
environment yeah so hi everyone yeah I'm

410
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:50,359
a third year in uh VTech plavsky lab but

411
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,880
um I did a rotation project with Holly

412
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:54,639
um and this is how it started so I'll

413
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,080
I'm actually going to be speaking about

414
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
my work with Holly but at the end I will

415
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,279
just warn you there's going to be an

416
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,159
abrupt

417
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,200
change I just have a couple slides about

418
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,720
text

419
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,600
work so how this study arose I feel like

420
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,839
it really started in my undergrad like

421
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,439
when we would be in the field uh for

422
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,319
long days and we would just talk about

423
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,038
anything and a lot of times we talk

424
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,439
about career versus family and the

425
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,720
challenges with that uh and then also uh

426
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,759
just

427
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,319
observing a more diverse uh graduate

428
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,279
student population and faculty

429
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,480
population it really made me wonder like

430
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,079
where all of the women

431
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,200
go

432
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:42,319
so uh then since I don't have any uh

433
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,240
experience with social science work or

434
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:48,720
uh just understanding

435
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,960
Parenthood I decided to read literature

436
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,919
and so the topics in bold are what

437
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,400
really like stood or kept standing out

438
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,200
um Parenthood kept standing out and then

439
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,759
also in literature they said that the

440
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,600
solution was

441
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,759
policy so what's missing from the

442
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,959
literature is that there's nothing on

443
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,839
this topic even in plant science in

444
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,360
general but for sure not plant braing

445
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,678
and then the studies either have women

446
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,479
or

447
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,440
men um and then also most of these

448
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,960
studies only have like five or eight

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,960
respondents and I was able to get 31

450
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,960
respondents way more than I uh

451
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,440
wanted and then also uh so I I

452
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,960
originally actually wanted to interview

453
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,960
the people that had left the field but

454
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,120
that data is either not there or it's

455
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,038
confidential so it made me uh realize

456
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:46,359
that I have to collect my own data so

457
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:49,480
this kind of turned into a qualitative

458
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,639
project and I landed on the question of

459
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,440
understanding how care responsibilities

460
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,600
and gender have shaped ATT 10ed track

461
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,200
faculty's academic career in FP

462
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:02,480
breedy so to go over a few

463
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,679
definitions I wanted to broaden only

464
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,000
talking about Parenthood and I asked uh

465
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,278
the respondents also about like Elder

466
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,720
Care caring for another person in their

467
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,919
family and also

468
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,319
themselves another definition I want to

469
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,840
go over is gender Norms so gender Norms

470
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,359
are the social expectation and rules

471
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,319
that dictate how people should behave

472
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,158
and express themselves based on their

473
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,038
gender this is usually developed during

474
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,320
adolescence and

475
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,839
um can be influenced over time and also

476
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,319
by

477
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,639
culture so to go over the process a

478
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,678
little bit because I'm going to assume

479
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,360
that most people have not done this

480
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,759
before uh the first step is to develop

481
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,558
the project and kind of figure out who I

482
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:52,278
want to interview what questions I want

483
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:54,960
to ask uh so I uh write up forms like an

484
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:57,119
interview guide uh an email that I would

485
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,679
send out to people and I submit all

486
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:03,599
these forms to the uh IRB for

487
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,080
approval uh this is also a TDS process

488
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,119
but once it's

489
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,119
approved then I can actually reach out

490
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,439
to the

491
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,599
participants and then I conduct a one

492
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,278
hour semi structured interview uh so

493
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,879
that means that I can start out with one

494
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:22,679
question and then I can ask follow-up

495
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,320
questions that the IRB is not aware of

496
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,000
so the questions or the big topics that

497
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,839
I asked about were like what are your

498
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,278
care responsibilities

499
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,839
uh what's like how do they affect your

500
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,200
work environment and were there any

501
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,319
policies

502
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,519
involved and then after I uh have the

503
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,839
interviews I verify that the recordings

504
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:46,119
match the transcripts and then after

505
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:48,798
that I code the transcripts with Max qda

506
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,038
uh which is a software to uh

507
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,480
systematically analyze I think it's

508
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,879
probably the most similar to um someone

509
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,240
like phenotyping for disease resistance

510
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,720
they come up with a standard first and

511
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,919
then kind of go based off of that and so

512
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,960
that's kind of what this is doing

513
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,799
here and eventually um after a few ODS

514
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,798
of coding I develop a code book and that

515
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:12,798
is used for

516
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,839
analysis and then the criteria to

517
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,839
participate in the study was that you

518
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,278
had to be a 10year track faculty uh you

519
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,079
had to be at an R1 University that I

520
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,519
selected but I'm keeping that

521
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,839
confidential and then you have have to

522
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,679
be defined as a comper by your

523
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,678
institution uh to reduce my

524
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,880
bias and then just some facts about the

525
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:42,600
participants in the study uh there were

526
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,000
31 participants 11 women 20 men and I

527
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,678
found that to be pretty uh

528
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,839
representative of the actual population

529
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,120
out there and then I interviewed

530
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,519
assistant associate and F

531
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,839
professors um and then I will say that

532
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,079
there were eight participants that did

533
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,798
not have any care responsibilities

534
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,918
I had to cut the slide even though it

535
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,319
was very interesting and then also this

536
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,278
is a huge part of the study uh is that

537
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,240
people who were like International or

538
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,240
foreign born they said that um it was

539
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,519
much more difficult um but due to time I

540
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,519
had to cut this slide and uh child care

541
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,798
and Elder Care were the most like common

542
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,798
care

543
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,879
responsibilities so to dive into like uh

544
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,798
some of the examples from the interview

545
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,240
my first which is that uh like

546
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:37,200
upbringing uh kind of shapes cultural

547
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,839
norms so one example is this uh

548
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,840
Professor who um is in Asian culture

549
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,079
it's very common to expect that the

550
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:48,359
Mother-in-law will come for a few months

551
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:52,398
after birth uh so he didn't even think

552
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:55,719
to take any time off or um do that so he

553
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:59,119
expected his mother-in-law and

554
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,720
wife and then uh this other uh Professor

555
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:05,000
both of his parents worked when he grew

556
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,839
up and so he expected that um his wife

557
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,038
would never stay home and he him and her

558
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,038
would also share the care

559
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,359
responsibilities so I'm just going to

560
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,399
talk about a few difficulties and then

561
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,678
I'm going to talk about how they coped

562
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:22,879
with those

563
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,440
difficulties so these were the main

564
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,799
difficulties that I saw within the

565
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,200
interviews I will only talk about

566
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,599
fieldwork and dual career your couples

567
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,440
today and give examples um fieldwork I

568
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,558
think is very specific to plant breeding

569
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
um because you just are so dependent on

570
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:43,839
so many other factors there's so many

571
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,278
collaborators and also weather um is

572
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:51,798
another big one that makes it kind of uh

573
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:55,000
difficult so to give some examples on

574
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:56,798
how uh PL breing field work and

575
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,558
balancing care responsibilities is

576
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,038
challenging when I brought this up in

577
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,200
the inter interviews I got lots of

578
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,798
comments like this is a nightmare this

579
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,440
is the busiest time of the year hard

580
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,319
just part of my job um but in this

581
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,320
example she said that it was very

582
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,439
intense and her and her husband were

583
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,278
both PL readers uh so they had to be out

584
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,399
in the field and she said that she

585
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,159
didn't really start uh actual field

586
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:22,519
breeding until her kids were like three

587
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,559
or six because it was just so

588
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:28,639
challenging but as they grew up she was

589
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,639
able to spend more time in the field

590
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,119
and then moving on to discuss a little

591
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,720
bit about dual career couples uh this

592
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,678
one PI says that when he uh says oh I

593
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,960
need to take care of the kids his

594
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,038
response is fairly positive but her

595
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,319
response I mean yeah she can get

596
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:49,158
criticize sometimes even though they

597
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:51,079
both actually uh try to share their

598
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,399
responsibilities and then I also just

599
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:57,240
want to note that I had a wide range of

600
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:59,319
uh participants that had a partner as a

601
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,839
stay-at-home mom all the way to like

602
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,000
they were also a plant reader and even

603
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,959
the in the relationships where they

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,679
really did strive to be equal I still

605
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,240
noticed that the mothers were still

606
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,759
handling more of the logistics and

607
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,480
management of the children like making

608
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:19,319
sure that they are going to the dentist

609
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,839
every year or um like knowing the names

610
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,839
of their doctors or things like

611
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:29,720
that and then moving into how these Pi

612
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,359
is cop I it the biggest one was mainly

613
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,759
family that lived close

614
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:40,199
by um and so for example this uh Pi she

615
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,720
really relied heavily on her parents to

616
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,440
take care of her child for the first

617
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,919
three years and she's uh is an assistant

618
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
professor and so she said I really could

619
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,600
not have started uh without my parents

620
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,599
like they helped so

621
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:02,240
much and then the other thing that uh

622
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:05,359
was the main form of support was uh just

623
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,120
money being able to hire uh

624
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,519
Nanny and so I guess as a grad student I

625
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,599
was surprised at how many people had

626
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,679
nannies especially for like three to six

627
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,839
years so these nannies really became

628
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,480
like a second mom to the children and

629
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,519
then daycare was another huge topic um

630
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,599
but in this example she said that

631
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,759
there's zero flexibility with drop drop

632
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,319
off and pickup times so uh she would

633
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,519
have to leave leave and if she wasn't

634
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:35,158
done with work she would have to work in

635
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,159
the evening which would be pretty

636
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,200
exhausting and then so to finish up with

637
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,640
this um the main points were that care

638
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,960
responsibilities are shaped by our

639
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,038
upbringing and cultural and gender norms

640
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,840
and then fieldwork and traveling were

641
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,558
the biggest

642
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,079
challenges um I guess I kind of forgot

643
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:58,440
to mention traveling a bit but traveling

644
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:02,000
uh both men and women I noticed that

645
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,360
they had to reduce uh their amount of

646
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,640
travel and this was even uh worse in

647
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,199
dual career

648
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,679
companies and then uh community and

649
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,960
financial resources were the main uh

650
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:22,000
things that helped faculty kind of

651
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,000
overcome these difficulties and manage

652
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,200
it and uh so so much so because of

653
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:34,319
literature I did ask about policy and I

654
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,600
had that in the interview um and not one

655
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,798
faculty had anything good to say about

656
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,000
policy so I really don't think that this

657
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,000
is the way to

658
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:47,879
go um I

659
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,798
think reasonably it it would help more

660
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,278
so if we adjusted our mindset and

661
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,599
attitude about care responsibilities in

662
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:57,519
Academia I think another thing that

663
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:00,918
would be big is um like changing our

664
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:04,120
attitude to especially towards uh using

665
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,159
the policies there's a lot of um

666
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,518
negative uh attitude towards that and

667
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,399
then one thing that I wish I would have

668
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:14,120
asked more so in the interviews is uh

669
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:17,879
more so about like your work environment

670
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:20,719
I think that plays a bigger role than uh

671
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,000
if there's policies or not and and then

672
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,640
also just building

673
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,398
community and having no support network

674
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,399
seem to be the most helpful for these

675
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,398
faculty

676
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,440
and now we're going to make the prep

677
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:39,839
change

678
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:44,120
so uh yeah so I am again in voytech plow

679
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:47,199
lab and so I work on double stred breaks

680
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:51,119
in recombination with

681
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,240
maze so uh recombination is obviously

682
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:58,518
very helpful for plant breeders it will

683
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,399
allow us uh like uh breeders to stack

684
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:05,399
traes or kind of break trades apart to

685
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:05,398
create new combinations of

686
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,879
alals and then um so Rec combination

687
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,440
starts with double stred breaks and it

688
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,679
ends in Crossovers and so as we can see

689
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,278
uh the Double stranded breake uh

690
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,120
distribution is quite uh uniform but

691
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,278
then crossovers mainly happen at

692
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,479
chromosome

693
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,440
ends oh I guess you can't see it but

694
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,720
there's roughly 200 to 500 double

695
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,798
stranded braks there's so many but then

696
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,038
only 10 to 20

697
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,519
crossovers myosis and so it made me

698
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,278
wonder if we can predict these double

699
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,759
stranded brakes compared to these double

700
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:44,960
stranded

701
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:48,038
Brakes in the middle of the chromosome

702
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,120
and so my one of my questions is can

703
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:54,759
crossover competent dsps be

704
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:57,479
distinguished from crossover incompetent

705
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,240
dsps and so I am looking at genomic

706
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,919
location

707
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,079
uh CG and chg DNA methylation and DNA

708
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,600
replication

709
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:10,678
origin uh my hypothesis is that double

710
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:15,480
stranded breaks that do result in

711
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,480
crossovers um have very similar

712
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:22,480
environments and so um I think that dsps

713
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:25,959
in genic regions and low methylated

714
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,399
areas and in early replication regions

715
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,679
in S phase are more likely

716
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,278
to um result in

717
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,038
crossovers so I just wanted to say a

718
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,038
little bit about this but I won't go

719
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:41,119
into any results or anything so I just

720
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:43,240
want to say uh thank you to Holly for

721
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,798
letting me do this project and also for

722
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,200
the participants for giving me their

723
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:51,278
time to be interviewed and uh for them

724
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,080
to trust me with their stories and

725
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,880
experiences because I think that is

726
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:59,319
really hard to do and then for voidtech

727
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,320
um for my trended break

728
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,319
project

729
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,880
thanks yep I was just wondering how do

730
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,798
you feel about your like two different

731
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,278
types of research that you're doing like

732
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:17,960
if there something that you like more or

733
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,720
less about kind of moreal research

734
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,759
versus what you're doing now and what

735
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,360
motivated that

736
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:28,000
switch um uh I guess so what motivated

737
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,519
the switch is I worked in industry for a

738
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,038
little bit in retor my undergrad in grad

739
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,798
school and I just felt like I like had

740
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,119
such a horrible experience that it kind

741
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:42,480
of pissed me off when I said I'm going

742
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,638
to do this project with hly and then um

743
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,798
I guess I forget what the first part was

744
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:50,798
but just the differences yeah but is

745
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:53,798
there something that like more about

746
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,798
one

747
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:05,119
um I will say with the dsb project it is

748
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,358
really hard to analyze chipseek

749
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,559
data not with uh like transcription

750
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:13,519
factors but something that occurs all

751
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,398
across the genome that is difficult and

752
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:19,838
then also something difficult with uh

753
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:23,838
the qualitative data is that each story

754
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:27,000
is so unique that it's just so hard to

755
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:30,398
kind of make sense of it which is why I

756
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,599
find Max qda really helpful so that I

757
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,559
can kind of Mark up the transcripts uhuh

758
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,119
yeah um I also just want to comment on

759
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,440
like kind of how poetic switch was

760
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,760
talking about like going from like your

761
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,519
work to your like life and how that

762
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,679
Ballance sometimes isn't balance as it

763
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,878
kind of was ination so I really enjoy

764
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,280
the fact you included both they're both

765
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:55,358
really important to you so in The Care

766
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,679
Project is there any sort of um Contin

767
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,159
thought that you have a conversation

768
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,760
that we can start having for now to be

769
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:06,199
able to know open the the dialogue up

770
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,240
for like women who want to go faulty

771
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,159
positions and worry about having

772
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,598
children and timing and like do you have

773
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,078
any

774
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,039
thoughts yeah I have thought about uh

775
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,960
potentially having like a discussion

776
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:21,599
here or at a conference especially with

777
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,000
like the generation now and the older

778
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,240
generation to

779
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,400
hear uh some of the challenges that

780
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:29,199
they've gone

781
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,680
through um yeah because that is actually

782
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,439
something that kind of prompted this

783
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,639
like having conversations with older

784
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,280
women and just kind of seeing how sad

785
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,679
they

786
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,040
were um and then also just uh having

787
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,000
conversations with my peers I feel like

788
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:50,159
a lot of people kind of worry about

789
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,838
being able to do both take time off were

790
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:56,480
they similar or were there a lot of

791
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:59,358
variation depending on what Unity

792
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,559
par I I guess they were similar as in

793
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:05,159
that they had PR to leave but the amount

794
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,838
of time was very different like some

795
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,679
were like two weeks some were at 10

796
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,880
weeks I think um at one University it

797
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:17,598
was like two

798
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,640
months uh I oh I just want to point out

799
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,920
this afternoon The Graduate science

800
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:28,279
start having discussion about topics big

801
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,880
red from I think it's from 430

802
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:39,800
so there are these fin of discussions

803
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:39,800
going on on and yeah that's talking yeah

804
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,280
thanks as a sociologist reading program

805
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:54,239
thank you for doing this considering

806
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:57,880
your your um you mention um that when

807
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:01,199
when explaining thex that would group of

808
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,160
you do not have person how how do you

809
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:07,239
define that um so that they don't have

810
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,199
family or they have old care for or they

811
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,159
do have children what do you mean by

812
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:16,000
that and my second question is um when

813
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:19,239
you mention that for du couples there is

814
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,239
more toll takes more toll on the the

815
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,078
woman than the man what what exact

816
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:28,399
impact does this

817
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:31,079
need yeah those are a good questions

818
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,280
um so I guess

819
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,599
I'll oh yeah I'll answer the first

820
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,880
question first how did I Define someone

821
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,280
with no care responsibilities it was

822
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,358
someone that either didn't have any

823
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:48,640
children um didn't have any sort of uh

824
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:51,119
dependence and then also people that had

825
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,118
not yet uh had to take care of their

826
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,200
parents I know eventually they might

827
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,358
have to but they didn't really have any

828
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:02,399
sort of care need uh they also said that

829
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:05,239
they it wasn't really a burden like they

830
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,240
didn't have any health issues um

831
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,239
anything

832
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,960
self-related and then uh can you remind

833
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,200
me what your

834
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,039
second um you were talking

835
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:24,000
about asking the field work and the

836
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,279
traveling to tool on women than the men

837
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,838
so what exact

838
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,400
imp yeah one example that I had to cut

839
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:35,639
out was that she uh this female faculty

840
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,800
she said that her husband also was a

841
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:41,358
faculty or I mean he also was a pimp

842
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,519
reader but in industry and so he had to

843
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:45,078
drive I think he worked like 20 minutes

844
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,639
away and so she said since she was

845
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,240
closer she still had to like if uh there

846
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:53,239
was any sort of emergency she would have

847
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,838
to go pick up her

848
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,559
children

849
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,799
um or she would have to take the day off

850
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:00,519
she was always kind of the one

851
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,000
sacrificing if there was any sort of

852
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:09,400
need that the kids

853
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,400
had if that makes sense sense

854
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,358
okay this is more comment a question but

855
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:18,759
what

856
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:24,358
the side effects of and everything going

857
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,359
on is that they virtual a lot of

858
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,358
offer can't

859
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:42,199
that's something that I don't think

860
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,680
organized that I don't think realize

861
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,679
that that's

862
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,920
actually that's

863
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,919
com I don't know

864
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,839
yeah that did come up in the interviews

865
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,680
where some people were like wow I am on

866
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,679
Zoom but I still have to take care of my

867
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,559
