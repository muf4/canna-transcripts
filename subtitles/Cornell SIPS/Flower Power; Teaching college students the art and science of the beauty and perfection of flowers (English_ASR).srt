1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,759
thank you neil

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
it's a pleasure to be here it's uh

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,079
i sort of consider cornell to be you

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
know one of the pillars one of the

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,278
origins of horticulture in the united

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,039
states so it's

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,960
it's wonderful to be here

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
and this is kind of an interesting

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
anomaly i i don't give a lot of talks

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
about teaching

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
uh not that i don't like

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,799
to give talks about teaching it's just

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,479
that most of the time you know we

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,599
research scientists aren't invited to

17
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,119
talk about

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
our teaching stuff we're invited to talk

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,199
about our research stuff

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,960
and so i'm going to blaze through some

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,399
of the various things that that i'm

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
working on and

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,239
so i'm basically going to be

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,078
i'll give you a little background about

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,839
myself

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,039
neil just gave quite a bit of it already

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
but

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
i'm going to talk a little bit about my

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,960
research and my extension work

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,878
and then talk a little bit about our

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
teaching programs at uc davis that

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,520
relate to the plant sciences and

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,000
relating to what i'm presenting here

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,478
and then with that context i will dive

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,319
into talking about the the

36
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,319
the course that i've come to talk to you

37
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,000
about

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,438
so some of this you just you just

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,200
learned but the core is that uh

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,399
i have a number of different things

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,640
going on and the first half of my career

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,680
was focused pretty much on ornamentals

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,359
and now i'm focused more widely

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,079
this book on the market serverless

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,519
culture is one that michael raviv and i

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,158
put together and it's sort of the

47
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,478
definitive guide on

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
on uh

49
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,478
on in the field of hydroponics and if

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,719
you look really really carefully this

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,078
guy in the red shirt right there is that

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,759
guy right there

53
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,399
do you remember this spot

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,840
in colombia

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
yeah anyway so

56
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,279
i'm sorry i wasn't aware of that yeah

57
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,438
you're

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,800
you're you're a

59
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,159
covergirl kind of thing you know

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
anyway so

61
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,719
um

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,480
i do uh i have research and instruction

63
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,520
in as part of my

64
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,959
uh makeup for my position at uc davis

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
it's 25

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,479
for

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,560
instruction and research and i have a

68
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,959
big chunk agricultural experiment

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,759
station and then a pretty big chunk for

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,959
cooperative extension so i actually am a

71
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,878
specialist and connect with the advisors

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
in in the field

73
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,679
and

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
so over the years i've done quite a bit

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
of work with greenhouses and with

76
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,199
nurseries and

77
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,280
in the last few years i've also started

78
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,878
looking at indoor production

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,719
people used to talk to me about indoor

80
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,159
production as to whether that might be a

81
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,000
reasonable thing to do and i told them

82
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,439
that was nonsense

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,280
people would talk to me about vertical

84
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,639
production and i say that's nonsense

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,759
don't go there

86
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,158
it makes no sense and of course now i'm

87
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,120
aiming directly into that direction and

88
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,479
we'll be

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
doing a lot of things in that field

90
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,280
because actually it's

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
some interesting things have happened

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
and so i've got a couple of i'm just

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
going to

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,080
blast a few screens here of some of the

95
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,759
work that that i've been working on

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,120
we've been doing a couple of things with

97
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,280
lettuce

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,439
uh looking at various facets i've done

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,039
some work with strawberries each time i

100
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,120
work with strawberries i swear i will

101
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,919
never work with strawberries again

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,878
and

103
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,679
there's

104
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,399
too much political baggage and all this

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
stuff but anyway we've been we had this

106
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,840
project where we were looking at root

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,799
zone temperatures on strawberries

108
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,840
and uh

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,840
still looking at orchids in fact uh

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
for the early part of my career i did a

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,158
lot of work with cut flower roses

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
and i've always wanted to work on

113
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,798
orchids but i could never get any money

114
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,239
due to that work and

115
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,560
so i ended up

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
finally doing some work with orchids but

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
largely from the standpoint of trying to

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
see if we can grow

119
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,399
potted orchids hydroponically

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,120
which of course is a completely

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
oxymoronic thing because our education

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,358
to our students about orchids is don't

123
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,798
water them more than once a week because

124
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,039
you will kill them

125
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,879
and indeed if you're going to try to do

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,800
orchids hydroponically

127
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,839
you will kill a lot of orchids

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
but it is possible

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,720
and i bet you'd like me to tell you the

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
secret of that wouldn't you

131
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
i've also been working on a photovoltaic

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,160
shade house this is a nursery structure

133
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,399
in california every outdoor nursery has

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
a screen house maybe even several screen

135
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,560
house at different levels of shading

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,199
and i decided that it would make good

137
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,160
sense to do one that instead of throwing

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,360
the sunlight away

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,759
make it into electricity so this house i

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
have one section that makes takes 70

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
percent of the intercepted light makes

142
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,359
electricity

143
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,759
30 of sunlight goes through the plants

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
and another section where the

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,919
is roughly reversed i get about 35

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,400
shading and that makes electricity and

147
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,399
then the other portion the plants get

148
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,799
the sunlight and

149
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,560
so this is a my photo will take shade

150
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,478
house and if you ever want to come to

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,839
davis and visit you should probably sign

152
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,519
up to visit that

153
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,959
you would not be the only one visiting

154
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,918
that i have also become a tour guide

155
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,239
and

156
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,159
once a week at least i give a tour of

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
the shade house to whoever wants to come

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
see it

159
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,120
and

160
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
so it's a very it's a very catchy very

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
eye-catching thing and actually you're

162
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
going to see in a minute that i'm going

163
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,879
to make it even more eye-catching this

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,319
is the structure it's it's actually one

165
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,680
of the largest things i've ever built at

166
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,439
uc davis

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
it's the only thing that i've ever had

168
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,519
to do a research project where i had to

169
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,000
buy a power pole

170
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,680
it's a kind of a interesting thing but i

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
needed to connect my

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,879
photovoltaic production to the grid so

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,080
that the electricity could go somewhere

174
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,038
because i had no other use for the

175
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,439
electricity myself as you may be aware

176
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,639
in uh container nursery production you

177
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,719
really don't have a lot of use for

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,960
electricity you need a little bit to run

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
the timers and maybe some pumps for

180
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,318
irrigation but beyond that

181
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,478
we don't use it

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
so that also spurred in my mind a number

183
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,439
of ideas about the fact that well if you

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
have this kind of a thing and you have

185
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,879
the electricity right there then there

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
are some other things you can do with

187
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,279
that

188
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
so i've actually installed some screen

189
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
compartments in there with the idea of

190
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,080
actually doing some cooling in those

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
screen compartments because i have

192
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,318
electricity

193
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,720
to do that with

194
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,720
and

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,600
right now i'm also doing a lot of work

196
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
with

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,759
plant production lighting

198
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
looking at supplemental lighting in a

199
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,759
variety of ways photoperiodic lighting

200
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,000
and particularly looking at the new

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
technologies that are coming on the

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
market right now and have been coming on

203
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,960
the market i'm particularly fascinated

204
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
with led lighting because i can get

205
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,799
monochromatic lighting or sort of

206
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
monochromatic lighting

207
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,919
and suddenly we are starting to see

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,800
things that we've never seen before in

209
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,478
horticulture in terms of what we can do

210
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,400
with with that information

211
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,639
so led lighting for those of you who are

212
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,879
not familiar with the concept

213
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,079
stands for light emitting diodes

214
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,399
these are

215
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,519
now you know almost everywhere you can

216
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,159
see them

217
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,240
and the key facet to them is that the

218
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,080
prices have been coming down on them

219
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
they were initially touted as being more

220
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,318
energy efficient than light bulbs than

221
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,080
other kinds of light sources but this

222
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,879
was kind of a myth

223
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,478
but one of the big facets to led

224
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,120
lighting is that we can actually

225
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,279
construct a spectrum for that we want to

226
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
deliver to the plants so that we can

227
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,799
leave out things that the plants

228
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,879
technically don't need or we think that

229
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,639
the plants might not need so we can make

230
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,560
a lamp that makes absolutely no green

231
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,120
light we can make a lamp that makes no

232
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
infrared light and you know

233
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
so

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,599
and because we have sort of a unique

235
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,759
situation with this device in that all

236
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,878
the light comes off one side of the

237
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,199
device

238
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,520
and heat goes off both the back and the

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,038
front you can actually take the heat

240
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,959
off the back and you can channel that

241
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,959
heat away without obstructing the light

242
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,719
itself you cannot do that with

243
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,719
conventional light bulbs

244
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
and when you see people in in growth

245
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
environments where they have growth

246
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,758
rooms

247
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,360
with hid lamps generally there's a big

248
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
effort to try to get all that heat

249
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,560
channeled off

250
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,479
so it doesn't get down to your plants

251
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,478
with led lights you can hold your hand

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,800
under the led light you will not feel

253
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,599
any warmth from the lamp

254
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,359
so

255
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
that's a kind of unique feature and

256
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,120
there are actually some other unique

257
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,959
features that led lamps also have

258
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
and so this is one of the things that

259
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,479
i'm particularly focused on trying to

260
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
look at

261
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,879
initially this technology has been

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,639
focused primarily on replacing hid lamps

263
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,720
i think that's actually a mistake i

264
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,958
think the hid lamps are great they do a

265
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
great job in the greenhouse and if you

266
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,559
hang led lamps in their place

267
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,240
thinking that you've going to replace

268
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,319
the hid lamps you're going to have to do

269
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
some very special engineering to get the

270
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
money back because right now those are

271
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,680
much much more expensive

272
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,360
and the return on investment is

273
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,519
significantly lower

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,399
but if you do it a certain way and you

275
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,039
can

276
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,360
structure it so it's very plant centric

277
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,759
then you will have low lower energy

278
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
usage and

279
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,000
and you are then able to do some things

280
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
that you can't do with hid lamps such as

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
switching them on and off very fast

282
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,039
and

283
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
right now if you try to switch an hid

284
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,958
lamp on and off well you once you switch

285
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
it off you're going to wait 15 minutes

286
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,679
for it to come back fully on

287
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,159
and and in fact you'll wear out the lamp

288
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,838
really fast if you switch it on and off

289
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,919
well solid state lighting doesn't work

290
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,320
that way you can switch it on and off

291
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,399
very rapidly especially if it's designed

292
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,600
that way

293
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,879
so i've got a number of different things

294
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,240
that i'm looking at there and

295
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,600
one of the things is looking at whether

296
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,919
we can use

297
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
lighting to control various things on

298
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,519
plants in this case we are orchids and

299
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,519
we're looking at the spike length on

300
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
orchids and we really see a very

301
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,278
dramatic difference between orchids

302
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
growing under blue light and orchids

303
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,360
growing under red light with the red

304
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,440
light being much more favorable to spike

305
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,839
elongation

306
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,600
on the other hand we can i'm figuring

307
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,079
that we can use the blue light to keep

308
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,200
plants short but i haven't found a way

309
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,439
yet to do that in a reliable fashion

310
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
currently i'm building a plant growth

311
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
facility

312
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,439
which is an indoor

313
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,359
plant growing facility and you can see

314
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
we're actually building it outdoors it's

315
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,278
sitting right next to my shade house my

316
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,200
photovoltaic array

317
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,679
this is what it looks like today it's

318
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,920
actually now completed from the outside

319
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,319
and right now we're building the inside

320
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,159
and it has eight layers of production

321
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
inside it and

322
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,199
we're now no longer talking about

323
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
two-dimensional production in a

324
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
greenhouse environment but

325
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,159
three-dimensional production

326
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,078
and so it's very much a vertical

327
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,480
production situation

328
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,199
and indeed it consumes a lot of

329
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,959
electricity but i have yet to consume

330
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
all the electricity that i'm producing

331
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,239
on my pv so if anybody wants to argue

332
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,120
with me about co2 footprint i am yet

333
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000
taking co2 and making it into biomass

334
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
not the other way around

335
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:30,399
so right now this is gearing up and i

336
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:33,359
hope to have about 300 some shelf

337
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,600
space areas to work on

338
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
so anyway that's kind of my overview of

339
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
my

340
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
research and

341
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,278
that's all i'm going to say right now

342
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,799
but if you ask me about

343
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,639
some of my research projects later on

344
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,319
i'm obviously happy to talk about them

345
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,480
but my mission here today

346
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
is to talk about some teaching things

347
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
and

348
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,639
in particular i want to do that in the

349
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,278
context of how we do undergraduate and

350
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,919
graduate education at uc davis we do

351
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,399
have a plant sciences program and plant

352
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,879
sciences at uc davis is the

353
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,078
emerging of four different departments

354
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,679
we actually should have merged five

355
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,278
departments but we

356
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,399
one of them they had too much money and

357
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,480
too much

358
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,720
good stuff they didn't want to dilute

359
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
that by letting sharing that with

360
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,759
environmental horticulture and

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,519
the other three departments veg crops

362
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,879
agronomy and range science and pharmacy

363
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,200
they agreed that we should form one team

364
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,519
and in fact it was driven by teaching we

365
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,160
we realized that our weakness at uc

366
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,600
davis was our undergraduate teaching in

367
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,759
the plant sciences

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,320
and this is despite the fact that we

369
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,639
know that we are the number one plant

370
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,519
biology undergraduate teaching program

371
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,360
in the country okay so in our mind you

372
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,078
might think this can't possibly be but

373
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,800
in our mind the plant sciences part was

374
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,958
defective while the plant biology was

375
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,159
you know nationally number one

376
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,719
and we figured that in order to get our

377
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,439
plant sciences teaching up to that level

378
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
we had to make a change and that change

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
motivated us to

380
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,159
to unite into one program

381
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,320
so today we have programs that range

382
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,000
from molecular genomics genetics all the

383
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
way up to ecology

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,360
we certainly do physiology in biology

385
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,039
and in horticulture we have

386
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
uh some we certainly have a lot of

387
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,078
production horticulture but also

388
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,920
landscape and urban horticulture

389
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,958
the undergraduate majors that we have we

390
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,278
have one called environmental

391
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,439
horticulture and urban forestry this is

392
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,838
basically ornamental horticulture with a

393
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
name that nobody can find in the catalog

394
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,919
but

395
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,600
enough students keep finding it year

396
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,759
after year where it's a sustained major

397
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,920
with about 40 students in it at any one

398
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,439
point in time and we decided that we

399
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,519
would not take it apart and merge it

400
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
into something else we have started a

401
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
plant sciences undergraduate major some

402
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
of you might remember that uc davis used

403
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,278
to have a plant sciences undergraduate

404
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,759
major back in the 1980s and 1990s

405
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,198
and well we disassembled that because we

406
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,039
thought that we

407
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,399
didn't need to do that anymore

408
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,399
and then

409
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,159
but then now that we're plant sciences

410
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
department we've put that

411
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,000
teaching back on the books

412
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,759
we have related majors we have an

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
undergraduate major in plant biology we

414
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,559
have a biotechnology major that has

415
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,720
three components with plants being one

416
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,719
of those we have sustainable agriculture

417
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
as a brand new major

418
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,920
and

419
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,679
and then on the graduate program side we

420
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,958
have the horticulture and agronomy

421
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,039
graduate group

422
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,399
so that's actually where i take most of

423
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,319
my

424
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,240
graduate students we have a plant

425
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,800
biology graduate group which is actually

426
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,480
where neil got his phd

427
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,479
we also have an ecology

428
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
graduate program and a genetics graduate

429
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,240
program and those have those all have

430
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,239
phd programs as part of them

431
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,120
the

432
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,879
the plant sciences i believe is right

433
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,440
now in the 20s 30s something like that

434
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,958
growing because it started brand new it

435
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,600
didn't have any track record and now

436
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,278
it's it's accumulating students

437
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,000
the sustainable agriculture is about the

438
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,600
same size and also growing the biotech

439
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,278
is in the hundreds

440
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
and the plant side of that is actually

441
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,720
not

442
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,199
the biggest chunk of that so but there

443
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,800
are typically somewhere between 50 and

444
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:31,278
70 students in the biotech side

445
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,599
that are plan focused yeah

446
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,120
so there's there's actually quite a

447
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
diversity of what an undergraduate

448
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,759
student can get and

449
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,920
we actually specifically uh decided to

450
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,839
leave it that way because i think that

451
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,399
is the best way to meet the the needs of

452
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,399
the students

453
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,719
so my courses that i teach i teach

454
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
greenhouse and nursery production i just

455
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,278
got through teaching that winter quarter

456
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,278
our winter quarter ended last week

457
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,198
and

458
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,159
traditionally that has focused primarily

459
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,919
on

460
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,679
ornamentals because that's what in

461
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,719
california is mostly the greenhouse

462
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,638
industry

463
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,639
but i'm starting to put more in on

464
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,240
hydroponics and on vegetable production

465
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,440
because we're seeing some growth in that

466
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
area

467
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,399
i teach a graduate course on modeling

468
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,838
modeling horticultural systems and then

469
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,120
this course that i'm going to talk to

470
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,360
you about here today called flower power

471
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,360
and

472
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,759
so it's three courses and if you've kept

473
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
tabs on my teaching appointment that is

474
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,360
a success for failure if somebody with

475
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,919
25 teaching teaches this much stuff

476
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,079
and indeed it's been a pretty tough

477
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,838
road and it is a road i'm on because i

478
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,919
choose to be on this road

479
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
and so i like teaching

480
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,679
and despite the fact that i don't have

481
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,120
enough inr for it i i do it and uh

482
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,638
i would love to say my colleagues

483
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,919
tolerate it but i actually i don't think

484
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
they

485
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,000
they do so

486
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
so let's talk about the course i'm here

487
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
to talk to you about this is this is

488
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,558
actually the title the title of the

489
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
course flower power the application of

490
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,599
the art and science of the beauty and

491
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,798
perfection of flowers

492
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,119
doesn't that make you want to take the

493
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,119
course

494
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,519
i i've told people this on airplanes

495
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,198
sitting next to me and they said oh can

496
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,918
i take that course

497
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,000
do you do an online version

498
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
and uh so

499
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,558
you're you're seeing the power of

500
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,558
marketing right here right now your

501
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,519
personal feelings should have somehow

502
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,879
just sort of

503
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,639
popped up a little bit saying i got to

504
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,640
take that yeah

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
and so what i usually tell people is

506
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,120
well you have to be a student okay

507
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,639
preferably an undergraduate student we

508
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,000
don't well

509
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
anyway so

510
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,558
i want to talk to you about how this

511
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:51,599
course came about because this was not

512
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,519
dictated by any major by anybody nobody

513
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,119
said we need this course taught could

514
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,400
you teach it

515
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,399
this course i invented this course and i

516
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
invented it

517
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
on the path that i'm going to show you

518
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,119
here

519
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,200
so in 2007 i was doing a project for the

520
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,918
usda foreign act service

521
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,200
and this was a project to do a week-long

522
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,280
workshop of on flower production in

523
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
montenegro

524
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,200
so

525
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,480
the question

526
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
first question i have to ask you do you

527
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,480
know where montenegro is do you even

528
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,160
know is that a country or a city or

529
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,599
unfortunately some people think it's a

530
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,440
continent but no

531
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,359
montenegro is a little country

532
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
in the balkans right here where this

533
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,240
arrow is pointing

534
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,480
and

535
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,558
so as such it is a place where

536
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
you know americans don't go for the most

537
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,879
part

538
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,799
and europeans go there on vacation

539
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,559
somewhat it is not a particularly

540
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,038
thriving place

541
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,839
and you know what happened there say 20

542
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,839
years ago

543
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
yeah

544
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
big war

545
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,240
people butchered each other and killed

546
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,918
each other and shot each other up and

547
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,480
people moved around

548
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,799
the former yugoslavia was disintegrating

549
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,000
had disintegrated the serbians were

550
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,000
unhappy with the kosovons and

551
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,839
the montenegrins were stuck in between

552
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,119
because they're right between the two

553
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,399
sort of

554
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,439
and so this is a place of war and

555
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,160
when i started looking at this in 2007

556
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,679
i was i found myself being asked to go

557
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,519
there and when i asked well why is the

558
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,600
usda doing this

559
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,119
i said well we're collaborating with the

560
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,599
department of state because we need to

561
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,119
try to get that place to be peaceful

562
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,599
and in order to get the place to be

563
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,879
peaceful we need to boost their capacity

564
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,119
in all areas of agriculture all areas of

565
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
science whatever we can do the more we

566
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,239
can boost it the more these people

567
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
understand that it's better to not be at

568
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,079
war than

569
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,759
to

570
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,000
kill each other over what little they do

571
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,000
have

572
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
so

573
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,519
as i was leaving

574
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,360
to fly over there

575
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,279
my wife gave me a book

576
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,359
and this is the book she gave me and she

577
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,839
said i ought to read this book

578
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,359
and i was thinking yeah yeah yeah honey

579
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,079
i don't read books i don't have time for

580
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,839
that

581
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,918
but on the plane you know with nothing

582
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,199
better to do okay sometimes i actually

583
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
read a book

584
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,279
and so as i opened the book on the plane

585
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,880
i had a bit of a revelation

586
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,158
and

587
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,080
in particular i knew the main characters

588
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,000
so this is actually the very first bit

589
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,439
of text in the book you know

590
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,679
introduction what's the first thing a

591
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,360
person does when you hand them flowers

592
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,519
bob let's go general manager of the san

593
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,599
francisco flower market asked me

594
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,038
i'm thinking i know bob

595
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,480
okay

596
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,960
and this is bob okay

597
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,079
so and it's me standing with bob on one

598
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,679
of our student field trips actually and

599
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,399
so i'm looking at this thing and said

600
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,919
whoa yeah i'm reading a book you know

601
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,679
published book new york times

602
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,038
best-selling book

603
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,519
and i know the character on the page one

604
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,279
okay and as i keep reading through it i

605
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,798
find more and more characters you know

606
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,240
that i know

607
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,839
and you can go through i'm not going to

608
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,839
read all this for you but in my class

609
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,000
this is actually how i open up

610
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,240
the class i tell them exactly what i've

611
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,038
just told you how the class came about

612
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,279
and i actually read them this out loud

613
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,038
hopefully then when they go off and have

614
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,279
to do their reading they will already

615
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,119
sort of be sucked into this

616
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,879
world and will

617
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,199
will read it

618
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,280
so the book is by amy stewart it's an

619
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
expose on the flower industry

620
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,480
and

621
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,240
you know fundamentally between those of

622
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,400
us those of us who do floor culture

623
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,319
we've been to all the places she visited

624
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,159
as part of her research we've seen it

625
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,879
all we've seen the colombians the

626
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,720
ecuadorians the dutch the asians all

627
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,280
these things she talks about

628
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,319
and so for me it's like oh this would be

629
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,639
a great freshman seminar kind of course

630
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,720
where i could you know essentially i can

631
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,640
use this book as the course outline i

632
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,159
don't have to do any work to design the

633
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,919
thing you know and basically at each

634
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,440
chapter that they go through one chapter

635
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,559
per week i would just show them my

636
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,159
slides

637
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,240
from visiting those places and the

638
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,760
people and you know this would be great

639
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
students would love that you know so

640
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,158
anyway so i figured it'd be a really

641
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,759
easy course to put together and um so on

642
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,799
the flight back from montenegro i

643
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,798
sketched out the entire thing and when

644
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,558
when i got back to davis i proposed it

645
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,119
as a freshman seminar the administration

646
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,359
liked it and we offered it

647
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,519
and the freshman seminar style course at

648
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,199
uc davis is a 15 max enrollment course

649
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,679
to me that's kind of like oh man do i

650
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,000
want to do that much work for 15

651
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
students

652
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
well

653
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,279
i said okay i'll try it whatever anyway

654
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,880
particularly because i figured i didn't

655
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,200
have to do any work really i just get up

656
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,799
there pull out my slide sets and you

657
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,240
know step through them and whatever

658
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,079
anyway so

659
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
anyway so i arrive at the first day of

660
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,359
class

661
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,759
and there are 40 students

662
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,759
now this is impossible because this is a

663
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,400
conference room type room which is not

664
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,200
in

665
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,519
the catalog okay so you actually had to

666
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,720
have registered for this to know where

667
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,319
the room was

668
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,159
okay

669
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,399
and only 15 people

670
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,720
were actually registered

671
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,000
but 40 were sitting in the room

672
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,839
and i said well what the heck are

673
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,279
all of you doing here 25 of you are in

674
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,399
the wrong room

675
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,918
and i said no no no no no i'm i'm on the

676
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,519
waiting list i said i don't have a

677
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
waiting list oh yeah there's a waiting

678
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,519
list and indeed there were 10 people on

679
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440
the waiting list so these 10 people on

680
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,240
the waiting list were waiting for

681
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,038
people to not take the class okay people

682
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
to drop so they could slide it

683
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,558
and the rest were waiting to get on the

684
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,558
waiting list

685
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,278
this was a sign of things to come

686
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,679
because

687
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,519
i i can tell you this course has done

688
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
some really weird things that i've never

689
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,639
seen any other course do

690
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,600
so

691
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,840
the first thing i did after i thought as

692
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,119
a freshman seminar decided well this

693
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,399
doesn't this has nothing to do with

694
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,319
freshmen this doesn't need to be for

695
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
freshmen only this good you know anybody

696
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,319
should be able to take this anybody

697
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
that's has an interest in flowers

698
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,960
and so i turn it into a special topics

699
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,278
course

700
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,519
and it quickly filled whatever room i

701
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,159
picked so i had first time i had a room

702
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,319
that took like 50 seats and 50 students

703
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,240
showed up next time i took a classroom

704
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,200
had 128 seats

705
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,120
128 students showed up so it filled the

706
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,240
capacity of every room i tried

707
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,000
and

708
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,919
it's basically a course that's

709
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,278
specifically designed to give students

710
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,038
what they want

711
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,640
and on account of that it has

712
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,759
word of mouth

713
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,520
appeal

714
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,679
in addition to having this

715
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,079
flower appeal okay

716
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,759
and the key that i was trying to do with

717
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,678
this course is construct a course in

718
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,919
such a way that it would give students

719
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,440
the things they need at the time when

720
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,679
they're registering because that's when

721
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,120
they're signing up for courses and one

722
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,798
thing that a lot of students need they

723
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,359
need a small few units to fill out a

724
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,400
schedule okay and they don't want this

725
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,199
filler

726
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,919
to be some heavy-duty

727
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,000
organic chemistry course okay in fact

728
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,240
they want the exact opposite of an

729
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
organic chemistry course okay

730
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,480
which by the way in case you didn't

731
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,400
notice this is probably why horticulture

732
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,000
students come to horticulture because

733
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,679
they figure they can get away from some

734
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,679
of these other courses that are a little

735
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,080
difficult

736
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,480
they want an interesting material no

737
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,798
stress they want to be useful

738
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,038
and as such they prefer to have passed

739
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,720
no pass grading

740
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,319
i also learned that many of them would

741
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,480
have liked to have this course be

742
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,158
general ed but general light is a lot of

743
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,278
work okay that means i got to great

744
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,120
papers and do writing and i said yeah

745
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,558
let's try it without that see if we get

746
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,359
enough people

747
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,158
and

748
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,558
and they want it as a compact place in

749
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,640
the schedule late afternoon this is this

750
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,319
is now a filler for their schedule it

751
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
needs to come at a time not in the

752
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,599
mornings when all these other courses

753
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
are conflicting with each other but late

754
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,480
in the afternoon so i built this exactly

755
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,278
to that specification

756
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,960
and that's what the course is today

757
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,400
and i have absolutely no problem with

758
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,440
this being a filler because to me

759
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,200
as long as they're paying their

760
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,278
registration and the money somehow

761
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,120
trickles down to where it needs to go i

762
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:29,919
get paid either way whether the student

763
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,239
is

764
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,919
in my major or not or whether it's a

765
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,759
heavy-duty science course or not it

766
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,640
makes no difference from the standpoint

767
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,679
of

768
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,360
of

769
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,480
and and you know it's up to the student

770
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,558
if they don't want to take it they don't

771
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,798
have to take it there's no this is not

772
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,918
required in any major

773
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,278
it is a

774
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
accessible

775
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,558
to any major and actually it has science

776
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,000
content so in many majors it counts for

777
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,519
the science

778
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,679
in that major

779
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,679
so

780
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,079
so it's now a regular uc davis course

781
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,399
it's called plant science six that is

782
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,480
our designated number it is designed as

783
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,798
a survey of floor culture two units past

784
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,400
no pass it runs ten weeks one late

785
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,158
afternoon meeting per week usually

786
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,320
tuesday afternoons in the most

787
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,240
comfortable lecture hall i can find

788
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,439
has to have nice padded seats has to be

789
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,519
comfortable it has to be the kind of

790
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,200
thing where on tuesday afternoon at 4

791
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,359
o'clock when they come in they sit down

792
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,960
and they let

793
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,158
i'm here

794
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
so

795
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
with that

796
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,240
this is a destination it's a destination

797
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,200
during the week and i can tell you the

798
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,960
students come

799
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,798
so i also do

800
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,399
just a little bit of testing with the

801
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,038
multiple choice questions they're not

802
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,239
difficult exams there are and because

803
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:50,240
it's passed no pass they are

804
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,599
well they they can usually pass without

805
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,640
doing a lot

806
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:59,759
so spring 2013 enrollment was 170.

807
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
and then that classroom became too full

808
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,398
i decided well let's go for a bigger

809
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,880
room i found another lecture all had 370

810
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,239
369 seats and last year i had 300

811
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,039
students

812
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,839
currently enrollment is at 360.

813
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,839
nine more probably by now and it will

814
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,319
have a waiting list and this waiting

815
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,398
list will probably be

816
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,359
40 students long

817
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:26,719
in the course of spring first few days

818
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,558
of spring quarter i will lose probably

819
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,360
50 of these students

820
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,359
okay because it's by design it's a

821
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,519
filler in their schedule they have

822
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,439
something there a lot of students park

823
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,519
something there because they can't find

824
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,080
something else okay so this is parked

825
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,759
there now some students end up with it

826
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,678
there particularly after the first day

827
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,200
of lecture

828
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,559
but a lot of students drop it because

829
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,558
they need something else they have you

830
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,639
know they've got to do their major stuff

831
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,398
but if i have a fairly long waiting list

832
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,559
it'll all still shuffle in and then i

833
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,439
end up with a class that's nearly full

834
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:01,678
i'm expecting 2015 my enrollment to be

835
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,720
about 350

836
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,519
at the end it's probably what it's going

837
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,519
to settle down for

838
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,200
so

839
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,000
clearly undergraduate students are

840
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,720
interested in floor culture and this was

841
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,119
actually a bit of a revelation because

842
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
up until this point everybody that i

843
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,319
ever talked to about floriculture is oh

844
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,240
this is a minor niche thing students

845
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,720
aren't interested in this students don't

846
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,159
care about this field and

847
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,159
anyway we were wrong

848
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
so i'll tell you some of the various

849
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,599
facets that are

850
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,159
embedded into this course it's you know

851
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,480
i talk about how flowers are produced

852
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,919
how the florist gets them the whole

853
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,440
wholesale side of the picture

854
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,840
i teach them some common names of

855
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,200
flowers the whole idea being is that if

856
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,879
they're going to go into flower shop and

857
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,519
buy flowers they got to know what

858
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,600
they're buying okay it's like if they're

859
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,918
going to go buy a cd they need to know

860
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,158
the bands okay and they need to know

861
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,480
them by their used names

862
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,960
not by their latin names so i give them

863
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,480
latin names also sometimes but i'm

864
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
primarily interested in learning the

865
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,679
common names

866
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,519
and then how to handle them you know we

867
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,440
know a lot about post post service

868
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,359
handling and

869
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,519
a lot of that i you know they get a

870
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,278
lecture on how to do the post service

871
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,278
handling

872
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,519
they get some facets of the science

873
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,398
about genetically modified organisms

874
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,000
about botany plant biology horticulture

875
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,479
and flora culture but that's kind of a

876
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,398
toned down part it's woven enough into

877
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,679
it to hopefully generate some interest

878
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,918
among them so some of them might

879
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,278
actually take our other plant science

880
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,278
courses

881
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,839
then of course the reading is the and

882
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,319
discussion is centered around uh the

883
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,278
book flower confidential

884
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,960
and

885
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,519
so indeed i do exactly as what i

886
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,720
initially planned i do a lot of various

887
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,038
things that you know seem

888
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,640
fluffy you know

889
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,879
trust me it's fluffy

890
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,120
fluffy by design you know it's like a

891
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,039
great doughnut you know i was like don't

892
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,278
tell me you don't like great doughnuts

893
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,038
you know it's like it's fluff

894
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,599
we have art in there i mean art after

895
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,359
all is in the title okay all i forgot to

896
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,359
tell you is when i tried to get that

897
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,519
title through the courses committee they

898
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,918
said no no you can't have that title

899
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,599
that title is too long

900
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,919
here's what here's the title of this

901
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,918
book this is flowers and their uses

902
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,679
uh

903
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
okay

904
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
thank god for word of mouth you know

905
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
that i don't have to count on somebody

906
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,558
actually looking in the catalog

907
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,558
to be marketed my course to okay

908
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,278
anyway so

909
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:44,158
i use this title i always use this title

910
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,759
and anyway it has art in the title

911
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,559
and so the students do an art project

912
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,079
and in fact they uh

913
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,319
these are some of the examples we have

914
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:55,439
them do a little panel

915
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,038
for with a with a letter of their choice

916
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,038
initially they had to use the first

917
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,200
letter of their last name

918
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,640
and but they then have to find a flower

919
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,319
look it up find out what it actually

920
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,759
looks like and give me some art some

921
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,720
original art

922
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,798
and they have to do it in this

923
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,798
particular format because i have other

924
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,879
uses for this particular art because as

925
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,798
you see i have letters i can spell

926
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,480
interesting things with what they give

927
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,200
me

928
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
so this is one of the projects and

929
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,278
there's always a few people who just

930
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,480
can't be bothered to do it they're you

931
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:29,440
know they did that in second grade and

932
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,558
that seems like second great stuff but

933
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
okay we do a flower arranging workshop

934
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,398
actually

935
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,398
last year we did nine separate workshops

936
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,918
during one particular week instead of

937
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,158
that week's lecture

938
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,320
so we did actually me and my staff we

939
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,760
did as much work

940
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:50,398
that entire week that week as the entire

941
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,000
rest of the quarter combined

942
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,759
so i'd love to say i'm never doing that

943
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,359
again but i'm going to do it one more

944
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,720
time this year and i'll you'll see in a

945
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,678
few minutes why

946
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,519
students actually love it okay and i'm

947
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,720
not and you might think ah come on

948
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,798
there's a whole bunch of guys who aren't

949
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,960
going to get into this

950
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:11,839
not not so okay everybody gets into it

951
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
and

952
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,918
actually quite interesting

953
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,038
this particular person right here

954
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,880
you might not be able to tell but this

955
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,558
person is blind

956
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,200
how do you deal with a student with that

957
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,440
kind of disability in a course like this

958
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,120
well guess what it's about flowers

959
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
and these flowers to a blind person are

960
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,798
just as potent as to a seeing person

961
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,959
it's just they

962
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,278
sense something different okay

963
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,640
so her bouquet was going to be

964
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,599
she wasn't going to put stuff in and it

965
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,278
doesn't have scent all right she's gonna

966
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,798
anyway so

967
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,240
i learned a bunch of things from this

968
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,798
student i was really happy this student

969
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,480
came on board because i had no clue how

970
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,798
i would teach this material to a blind

971
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,480
person so it was actually

972
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,679
i may have learned more from

973
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,960
watching her

974
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,600
learn the material than than

975
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,000
than i would have thought

976
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,158
then in one lecture i give every student

977
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,640
a flowering pot of plant this happens

978
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,119
about the third week of the quarter

979
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,079
and the student is giving given this

980
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,240
plant

981
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,200
and with the instruction that they have

982
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,759
to make some impact with it

983
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,519
and the first question that

984
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,839
usually comes back is can i make impact

985
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,440
on myself and

986
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,039
what i usually say to this well you're

987
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,039
going to have a writing assignment where

988
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,398
you have to describe what impact you

989
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,719
made with it

990
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,319
and if you want to write about how it

991
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,559
made an impact on you

992
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,679
that's fine but i would caution you that

993
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,918
that might be a little bit more

994
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,039
difficult than giving it to your mother

995
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,199
and your mother

996
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,440
being just exuberant about it or

997
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,279
something like that so anyway they have

998
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,358
to do a writing assignment it's an essay

999
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
it's not a particularly long

1000
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,559
thing but

1001
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,440
there have been some very memorable

1002
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,440
essays particularly i still recall one

1003
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,039
young asian student who took a white

1004
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,039
chrysanthemum to her mother and nearly

1005
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,639
got thrown out of the family for doing

1006
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,400
so

1007
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,239
if you don't know why

1008
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,480
then you don't know

1009
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,759
then you need to come take the course

1010
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,159
because you see

1011
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,320
in asian culture you need to understand

1012
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,319
what a white chrysanthemum represents

1013
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,559
and it has a much more strong

1014
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,320
representation in asian culture than

1015
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,719
these meanings of flowers have in our

1016
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,400
culture and this young lady should have

1017
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,959
known better but somehow in her

1018
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,599
upbringing that wasn't imprinted on her

1019
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,800
but her mother who was chinese was very

1020
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,240
much imprinted and had been ill and now

1021
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,760
getting this white flower which was

1022
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,358
supposed to pepper up

1023
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,680
well in that culture the white

1024
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,358
chrysanthemum is a funeral flower okay

1025
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,358
so

1026
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,960
not good but these are the kinds of

1027
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,960
essays i'm getting you know at least

1028
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,880
some percentage are

1029
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,320
like that

1030
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,240
so we discuss some very difficult

1031
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,320
dilemmas when a friend has a birthday

1032
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,519
are flowers worth more than balloons or

1033
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,960
chocolates

1034
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,000
is it okay to bribe somebody with

1035
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
flowers

1036
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,639
now you might want to think about this

1037
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,640
yourself

1038
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:08,078
think about it do you think it's okay

1039
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:11,279
if you want something good to happen

1040
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,280
to give somebody flowers

1041
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,800
is it okay to do that but it's not okay

1042
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,800
to give them money

1043
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,320
it's not okay to give them a bottle of

1044
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,279
wine or something the flowers you can

1045
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,079
get away with things that you can't get

1046
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,599
with

1047
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,599
any other thing

1048
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,800
it's a power tool of extraordinary

1049
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,480
proportions

1050
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,800
it indeed

1051
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,760
this is why the course is called flower

1052
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,880
power because flowers in fact have a

1053
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,880
power that nothing else around us has

1054
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,240
and so

1055
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,480
students learn this and

1056
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,919
and then of course i try to get in and

1057
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,159
get them to think a little bit more than

1058
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,480
just the flower itself but looking at

1059
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:58,078
you know colors and patterns and depth

1060
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,000
and and you know pot mums versus orchids

1061
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,160
and things like that so trying to give

1062
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,719
them a sense of value with respect to

1063
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,719
the flowers

1064
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
and

1065
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,960
i was actually making a presentation

1066
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,880
about this course to

1067
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,400
some uh to the board of the american

1068
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
floral endowment

1069
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,920
and i was explaining to them

1070
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,400
one thing that these students had told

1071
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,358
me and and one thing that i learned from

1072
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,079
them is that they would buy flowers

1073
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,639
if they had a way to buy them but in

1074
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,119
davis the campus is like its own little

1075
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,799
city there are no flower shops on campus

1076
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,800
if a student wants to get flowers

1077
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,039
they've got to go to one of the grocery

1078
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,359
stores or to one of the big box stores

1079
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,199
and there they can get them but to do

1080
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,039
that they got to take a bus

1081
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,358
to get there or they're going on their

1082
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,719
bicycles

1083
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,639
are they going to be lugging flowers on

1084
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,159
their bicycles

1085
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,319
you see what kind of extraordinary

1086
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,440
length a student needs to go through to

1087
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,800
do this

1088
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,240
whereas for

1089
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,240
you know if like if you're going to your

1090
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:01,039
friends those are you not students if

1091
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,358
you know if you're a working

1092
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,559
adult and you're going to visit some

1093
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,239
friends you you know you'd have no

1094
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,639
trouble finding flowers you pick them up

1095
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,879
on the way there right well

1096
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,118
in the hands of the in for these

1097
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,280
students they have a difficult time with

1098
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,480
this because they don't have good access

1099
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,280
and on top of that it's not being

1100
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,440
marketed to them at all largely because

1101
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,119
the floriculture industry is doesn't see

1102
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,200
that they're there they don't see them

1103
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,519
as a force in the marketplace so they

1104
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,159
don't see it as something that should be

1105
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,280
cultured and built up

1106
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,960
so

1107
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,560
basically what i learned is that the

1108
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
floriculture industry is simply not

1109
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,639
doing a particularly good job to get

1110
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,960
flowers into the hands of students

1111
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,920
and everyone that i've talked to on the

1112
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,760
industry side would tell me

1113
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,800
they're not going to buy flowers they're

1114
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,359
not buyers of flowers

1115
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,280
so anyway one thing that i figured is i

1116
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,319
have this very large group 300 some

1117
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
students

1118
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,838
i can do some surveys

1119
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,759
and so now

1120
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,920
and they're from all cross-sections of

1121
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,920
society now okay maybe not all

1122
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,320
cross-sectional societies these are

1123
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,599
students or college in college

1124
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,359
you know probably going into a

1125
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,838
particular array into particular

1126
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,960
lives where they will have maybe

1127
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,279
an above average income

1128
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,240
is this a clientele you want to develop

1129
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,040
or not in floriculture remember flowers

1130
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,799
are

1131
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,599
luxury objects

1132
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,839
so

1133
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,160
anyway the floral endowment was very

1134
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,799
interested in seeing data on this so

1135
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,719
they've actually funded a project for me

1136
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,640
to ask these students and they get the

1137
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,199
money into my hands

1138
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,759
literally the day before spring quarter

1139
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,480
started last quarter so last quarter i

1140
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,320
wove a bunch of surveys already in

1141
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,079
to it and then this spring quarter

1142
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,359
starting basically

1143
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,760
in two weeks

1144
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,319
i'm going to do the project sort of full

1145
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,720
blast and and hit the students with

1146
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,480
targeted questions

1147
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,000
because i can ask him about consumer

1148
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,599
preferences

1149
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,760
and

1150
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,800
hopefully we can learn how the flower

1151
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,400
industry can unlock this market

1152
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
so for the surveys

1153
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,599
i have actually a very interesting tool

1154
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,920
already when i take attendance the

1155
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,760
students have to come with a scantron

1156
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,358
form i don't know if you have scantron

1157
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,599
machines here at cornell for us uc davis

1158
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,358
maintains a set of scantron machines

1159
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,480
which are machines that you can

1160
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,159
grade

1161
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,559
multiple choice

1162
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,199
testing with okay the students have to

1163
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,519
have a scantron form to run through the

1164
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,279
scantron machine and they cost like a

1165
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,280
quarter each or a dime or something like

1166
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,119
that they're very cheap

1167
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,880
but because i do use those for

1168
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,559
attendance already

1169
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,240
the student is already using them and i

1170
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,039
have a hundred slots where i could ask

1171
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,719
questions on them so as long as i can

1172
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,880
form my question in the form of a

1173
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,919
multiple choice or true false question i

1174
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,760
can ask any question i want

1175
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,240
now you might think

1176
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,240
that that's not true i mean

1177
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,919
think about some questions that in a

1178
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,919
typical server you cannot ask

1179
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,239
are you gay

1180
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,240
are you rich

1181
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,838
are you poor

1182
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,399
how would you ask a question like that

1183
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,480
in a conventional survey

1184
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,519
i can ask these questions

1185
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,519
okay i just have to phrase them cleverly

1186
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,079
and i have to give the students

1187
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,599
the choice to opt out so they don't

1188
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,000
fill out the question

1189
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,920
and indeed all these questions that are

1190
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,318
not point generating questions the

1191
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,000
students know which questions generate

1192
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,400
points and which ones don't

1193
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,920
but when i make the survey at the very

1194
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,039
beginning of the quarter i have already

1195
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,159
told them

1196
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,480
that this is

1197
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,960
nationally funded research they are part

1198
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,760
of a nationally funded project

1199
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,400
to help college students

1200
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,560
have better access to flowers

1201
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,240
so they have another motivation to

1202
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,440
answer the questions

1203
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,679
and they know that i'm not going to

1204
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,119
be saying much about it but

1205
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,118
each of the

1206
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,599
forms has their student id number on

1207
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,960
them so week after week i can link all

1208
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,519
the surveys

1209
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,880
so i have the most incredible database

1210
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,960
of information

1211
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,519
and i only have to ask the gender

1212
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,039
question once i only have to ask the age

1213
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,079
question once

1214
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,000
because

1215
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,400
my database i just keep adding more

1216
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,719
tables in and i can link across these

1217
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,720
tables

1218
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,519
and because otherwise if they don't turn

1219
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,519
the form in they don't get their

1220
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,838
attendance points

1221
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,838
they're pretty much captive they pretty

1222
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,159
much have to turn the piece of paper in

1223
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:41,838
how they mark is a different story but

1224
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,399
if you've ever done any surveys that's

1225
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,318
half the battle is getting the form back

1226
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,838
half the battle is having them actually

1227
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,119
look at the thing

1228
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,039
make a decision but in this case we got

1229
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,000
the vast majority of people answering

1230
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,000
the questions and

1231
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:03,358
so we had uh some consumer preference

1232
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,639
testing on pot roses on

1233
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,960
orchids

1234
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,400
this was actually an example of how

1235
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,400
the survey was being run this is

1236
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
actually in the classroom we had two

1237
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,960
more stations like this in other

1238
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,919
adjacent buildings because with 300 some

1239
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,838
students

1240
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,480
to do have them walk around a table like

1241
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,239
this that can take a half an hour so we

1242
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,519
sent them out to lots of different

1243
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,039
places in

1244
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,679
and then on this particular day when

1245
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,000
they do this

1246
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,679
they also get the pot of plant

1247
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,519
okay and the pot of plants

1248
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,639
end up in their hands to make flower

1249
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,000
impact with

1250
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,920
so we get the

1251
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,920
in this case we got

1252
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,680
two-thirds of these flowers donated a

1253
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,800
third we grew ourselves in fact i grew

1254
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:44,639
them in my

1255
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,359
greenhouse production class

1256
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,118
and and so and then the students had to

1257
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,679
actually pony up some cash they had to

1258
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,880
make a donation if they were going to

1259
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,399
get a

1260
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,240
pot rose they had to make a two dollar

1261
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,318
donation if they had an orchid they had

1262
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,279
to get a five dollar donation

1263
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,800
if they weren't willing to make a

1264
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,519
donation they could take one of the free

1265
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,720
mums that i had grown

1266
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,000
which are

1267
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,799
pretty nice looking plants also

1268
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,719
so

1269
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,880
and then in the flower ranging

1270
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,279
we do some consumer preference there

1271
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,680
also we had the vases donated by

1272
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,519
somebody and then we said well we can do

1273
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,159
a preference testing on that to see what

1274
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:25,119
students prefer there and so we have you

1275
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,799
know 18 different vases students can

1276
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,200
show preference we have different

1277
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,519
flowers that flower growers donate it to

1278
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,519
this cost which of course first we do

1279
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,519
the survey then the students can grab

1280
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,159
flowers and make

1281
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,159
arrangements

1282
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,880
we also tried

1283
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,039
to analyze the individual bouquets to

1284
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,039
see if we could characterize bouquets we

1285
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,639
haven't quite finished with doing that

1286
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,759
and i'm not sure that this is really

1287
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,039
going to work

1288
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,160
as yet but basically each student has a

1289
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,519
a number

1290
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,598
in a particular

1291
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,838
workshop you can actually see the part

1292
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,960
of lindsay's name there and you can see

1293
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,039
some other names there i should have

1294
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,639
blotted those out i suppose but the

1295
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,838
different bouquets are made by the

1296
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,759
different participants they're

1297
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,358
photographed and then

1298
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,119
set out and then the students go with

1299
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,799
their scantron form and do

1300
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,079
give us their preferences

1301
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,680
and you might think that that would be

1302
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,240
an obvious thing but you know students

1303
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,000
have special kinds of needs when they're

1304
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,399
in a dorm room in a dorm room there

1305
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,239
isn't a lot of room okay so a big

1306
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,079
bouquet is not necessarily the most

1307
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,919
preferred thing you're looking for some

1308
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,440
very special features that will make it

1309
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,800
work okay

1310
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,200
and so this is the kind of thing we're

1311
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,079
trying to tease out out here to try to

1312
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,759
get

1313
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,880
student preferences and the company that

1314
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
donated

1315
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,599
the

1316
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,919
the

1317
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,240
the plans for this is generally very

1318
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,920
happy with the outcome because they've

1319
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,039
they've they've kind of seen what they

1320
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,559
need to do

1321
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,759
here's a few survey results i'm not

1322
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,599
going to

1323
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,839
tell you the whole story here just give

1324
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,760
you maybe two results

1325
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,358
this is a the population you can see

1326
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,000
this actually represents then the

1327
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,679
population of my plant science six class

1328
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,519
so yes indeed more

1329
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,399
more women than men

1330
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,440
but

1331
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,480
okay 17 men

1332
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,559
and then in age we have a fairly young

1333
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,838
demographic

1334
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,358
this is something that we're going to

1335
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,119
slice and dice a little different next

1336
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,598
year i didn't realize i had

1337
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,280
so many in that 18 to 20 category i

1338
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,240
thought there were

1339
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,599
going to be fewer in that but

1340
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:28,479
and then in terms of school year i have

1341
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,318
as many

1342
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,719
basically the same amount of any any

1343
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,559
class out there so it's it's wildly

1344
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,679
appealing at all levels

1345
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,880
and

1346
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,559
um

1347
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,519
in terms of consumer preference this is

1348
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,880
one example this this particular orchid

1349
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,559
you know the students are given the

1350
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,440
question

1351
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,279
you know

1352
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,800
in terms of the five responses they can

1353
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,720
make this plan is awesome very

1354
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
attractive this plan is good i like it i

1355
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,480
found it more attractive than average et

1356
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,559
cetera et cetera the last one this plant

1357
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,719
is not attractive and you can see this

1358
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,880
particular

1359
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,239
situation here if i look at a different

1360
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,838
variety

1361
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,598
that's this you can see the pattern is

1362
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,519
quite different so this particular

1363
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,119
demographic has a very

1364
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,480
particular

1365
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,599
thing they like better

1366
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,039
okay

1367
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,920
why that is i don't know it doesn't

1368
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,358
matter

1369
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,519
but to the company that has these

1370
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,960
orchids going out

1371
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,280
that can make a big difference what they

1372
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,280
send to davis

1373
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,598
here's a one question that we asked

1374
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,440
regarding access to flowers please mark

1375
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,640
all that you consider to be correct

1376
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,400
statements

1377
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,239
students generally do not buy flowers

1378
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,240
it's something this group would not do

1379
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,919
even if they had better access to floral

1380
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:46,399
products 18 percent agreed with that

1381
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,800
students do buy flowers but not many due

1382
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,079
to various reasons including access and

1383
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,680
perceived cost 81 answered that you'll

1384
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,920
notice this doesn't add to 100 because

1385
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,960
they could actually choose multiple of

1386
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,400
these as things they agreed with

1387
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,720
students would buy significantly more

1388
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,880
floor pods if they experience marketing

1389
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,279
similar to what they see for candy music

1390
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,358
clothes cosmetics toys etc

1391
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,519
40 percent

1392
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,598
i think for the industry this is very

1393
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,039
potent information

1394
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,960
they're not doing it right now anybody

1395
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,800
says they're doing it is simply not

1396
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,559
understanding that they're not doing it

1397
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,760
they're not targeting this demographic

1398
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,680
at all

1399
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,559
and they could and they could sell many

1400
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,799
more flowers into this demographic

1401
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,559
and then none of the above are correct

1402
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,318
statements about students and you see

1403
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,920
very few people would

1404
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,318
not pick one of those as being something

1405
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,760
they will mark

1406
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,239
here's another one if we open a flower

1407
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,760
shop on campus run by students which of

1408
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,279
the following would be

1409
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,359
most likely to be profitable now i

1410
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,200
should sell this information

1411
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,838
clearly i should sell this information

1412
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,759
i'm giving it away in typical university

1413
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,880
professor style

1414
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,240
so

1415
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,318
anyway if you want to start a flower

1416
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,558
shop at cornell here's your business

1417
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:58,558
model

1418
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,079
so oh and notice the last one

1419
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,960
none of the above selling floor products

1420
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,559
to students would not be profitable

1421
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,838
these are the people who would actually

1422
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,720
buy it

1423
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:14,799
and

1424
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,879
of course by the time this question was

1425
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,359
asked they had learned how to make

1426
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,838
impact with their flower so this may

1427
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,078
have been biased by

1428
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,358
you know the course itself for for these

1429
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,400
so one of the things that i have to do

1430
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,679
differently

1431
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,119
next year i have to give a pre-survey

1432
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,879
very early on

1433
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,960
and then have them come back and do this

1434
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,280
again at the end to see how their minds

1435
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,280
change

1436
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,880
so we now have lots of information like

1437
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,400
this and we're going to collect more of

1438
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,039
it

1439
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,240
so let me just summarize then for

1440
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,358
uh

1441
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,239
with respect to this flower power course

1442
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,318
the

1443
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,399
really floor culture information has

1444
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,759
very broad appeal amongst college

1445
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,800
students

1446
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,640
and

1447
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,440
it's generally much more than we would

1448
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,679
think

1449
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,200
and it's been it's been a big surprise

1450
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,279
to me

1451
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:09,039
in fact i keep teasing them that

1452
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,480
the campus uc davis is currently

1453
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:14,400
building a 600 seat classroom and i

1454
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,639
think i'm going to be signing up for

1455
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,200
that one

1456
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:21,039
we'll see where my power runs out but it

1457
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,439
hasn't run out yet

1458
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:25,759
so it's a very popular course and i

1459
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,838
think it's that way because i really aim

1460
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,839
it at the needs of the students i'm not

1461
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,920
focused on my needs

1462
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,719
it's easy for me to do the way i'm doing

1463
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,440
it and i like that that certainly is fun

1464
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:37,358
but

1465
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,000
it is a boatload of work particularly

1466
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,239
with all those plants flowing through

1467
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,838
people's hands all those flowers all

1468
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,000
those floral products

1469
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,920
this massive amount of work if i didn't

1470
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,280
have tas i couldn't do it

1471
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,720
and

1472
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,000
and i'm grateful for the tas that i have

1473
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,439
and then you know the fact that the

1474
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,800
students are telling us things that are

1475
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,280
useful

1476
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,119
and uh

1477
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,440
i don't do a lot of advertising but i do

1478
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,920
some this is one of the ads

1479
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,559
this finds its way onto little bulletin

1480
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,720
boards outside certain faculty members

1481
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,000
office doors strategically placed around

1482
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,318
the campus

1483
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,480
i've plastered it at the dining commons

1484
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,838
on the glass inside the glass door as

1485
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,400
they walk in

1486
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,078
and students look at it and it's sort of

1487
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
a universal appeal and then once they

1488
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,599
realize what it says

1489
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:31,200
learn to speak the language of flowers

1490
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,760
another potent term that

1491
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,519
anyway so

1492
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,359
i didn't i did initially think that this

1493
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,960
course would channel students into our

1494
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:40,880
majors

1495
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,920
i don't think that's happened

1496
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,519
i not even close

1497
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,838
i grabbed essentially student fte

1498
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,679
student credit hours that we were not

1499
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,039
catching in any other way

1500
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
and we're never going to see again in

1501
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,920
another

1502
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,118
plant science course

1503
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,559
but

1504
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,559
we got them

1505
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,640
and hopefully trained them how to use

1506
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,480

1507
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,000
with the financial problems we're having

1508
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,199
many of our law enrollment courses are

1509
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,199
being cancelled so the students are

1510
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,598
desperate for alternatives and this is

1511
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,838
filling such a void they need they need

1512
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,599
things they can put in their schedule

1513
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:19,599
and i'd be surprised if that sort of

1514
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,599
thing is not happening here as well

1515
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,039
anyway with that that's the material i

1516
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,440
wanted to present to you today and i'm

1517
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,440
open to questions

1518
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:41,400
this has been a production of cornell

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:41,400
university on the web at cornell.edu
