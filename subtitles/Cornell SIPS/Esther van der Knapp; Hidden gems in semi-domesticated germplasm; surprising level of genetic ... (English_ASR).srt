1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,039
and it's really really nice to be back

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,079
in Ithaca and because all the work that

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,739
I'm going to tell you today started like

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,538
one floor up I think in this corner in

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,339
Steve's lap and yiping and I were

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,439
postdocs there around the same time so

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,820
that's where we connect it's wonderful

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
to have met with some of you already

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,198
this morning I look forward to meeting

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
others this afternoon and I had a great

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,380
time with The Graduate students over

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,379
lunch so it's been a nice visit so I'm

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,000
gonna start off this uh to thank

16
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:45,058
actually

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,799
um the the team that we've assembled

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,979
over the last

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,679
well it started in 2015 was funded by a

20
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,679
plan genome Grant

21
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:58,500
and it it had number of of uh of copies

22
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,979
on this project including

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,019
um a group in Valencia and in Spain uh

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,560
that provided The Germ Pleasant that I'm

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,159
gonna talk about today uh then uh in

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,659
Massachusetts with Anna casedo who did a

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,479
lot of The evolutionary analysis

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,979
together with hamit razifert who was a

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,079
postdoc here I don't think he's here but

30
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,599
I did I think he's left but he's about

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,420
he followed up after Anna's lap being

32
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,158
post-doc in Margaret Frank's lab of

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,618
course we always worked with Lucas and

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,380
Nama here at Cornell or at Boyce

35
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:35,299
Thompson Institute on depositing all our

36
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:39,840
research at the Seoul genomics Network

37
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,460
website database and we've always worked

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,520
with Faye and we had a really productive

39
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,139
collaboration with Faye and Ying Wang at

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,819
Mississippi State although he just

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,759
recently moved to to University of

42
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,359
Florida where a paper that we published

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,599
last year on the evolution of small rnas

44
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,219
non-coding rnas in in tomato

45
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,158
in tomato so the evolution of

46
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,438
populations of small rnas

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,899
I've worked for many years with Sophia

48
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,780
Visa at the College of Worcester that's

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,539
where I was for 14 years while I had was

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,360
at Ohio State and she's always been my

51
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,400
Outreach component and she still is on

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
on current project and some of the work

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,959
that I'll present today was actually

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,640
done done by her group and then last but

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,159
not least of course at the University of

56
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,039
Florida I collaborate extensively with

57
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,639
Denise steaman in Harry Cleese lab in

58
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,159
particular with Elizabeth Frick

59
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,958
who worked on volatile analysis on this

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,840
project and in my lab at the University

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,539
of Georgia I worked on the morphology

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,580
initially on fruit size particularly and

63
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,919
specifically Alexis Ramos is a picture

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,019
of him in the right-hand corner with an

65
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,878
outstanding Master student who did who

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,159
did all the initial hard work on this

67
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,439
project uh the research I'm going to

68
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,019
talk about today was done by by

69
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,539
Elizabeth Frick or Libby Frick and then

70
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,900
two people in my lab Lara Pereira a

71
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,979
postdoc uh who recently went back to uh

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,480
Europe and a graduate student

73
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:13,079
whose work I'm actually going to present

74
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,878
today and he is about to graduate

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,700
although I wish he never graduates

76
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,620
because he's too valuable

77
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:22,018
so what is this collection what's the

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,420
Hidden Gem part about so this varitome

79
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,400
collection are kind of uh hinted to uh

80
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,378
about that already about the name so we

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,780
call it the varitome collection it

82
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:35,518
consists of a number of fully wild

83
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,860
species accessions the salon elepholium

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,319
um about 20 accessions so it's not not

85
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,420
extensive but then the biggest part of

86
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,018
this collection is comprised of solanum

87
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:49,139
like a person sarasi for me or SLC which

88
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,900
ranges uh with successions they arrange

89
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,878
in fruit size from fruits that are as

90
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,640
small as being Penelope volume to as

91
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,939
large as fully cultivated tomato and we

92
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:04,098
have approximately 120x sessions of SLC

93
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:06,539
and then a few uh very ancestral SLL

94
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:09,359
fully cultivated types that were

95
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,900
collected in Mexico by by the way by the

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,840
group in Valencia

97
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,019
yeah so um what you can do this is work

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,199
done by Hamid what you can do is uh you

99
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,000
can determine the relationship uh uh

100
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,978
among these sub populations based on

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,620
whole genome sequences and you see

102
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:31,560
there's a phylogenetic tree here uh

103
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,500
which I don't want you to get too

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,120
um too much uh carried away well you

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,319
cannot read this anyway but these are

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,139
the different colors or actually

107
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,000
different subgroups of pimpanellifolium

108
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,240
and so the peepin elephone from

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,939
northerner northern Ecuador is most

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,000
closely related to the SLC from Ecuador

111
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:53,100
then we have here the soc from Peru SLC

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,519
from Summer 10 and then here in this

113
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,400
lighter orange is uh SLC that are

114
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:03,359
transitional from Central America moving

115
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:05,698
out of Ecuador uh in towards Mexico and

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,220
then we have here a cluster of SLC from

117
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,919
Mexico and last but not least the fully

118
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,320
cultivated types the SLL and so if you

119
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,839
do diversity analysis on this subpopular

120
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,019
patients you see that the what's in the

121
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,179
boxed area here is that the SLC from

122
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:24,659
Ecuador and the SLC from Peru have as

123
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,240
much diversity as uh the the fully wild

124
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,580
relatives of the Pimpin elephone from

125
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,978
Peru and from Ecuador so this is

126
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,859
obviously a great source

127
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:37,680
um for for at least genetic variation

128
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,960
and hopefully also trade variation

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,879
and you can see that the SLL here at the

130
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,198
end the genetic diversity is much much

131
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,959
lower

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,160
so this is very generalized what are the

133
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,560
traits that uh uh we we focus on during

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
uh you know

135
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,220
during during domestication we did in

136
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
the past you know and which are still

137
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,300
very important traits for crop

138
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,579
Improvement and many of you know I have

139
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,500
worked a lot on fruit shape and fruit

140
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,899
size so that would be this category here

141
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,300
produce shape and morphology but today's

142
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:14,159
talk is going to be more on the flavor

143
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,199
and and Aroma and so what is aroma and I

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,840
I'm sure that Harry is given talks here

145
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,460
and he he would present a paper a figure

146
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,758
like this

147
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:27,478
um so when you uh taste anything that

148
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,660
you eat uh you you you're you're the

149
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:33,240
sensory neurons on on your the sensory

150
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,400
receptors in on your tongue they sense

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,860
the sugars and the acids but what what

152
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,258
you're also experiencing is the

153
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,939
volatiles that are released uh as you're

154
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,740
eating the the product either through

155
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,439
directly through the nose or through

156
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,538
your throat and that's the focus of of

157
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,680
our research is actually the volatile

158
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:55,439
Aroma that are released by ripe tomatoes

159
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,120
and so I I decided to put a few pictures

160
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,279
of it in for the graduate students

161
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,620
because all sounds really fun but

162
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,138
there's a lot of hard work uh involved

163
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,660
in getting the data that I'm showing you

164
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,418
today this is from a field site in

165
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,400
Florida in Northern Florida uh it's an

166
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,978
hour north of Gainesville so this is

167
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,079
where Denise tiemann grows all their

168
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,599
tomatoes and here we are collecting

169
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,598
tomatoes and you see they are just so

170
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,879
overgrown they sometimes are taller than

171
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,699
some of the graduate students the plants

172
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,319
are growing incredibly wild and it's

173
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,960
sometimes a little bit of a chore to

174
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,000
find the fruits but we do and then we

175
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,519
take the fruits to for the volatile

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,279
analysis we take the fruits to Denise's

177
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,379
lab here a couple of pictures of from

178
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,559
their Labs so they're in the upper

179
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,839
left-hand corner is uh is Zach who's

180
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,699
weighing the tomatoes sorting them and

181
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,679
weighing them and then cutting them in

182
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,960
smaller pieces they then on the picture

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,300
on the right you see Denise there and

184
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,219
you're seen from my lab stuffing them

185
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,439
into glass tubes and putting rubber

186
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,280
stoppers on the end and then in the

187
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,519
bottom uh left corner is where they get

188
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:08,399
hooked up to

189
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:11,279
a system where inert air is blown over

190
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,038
over the tube over the tomatoes in the

191
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,258
tube and then at the end it's not shown

192
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:19,199
here but at the end of this stopper here

193
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,479
there's a column and and the volatiles

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,478
are actually uh

195
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,659
accumulate on that column and then after

196
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,878
an hour of the of the the fruits here

197
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,919
emitting the volatiles we collected The

198
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,700
Columns and then we elude the volatiles

199
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,679
they then I run on a gcms for a group to

200
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,620
get a general to generate a chromatogram

201
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,538
like this and so that's uh it's fairly

202
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,580
labor intensive to do all this volatile

203
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:47,580
analysis and then the chromatograms

204
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,019
often are also hand edited uh for

205
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,420
accuracy

206
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,339
and so there are major volatile Pathways

207
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:56,099
in tomato a lot of the work has been

208
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,560
done in Denise and Harry's lab and so

209
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,980
this is a figure that's modified from

210
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,458
one of their reviews and so uh there's a

211
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,019
branch chain amino acid derived

212
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:09,239
volatiles there's the acetate Ester

213
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,580
derived volatiles there's the

214
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,919
lipid-derived volatiles there's the

215
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,959
phenopropanoids

216
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,120
um and then there are the phenolics and

217
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,338
then last but not least carotenoids also

218
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,959
uh release uh you know corruption or

219
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,399
derived volatiles are also very

220
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,739
important

221
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,019
so the many different Pathways that

222
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,680
contribute to the volatile Aroma of the

223
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,620
fruit

224
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:34,259
and so from this collection we obtained

225
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,778
information about 60 different or more

226
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,639
than 60 different volatiles and they

227
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,860
fall into different classes you know

228
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,458
there's so many acetate Esters were

229
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,278
collected Etc and then what we did is we

230
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,979
looked at the genetic uh uh the

231
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,139
different subgroups and and Quantified

232
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,180
the different uh volatiles from the

233
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,059
different Pathways and what you can see

234
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:59,519
on the panel a is that you see that in

235
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,559
green is the pimpanellifolium volatile

236
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,679
profile in the principal component spot

237
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:07,739
and then in blue circled already uh

238
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:11,039
ancestral SLL so they are they are

239
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,860
separated the SLC in red are just are

240
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,579
are either as similar as pimpy or as

241
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,320
similar as the SLL but very clearly what

242
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,139
you see here there's a shift in volatile

243
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,320
profile from the heirloom slash

244
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,539
domesticated type so more modern

245
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,459
material that's circled in Gray and then

246
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,980
in panel B you can see a different

247
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,958
volatile groups and and how they

248
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,959
accumulate for example in green there's

249
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,359
the lipid the lipid-derived volatiles in

250
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,939
the soc from Summer 10 which is a region

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,459
in in Peru are have a very much

252
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,100
increased over that of the fully uh wild

253
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,578
species so there's enormous variation in

254
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,159
volatile accumulation that is different

255
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:55,979
subgroups from fully wild to SLC to

256
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,259
fully cultivated

257
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,820
so of course if you have genome sequence

258
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,159
we can do a genome-wide Association

259
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,959
study with this we did it specifically

260
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,199
with the vaditone collection because our

261
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:12,299
our sequences were good and this is work

262
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:15,720
from Manoj in my lab and uh we used uh

263
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:17,759
initially used just Snips and an older

264
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,399
version of the Tomato genome and later

265
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,500
we went back and redid the analysis also

266
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,659
interrogating indels and structural

267
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,980
variants and this is where I want to

268
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:29,699
point out that actually structural

269
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,980
variant least was compiled by uh by

270
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,379
Sophia Visa by using lumpy and then

271
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,139
various other ways of

272
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,419
um assessing whether this structural

273
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,278
variants were real or novels you get a

274
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,559
lot of art false positives but that's

275
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,759
actually our original structural variant

276
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:50,399
list and then you create a Manhattan

277
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,100
plot and we keep it separate right now

278
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,659
for Snips in Belgian as well and in

279
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,899
total of 652 variants variety identified

280
00:11:56,659 --> 00:12:03,120
for many of the volatiles not all

281
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,500
and so that's a lot and this is what it

282
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,940
looks like when you plot all these

283
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,039
variants on the genomes it's basically

284
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,660
everywhere so I find a part of the

285
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,000
genome that's not

286
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,519
um not corresponding or not contributing

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,639
to any of the volatiles volatile

288
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,639
production so they're coded here by

289
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,819
caller which indicates which class

290
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,860
they're in or by Circle or triangle or

291
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,500
Square and that means if it's an Intel

292
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,539
snip or a structural variant or SV

293
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,919
and so now we wanted to reduce the

294
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:36,120
number of loci because what do you do

295
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:39,000
when you have 652 variants so one way to

296
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,600
do that was to establish establish a LD

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,019
and a genome-wide we uh the average is

298
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,600
we estimated that at 200 KB

299
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,100
um and but of course uh there's also

300
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,860
regions of the central mirror about the

301
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,778
ldus would be much larger and regions in

302
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,459
the eugromatic part that are where the

303
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:00,419
LD is much smaller but we took an

304
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:02,638
estimate of of 200 KB so a snip if

305
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,679
there's 200 or you know 150 KB away

306
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,060
there's another snip we consider that to

307
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,759
be one

308
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:12,299
um one Locus and that if you then Focus

309
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:15,659
only on the euchromatic variants then uh

310
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:18,559
it narrows it down to about 100 loci

311
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:21,778
that collapsed because there's either

312
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,879
several variants in that region or the

313
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:26,100
multiple variant uh sorry multiple

314
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,559
volatiles mapping to that same region

315
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,899
and then there's still 184 low sided

316
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,619
display only single evidence so one

317
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:38,278
variant and one volatile

318
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,078
so we in in the meantime we had also uh

319
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,958
started to create biparental mapping

320
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,599
populations initially primarily to map

321
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,759
fruitway genes and and clone them but

322
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,820
Denise I would always look at the

323
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,860
parental volatile profiles like oh these

324
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,800
are cool these are kind of segregate for

325
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,959
volatile X Y and Z so we have four

326
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,838
populations

327
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:03,179
a reasonable size for an F2 uh we got a

328
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,120
lot of variants because we uh we're

329
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:08,638
using GBS to genotype and then we did

330
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,820
composite interval mapping in these four

331
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,778
populations to to identify a number of

332
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:19,740
qtls in uh from these four by parental

333
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:23,278
mapping populations and so we found that

334
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,200
enough of all those qtls found from uh

335
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,320
from the composite interval mapping or

336
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,240
the Sim we found it about half actually

337
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,500
overlap with G was low size so that's

338
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,879
helpful

339
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,799
so now I want to mention uh what we're

340
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,439
doing now and it's still a work in

341
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,659
progress uh but we're of course there

342
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,260
are so many loci to select from we still

343
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:48,600
have nearly 300 from G Was Alone

344
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,278
um of course uh the one reason not to

345
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,579
follow up on the locus if it's already

346
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,919
cloned so there were a few uh genes uh

347
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:58,198
that were identified that are already

348
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,719
cloned so we're not following up on

349
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,578
those so we want to look at novoloci and

350
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,699
then we took several factors into

351
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,919
account and not it's it's it's uh it's

352
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:10,259
kind of a hybrid of what was more

353
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,740
important but one of them was evidence

354
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,620
so if you have uh only one snip that is

355
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,198
barely significantly associated with a

356
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,740
uh a volatile and it's only one volatile

357
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,899
that shows up uh uh at that Locus and

358
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,639
well maybe that's a less

359
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,799
um well it's probably important but

360
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
let's not focus on that so looking at

361
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,519
evidence meaning like do we get a snip

362
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,399
and another snip maybe several

363
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,620
structural variants associated with that

364
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,139
Locus and or are there multiple

365
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,639
volatiles

366
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:44,100
linked to that logo so it's a production

367
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,159
of of the levels of of multiple

368
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,259
volatiles uh controlled by that Locus so

369
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,179
and then looking at the significance too

370
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,759
so let's say we get one snip and it's

371
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:56,278
incredibly significant uh just because

372
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,958
it's only one snip We're Not Gonna toss

373
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,778
it aside we certainly would like to

374
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,219
follow up on that Locus as well and if

375
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:05,578
there is overlap with the mapping

376
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:09,120
population it is very helpful because

377
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,919
then we can have other genetic uh ways

378
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,100
to confirm the locus

379
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,719
so uh so so we narrow down our the

380
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,300
number of low side we want to follow up

381
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,600
on and then Manoj developed this

382
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:24,059
pipeline to make an uh attempt at least

383
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,060
to do some candidate Gene identification

384
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:30,899
without going through each Locus bio

385
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:34,979
well by you know by end one you know two

386
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,980
300 KB one uh Gene at the time so what

387
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,240
he did he created a pipeline that would

388
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,820
interrogate the expression profile of

389
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,639
these genes in public databases as well

390
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,139
as the biochemical annotation and with

391
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,500
that the last part the biochemical

392
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:52,079
annotations where Denise always comes in

393
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,059
and and helps us out and so then you end

394
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,919
up with a set of loci that have

395
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,919
candidate genes and but there's also a

396
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,419
lot that do not have candidate genes

397
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,659
so I'm going to give you an example

398
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:06,058
about the acetate Ester pathway and the

399
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,879
two genes that were already cloned many

400
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:12,119
years ago are a carboxyl esterase on

401
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,880
chromosome one and an alcohol acyl

402
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,798
transformation chromosome eight and you

403
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,500
see the pathway there's pretty simple as

404
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,019
a feedback loop where the carboxylase

405
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,660
Rays

406
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:29,400
conversations into alcohols and the a81

407
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:32,600
does the opposite so do we find a cxe1

408
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,038
and a81 in our G bus and yes we do

409
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,139
they're they're indicated here on the

410
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,538
slide and you can see there's a lot of

411
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,280
variants still

412
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:44,220
there's a lot of other variants that are

413
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,279
underlying unknown genes so here you

414
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,779
have one example for example where

415
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,139
there's a lot of evidence you see

416
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:54,418
there's like a snip and an indel and and

417
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,100
then potentially also multiple volatiles

418
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,780
from the estate as the pathway because

419
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:00,359
it's a lot of dots there

420
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:04,019
and so that one actually shows up here

421
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:08,038
uh also circled in Red so that's a a

422
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:10,500
possible uh candidate Gene underlying uh

423
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,720
volatile production at that Locus and

424
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,480
here you see an example of of the list

425
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,120
of candidate genes that we've identified

426
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,480
in purple highlighted in purple is a

427
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:24,538
givas Locus that overlaps with a

428
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,720
composite interval mapping Locus or a by

429
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:29,700
parental cross Locus so that one on the

430
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,100
top the alcohol dehydrogenase is a

431
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,779
really good candidate Gene

432
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,599
so now another example is the

433
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,240
phenopropenoid pathway and I'll tell you

434
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,159
a little bit more about that so in that

435
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,900
case there is already multiple genes

436
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,019
identified

437
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,259
um five in total I'm gonna talk more

438
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:51,900
about the methyl salicylate uh pathway

439
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:55,259
uh in the next part of the second part

440
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,559
of my talk but the genes cloned are uh

441
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:00,779
are already indicated here so salicylic

442
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,480
acid gets converted by salicylic acid

443
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,058
methyl transferase into methyl

444
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,720
salicylate and methyl salicylate then

445
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:13,859
gets conjugated by glycocil transferases

446
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,019
into a DI glucoside molecule and that

447
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:18,899
then gets converted further to a

448
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:22,319
trisectoride conjugate by another

449
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,480
glyphosol transferase called nsgt1

450
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,939
there's a lot of acronyms non-smokey

451
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,460
glucosal transferase but that's the

452
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,080
pathway of salicylic acid so a lot of

453
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,660
these genes are very important in this

454
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:37,139
pathway and have been clone do they show

455
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,419
up in our jivas some of them so mess for

456
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,960
sure and that's uh the gene that was

457
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:46,080
recently cloned uh by Libby in in Harry

458
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,000
and Denise's lab so this is why she

459
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,659
actually focused on that there was a she

460
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,599
was a variant uh right on top of the of

461
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,320
the locus and then nsgt-1 is identified

462
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,058
as well as the salicylic acid metal

463
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,579
transferase but the other two genes

464
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,660
there's no uh variants associated with

465
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:05,879
those

466
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,140
and so the candidate genes for the

467
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,640
fennel proponoid uh uh uh

468
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,820
volatiles at the Divas low-siders again

469
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,340
one that is common in both uh the G was

470
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:19,619
and by parental mapping population and

471
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:22,859
that's a uh it's annotated as a new DX

472
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:25,079
Hydro loss hydrolase 17 and it's known

473
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,319
from other systems to be involved in

474
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,839
systemic acquired resistance so that's

475
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,519
actually phenopropanoids are part of

476
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,699
that pathway

477
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:39,240
and again a couple of other ones uh

478
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:43,200
including an interesting uh an E8 like

479
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:47,038
uh Gene on chromosome 3.

480
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,740
I think Jim probably knows that one

481
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,319
so how can breeders use this knowledge

482
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,079
uh and or other way to put it like how

483
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,759
can we harness this genetic diversity uh

484
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,819
and and towards crop Improvement then

485
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,879
have to give a couple of uh reminders

486
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:06,240
here because uh the one thing

487
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,340
um this this research is is cool to do

488
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,259
and but how how practical is it at this

489
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,000
point well we need to know first what

490
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,679
are the Improvement alleles have we can

491
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,779
figure that out from the data that we

492
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,120
have a little bit more study and we'll

493
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,099
be good uh we also have to know about

494
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,798
the desirability of that particular

495
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:25,558
volatile so a lot of that work has been

496
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,779
done uh in the nice and Harry's lab in

497
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:30,178
the past so we do have some idea about

498
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:32,099
volatiles that are generally liked and

499
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,840
volatiles that are generally not liked

500
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,000
but then there's also something about

501
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,918
the quantity and the combination of the

502
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,558
other volatiles that third bullet point

503
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,720
uh it's uh you know it's you have to

504
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,700
combine uh you have to think about the

505
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,500
combination of all the volatiles that

506
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,080
are accumulating

507
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,440
um and so you know Aroma is actually

508
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:55,139
quite complex X we can make it simple to

509
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,659
split them up in different Pathways but

510
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,640
then you know if you have a highly liked

511
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,000
volatile and then you're like okay I'm

512
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,280
gonna now select for the highest level

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,519
uh in my next breeding line is it's then

514
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,079
still you know liked is it or maybe got

515
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,940
too much of it

516
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,639
um so that that is something to consider

517
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,519
so we're still a ways off for uh uh to

518
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,559
to to to use this information for crop

519
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,779
Improvement we have to realize that

520
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,178
there are other things coming in play

521
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,339
and the last but not least what tastes

522
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,740
good to some people in tomato and other

523
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,019
other fruits and vegetables it might not

524
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,900
be good for everyone not everybody likes

525
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,480
the same type of tomato so it's it's

526
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,120
still a ways off but um I will show give

527
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,298
you an example of how I think we can we

528
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:45,000
can make use of this data to some extent

529
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:46,859
so here I'm coming back to methyl

530
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,500
salicylate this is the chemical

531
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:51,959
structure and it's produced in the pheno

532
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,298
Pro openoid pathway and it's a really

533
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,579
important pathway in tomato

534
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,500
it's responsible for an aroma called

535
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,379
Wintergreen and that probably doesn't

536
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,200
sound very appealing in tomato it's not

537
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,659
that's why people do not like it it's

538
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,720
it's not associated with It's associated

539
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:13,500
with low lighting so this is again work

540
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,419
done in in Harry and Denise's lab but it

541
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,700
is quite important for pathogen

542
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,059
signaling and stress signaling by the

543
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,798
plant so it's not uh it's not a pathway

544
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:24,899
we want to just eliminate that would not

545
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,519
be good so this is again the

546
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,860
biosynthesis and the conjugation of

547
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,740
methyl salicylate I kind of alluded to

548
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:35,219
earlier uh is the salicylic acid methyl

549
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:38,659
transferase the UDP lupusil transferases

550
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:41,819
that converted to a diet

551
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:43,440
saccharide and then the nsdt-1 it

552
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:47,038
converts it to a tricycle rights and

553
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,880
that is irreversible if nsdt1 is not

554
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,980
present then the dichloposide conjugate

555
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,559
can be converted back to methyl

556
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,500
salicylate and then the methyl esterase

557
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:01,619
is the focus of the this second part of

558
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,319
the talk uh come into play and they can

559
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:06,719
convert uh methyl salicylate back to

560
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,960
salicylic acid

561
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,759
so methyl salicylate levels are uh are

562
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,880
varying in the bodycon collection but

563
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,379
not extremely most varieties or most

564
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,900
accessions I should say these are not

565
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,240
varieties most accessions produce very

566
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,240
low levels

567
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,500
um even the fully wild species produce

568
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
low levels but there are a few

569
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,640
accessions that produce fairly high

570
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:33,178
levels as you see in panel a then in

571
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,000
panel B you can see uh the levels from

572
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,400
the of methyl salicylate produced by the

573
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,159
different subpopulation and you see that

574
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,019
the SP from northern Ecuador produces

575
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,919
significantly higher levels in the other

576
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,200
uh pimpanelifolium clusters and also

577
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,659
then it produces much higher levels than

578
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,360
SLC from Mexico for example

579
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:57,480
so the SP from northern Ecuador is

580
00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:00,298
particularly producing high levels of

581
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,679
methyl salicylate and SLC Ecuador as

582
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,058
well

583
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,860
so

584
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:09,720
um I alluded to earlier there was a

585
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:13,259
major jivas uh variant very significant

586
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:17,220
he was a variant right on the on the

587
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:19,740
locus I think it has also a structural

588
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,720
variant in here somewhere

589
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,359
um and I'll get to structural variant

590
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,298
variation at the locus in a minute so

591
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:29,038
um we found four different genes mess

592
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:32,519
one through Mass four

593
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:36,000
and what Libby did and also with some

594
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:39,058
work done in our lab we created a a mess

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,980
one knockout uh in the money maker

596
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:43,379
background a Libby here shows this in

597
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,778
the Brandywine background if you knock

598
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,299
out mess one by crispr you get

599
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,740
significantly higher levels of methyl

600
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,740
salicylate and that's what you're

601
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,440
expecting if you let me actually go back

602
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,159
to the pathway if you

603
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,400
um

604
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,159
if you knock out mess one you will start

605
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,860
accumulating methyl salicylate

606
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,799
so you uh yeah that's that's what we're

607
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:09,719
expecting so you knock out mess one uh

608
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,759
we get much higher levels of methyl

609
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,159
salicylate so mess one is quite

610
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,500
important and so what we did in my lab

611
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,799
is is looking at the hepatype diversity

612
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,140
and this is was for us uh quite uh

613
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,500
astonishing because this is only based

614
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,778
on structural variance and uh that alone

615
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,298
and the basis of this was again with the

616
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:32,640
data set that Sophia Visa created and

617
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,980
later we confirmed it with the Oxford

618
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,038
nanopore sequences from a Zach lipmann's

619
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,919
group but we found up to nine different

620
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:44,038
Apple types in Red fruited Tomato alone

621
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,679
and it's not that the wild species all

622
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:51,839
are part of one haplotype actually SP

623
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,240
found you know SP accessions are found

624
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,658
in in I think four or five or six

625
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,120
haplotypes so even SP itself the fully

626
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,159
wild relative there's there's a lot of

627
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:06,058
genetic variation

628
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,580
now this uh this graph is uh uh can be

629
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,278
interpreted as that the darker blue

630
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:13,199
boxes are uh

631
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,839
to best of our knowledge they look like

632
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,298
full length coding no weird you know

633
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,579
premature stop-codone genes we think

634
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:22,500
they're functional uh if they're light

635
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,418
blue uh there's there's a couple of

636
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,079
mutations in there including premature

637
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:30,538
subcodones or a frame shift that uh uh

638
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,038
lead to uh probably truncated protein

639
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:36,480
and probably these are non-functional

640
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:39,900
and then the the the the pink one or

641
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,700
peach color I guess uh mess three that's

642
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,380
an unusual one there's only one

643
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,500
haplotype where mesh three is full

644
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,659
length but all the other haplotypes that

645
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,058
have some S3 they're actually truncated

646
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,159
and there are shorter versions of that

647
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:55,619
protein but Libby has shown actually

648
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,020
that Nest three the shorter version has

649
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,178
still some activity but it's not as good

650
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,519
as mes1 so we think mess three in the

651
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,140
pink is still functional

652
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,519
um yeah

653
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,799
so

654
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,200
um now we can of course associate the

655
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:13,558
the mess and the nsdg-1 hypnotized with

656
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,620
methyl salicylate levels and uh and this

657
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:21,298
is for uh mes1 and panel a where you see

658
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:23,219
haplotype 2 is particularly uh you know

659
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:25,200
the accessions belonging to carrying

660
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,079
that haplot I've produced particular

661
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,240
high levels of methyl salicylate and

662
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,278
significantly higher for example than

663
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,700
hypotypes six and seven

664
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:38,038
and then for nsdt1 based on structural

665
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,120
variance alone uh this was work we did

666
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:45,298
with Mike Mike shots and Michael launch

667
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,500
and and Zach Libman in the paper cited

668
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,019
here

669
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,778
um this the the you can find up to five

670
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:53,519
different hippo types of nsdt one of

671
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:55,558
which three uh one to three are

672
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,139
considered functional because there's

673
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:01,619
still a functional protein there and

674
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:04,740
four doesn't does uh does have I I

675
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:08,099
doesn't have has one copy sort of but

676
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,839
it's not functioning as well in aprotype

677
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,959
5 is definitely a knockout where both

678
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,879
copies of the gene are eliminated

679
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,058
so now of course we can look at the

680
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,840
interaction between uh the mess and the

681
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:23,700
nsdt1 Apple types and uh here you see uh

682
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,579
the the nine different Apple types of

683
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,519
mass one those are the the nine uh

684
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:32,158
um uh squares and then in color whether

685
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,099
they have nst21 hypotype uh one two

686
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,799
three or four or five and you see here

687
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:40,319
haplotype two the one that leads to

688
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:42,658
significantly higher levels of methyl

689
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:45,839
salicylate the levels increase further

690
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:50,460
if you have an inactive version of nsdt1

691
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:53,879
contrary here with type 6 and 7 for for

692
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,679
mesh you see that the there's there's

693
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,320
still a they're accumulating very low

694
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,640
levels of methyl salicylate no matter

695
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:05,700
what uh the uh the locus or the alleles

696
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,840
at nsgt1

697
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,058
so

698
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,918
um just to remind you here's the pathway

699
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,440
again if you knock out mess one and you

700
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,080
knock out nsgt1 you really are able to

701
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,640
increase the levels of methyl salicylate

702
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,199
a lot

703
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,059
so

704
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,480
um I showed you this slide this slide

705
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:27,720
before uh to the best of our knowledge

706
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,058
um uh you know the blue indicates that

707
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,980
uh the blue collar indicates it is a

708
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:34,678
functional Gene and most of these

709
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,220
haplotypes seem to be able to produce a

710
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,200
functional copy of the mes1 Gene and

711
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,980
um but you know I showed you too that

712
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,659
haplotype 2 is particularly uh uh you

713
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,819
know associated with high levels of

714
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:50,520
methyl salicylate suggesting that that

715
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,558
hypotype is actually non-functional but

716
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,918
the gene mess one still looks functional

717
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,220
so what's going on well then we did some

718
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,259
expression analysis just q r to PCR

719
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,538
where on on the top you see about six or

720
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:07,319
seven accessions that belong to helper

721
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:09,839
type 6 and you see the levels of methyl

722
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,439
salicylate are really low

723
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:16,199
um and then hepatype 2 is below is also

724
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,659
six successions see that the levels of

725
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,538
methyl salicylate are very high and you

726
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:24,000
can clearly see uh by eye here that in

727
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:27,119
hypnotype 2 None of the mesh genes are

728
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,480
even expressed uh where whereas in

729
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,398
haplotype six uh three of the four mesh

730
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,919
genes are expressed and particularly

731
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,439
mess one but also Mass three so that

732
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,740
explains why Mass 2 is is knocked out

733
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,080
even though we don't know why the genes

734
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,000
are just not expressed

735
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,639
but uh yeah

736
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,220
and so then of course we know where all

737
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,340
these accessions were collected uh they

738
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,579
were collected in South America and uh

739
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:59,759
Central America in Mexico and so here is

740
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:01,500
a graph that shows uh uh where the

741
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,500
different HEPA types of of the mess

742
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,619
Locus were collected so again the the

743
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,558
first uh block here

744
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:13,918
um is is uh is the five or six different

745
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:17,519
HEPA types of of SP so it's a lot of

746
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,860
variation in Sp alone uh and the darker

747
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,079
blue indicates the hypotype 2 the

748
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:25,139
non-functional haplotype you see that

749
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,359
that's quite well selected against uh

750
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,960
during domestication and it's it's it's

751
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:33,058
rarely found in in cultivated or well

752
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,000
not in our collection but also not in

753
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:38,759
ancestral SLL and instead in the zestro

754
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,740
SLL you have hypotype six and seven that

755
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,278
are very prevalent

756
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,980
and then it is also color coded on the

757
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,798
map basically so the blue haplotype 2

758
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,419
you can see it's found here in Ecuador

759
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:52,918
along the coast but also in the

760
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,399
mountains

761
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,159
and this is the situation for nsgt1

762
00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:01,678
where uh the functional uh appetypes one

763
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,200
through three are found in all the SPX

764
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,919
sessions but then during domestication

765
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,960
more and more uh we we didn't select for

766
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,960
the most functional hypotypes at this

767
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,019
Locus and so the the least functional

768
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,480
the one that clearly uh uh

769
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,700
non-functionals have prototype five and

770
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,380
you also find these in roughly the same

771
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:27,120
uh area uh in in Ecuador and then you

772
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,159
can superimpose that with levels of

773
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,398
methyl salicylate that were found in

774
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,080
these uh these accessions in Florida and

775
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,058
you see the accessions that produce high

776
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,099
levels of methyl salicylate are found

777
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:40,740
again in Ecuador corresponding to a

778
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:44,759
non-functional allele of nsdt1 and a

779
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:49,319
non-functional allele of mess

780
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:52,980
so as I'm wrapping up this presentation

781
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:55,859
um I just uh wanted to uh you know

782
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,200
summarize all our findings with mess and

783
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:01,079
mess and nsgt1 we present a range of

784
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,600
alleles in red fruited tomatoes

785
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:06,418
um and more more than I thought was was

786
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:10,019
uh was possible but volatiles I guess

787
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:12,539
has enormous variation out there so we

788
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:16,199
selected it very much for a functional

789
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:20,219
allele at mess uh and a non-functional

790
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,960
allele at nsgt1 during domestication I

791
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:25,378
don't know why that was

792
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,179
um I could I could hypothesize but this

793
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:29,598
is the opposite of what was found in Sp

794
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,280
I don't know why that is either

795
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,440
interesting questions uh to to think

796
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,960
about and so

797
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,700
um but what I was told by one of my

798
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,619
former graduate students who works for

799
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,019
Bayer now he said now but most are Elite

800
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,740
tomato varieties are all carrying the

801
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:48,300
functional allele of NSG you want so

802
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,219
breeders in companies have clearly

803
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,320
selected for a functional allulated

804
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,819
Locus to keep the levels of methyl

805
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,159
salicylate low

806
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,740
so the geographic distribution of course

807
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,420
of these alleles in Ecuador suggest that

808
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:05,579
there's maybe a need for accessions

809
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:09,599
in Ecuador to carry higher levels of

810
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:14,098
methyl salicylate perhaps to fend off uh

811
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,380
insect herbivores or or other diseases

812
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,820
um yeah or other diseases it might be

813
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,200
important for the life cycle of the

814
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,480
plant

815
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,179
and so with that I'll just finish up

816
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,000
with this uh slide again thanking the

817
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:29,519
the folks in the lab in particular uh my

818
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,619
my graduate student Manors who's pretty

819
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,380
much his entire thesis was presented

820
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,900
here today and uh and Lara Pereira who's

821
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,780
done a lot of work with on that project

822
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:43,440
and then Libby and Denise at the

823
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,800
University of Florida and with that I am

824
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,079
happy to take any questions

825
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,519
and I usually go over time it's like wow

826
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,339
this is the first time I'm like early

827
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,338
apologize I didn't want to get out of it

828
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:01,739
yeah

829
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:04,259
how often does this situation with MES

830
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:06,598
happen with other volatile

831
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,000
um clouds of traits in the scale like

832
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,500
it's very common is it pretty frequent

833
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,880
where they're kind of diversity related

834
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,880
to the agronomic like

835
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,940
um

836
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,338
I guess maybe storage or light

837
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,220
capabilities

838
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:26,759
so your question is how often do you

839
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:29,699
find this level of variation at the

840
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,400
locus how often do bowels attract

841
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,739
negatively or maybe foreign

842
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,320
oh

843
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,838
well good question uh so how often

844
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,599
what's the link between uh you know good

845
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,380
tasting tomato and yield I think that's

846
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,940
the translation

847
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,960
yeah so

848
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,858
um

849
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,800
um

850
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:55,559
well there is a correlation and uh you

851
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,720
know you can show that larger Tomatoes

852
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,320
tend to have

853
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:03,598
less flavor and and the fruit quality is

854
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,338
going down and actually Denise has shown

855
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,880
that

856
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:12,719
in their work uh the idea is though that

857
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,700
um that that's possibly caused by uh the

858
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,199
lack of knowledge of where the loci are

859
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,659
that you need to keep to have a good

860
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:22,319
tasting tomato

861
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:24,358
so just to you know to analyze volatiles

862
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,300
uh you have to have specialized

863
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:29,039
equipment it's very time consuming and

864
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,200
you need a really good biochemist on the

865
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,119
project to to figure it out because the

866
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,419
grammatogram I showed you was the best

867
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,160
ever now most of them are not that clear

868
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,500
it's like there's a lot of

869
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,899
Denise what is this how do I measure

870
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,780
this or how do I quantify you know this

871
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,260
one is all shifted or whatever so it is

872
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:52,019
actually quite uh it's not easy to to

873
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,180
quantify the volatiles so having said

874
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,280
that you know the volatiles that uh

875
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:59,098
we're looking at are produced in such

876
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,960
low quantities that uh we we don't think

877
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,599
it act that that's it's it's it's

878
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,119
creating such a drain on the plant

879
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,859
so we think that we can you know we

880
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,559
should be able to create better tasting

881
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:12,559
tomatoes without uh compromising yields

882
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:19,320
we shall see

883
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:24,359
yeah have you tried the imputing you

884
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:28,140
know all the exactly uh and vibrators uh

885
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:30,619
Apple types onto your panels and redoing

886
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,618
the association

887
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:46,019
yeah so that its question is about uh

888
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:49,680
you know using actually that those

889
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,460
re-sequence genomes and do G was again

890
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,519
um

891
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,440
we I know so you know what we do now I

892
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,300
mean I don't want to minimize the impact

893
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,480
of that data set that's that created

894
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,180
because it's enormous every time we're a

895
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,338
new Locus first thing is like what's the

896
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,960
genome structure in well we don't always

897
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:10,440
have the parent sequence but something

898
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,300
related what's what is possible and uh

899
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,599
you know a lot of volatile loci actually

900
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,940
are uh are structural variants so we we

901
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,920
get very quickly then an idea whether

902
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,800
you know uh whether it's a structure

903
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,460
variant likely to be causative

904
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,019
um yeah no yeah we could we could redo

905
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,139
the analysis

906
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:32,940
um we we have everything set up in the

907
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:36,239
lab that all these reference genomes

908
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:39,599
like 14 or so are all there we can we

909
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:43,019
can always align the short reads to any

910
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,838
reference genome because if you take a

911
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:48,119
pimpy and you align it to the Hinds you

912
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,299
have a lot of snips we have a very nice

913
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,980
pimpy genome so it's it's helpful to

914
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,960
figure out what's going on what we do it

915
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,119
more one-on-one at the time based one

916
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,559
Mobius at the time so yeah I think we

917
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,640
can we could do that

918
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,980
it would cost just time right

919
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:08,279
my student wants to graduate

920
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:11,400
[Laughter]

921
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,500
um I think salicylic acid can prime

922
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,500
plant immune responses

923
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,900
uh and and so it kind of has a hormonal

924
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,480
function that way and I'm wondering how

925
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,338
often you are looking at these different

926
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,960
volatiles and come across something that

927
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,639
seems to have some kind of hormonal

928
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,880
function

929
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,279
yeah so uh salicylic acid and methyl

930
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,420
salicylate are definitely in the

931
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,760
phenoproponopatha is really important in

932
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,619
defense signaling

933
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,839
um

934
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,720
whether other volatiles are important in

935
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,779
defense uh

936
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,578
I don't know that answer I do know when

937
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,380
the plan when the yeah the plant is

938
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:52,800
diseased we get a different volatile

939
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:55,619
profile so we have to be really careful

940
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,480
with also when we are in the lab and

941
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,880
selecting the fruit has to be like

942
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,619
perfect fruit not too ripe because if

943
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,140
they overripe they have another volatile

944
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,720
profile so I I actually don't know the

945
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:08,219
answer to to your question

946
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,819
um

947
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,819
yeah

948
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,619
it's I actually we're creating Knockouts

949
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:19,199
in the different mesh genes wanted and I

950
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:21,260
I really wonder uh what you know

951
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,059
hopefully working in the future with

952
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,859
plantologists or so to figure out if you

953
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,019
knock out mesh 3 you know is the plant

954
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:30,480
more susceptible to

955
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,759
I know some pathogen infection and it's

956
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,740
possible there's some anecdotal

957
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,619
references about methyl salicylate

958
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:41,179
levels in in Roots and then reducing uh

959
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:43,980
CIS nematode so you know it's it's it's

960
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:46,440
possibly important the methyl salicylate

961
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,159
and Harry once said well the levels of

962
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,980
methyl salicylate have gone up in um in

963
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,319
the tomatoes that we essayed here and he

964
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,699
he thought it was because you know if

965
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,559
you have a little higher levels of

966
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:00,539
methyl salicylate you have a little bit

967
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,358
better disease resistance just general

968
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:07,679
resistance and that's possibly what

969
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,940
breed is selected for I I possibly yeah

970
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,819
have you ever eaten one of these

971
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:15,000
Wintergreen Tomatoes no but it's like

972
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,920
it's like I'm I'm yeah minty is what

973
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,079
people say I don't know what it is I

974
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,838
maybe I don't want to know but we've

975
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,640
we've tasted all these Tomatoes we uh I

976
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,320
have one postdoc with like but we would

977
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:27,598
this was the first year didn't she stop

978
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,920
it she would taste every tomato that we

979
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,760
got from the field like oh that's good

980
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,760
oh that's bad

981
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,219
foreign

982
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,149
[Music]

983
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:58,220
[Music]

984
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:58,219
I think

985
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,339
um

986
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:06,959
because it's also preference so there

987
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:10,019
was a study done in Europe I don't know

988
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,940
a decade ago and yeah yeah well and the

989
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:13,739
Italians like this type of tomato and

990
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,380
the Dutch people like another type and

991
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:19,199
they were not even overlapping so I've

992
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,119
heard also anecdotal stories of like you

993
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,559
know undergraduates in the lab like oh

994
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,680
this really tastes like a good tomato

995
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,838
but it was considered a poor tasting

996
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,759
tomato what is a tomato that you can buy

997
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,500
in the grocery stores and people are

998
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,260
familiar your young people are familiar

999
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,920
with that type of flavor so I I don't

1000
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,079
think that's so possible to create one

1001
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
um one Aroma one

1002
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,380
um

1003
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,800
yeah one one type of Aroma for for

1004
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,338
everyone but then it's it's also very uh

1005
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,019
it's not so stable right if the produce

1006
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:53,578
are longer in the store you know they're

1007
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:55,159
gonna lose some of their flavor over

1008
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:58,200
time

1009
00:43:55,159 --> 00:44:02,239
yeah oh I see I think they have the

1010
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,239
light bulbs to change their color

1011
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,440
they've read that

1012
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
yeah

1013
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:10,639
there's a lot of

1014
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,800
true

1015
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:18,180
um I don't know I think I uh perhaps in

1016
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,220
the future yeah

1017
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:22,399
I don't think I'll I'll be working on

1018
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,399
that

1019
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,440
Jim

1020
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:30,379
so I understood so with Nets you

1021
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,720
basically got a collection of alleles

1022
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:36,180
that are encoding functional genes think

1023
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,759
about expression irrigation

1024
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:41,759
and so and your expression data is that

1025
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,859
all fruit yeah so I didn't explain so

1026
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,599
the expression data that I showed was

1027
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:48,179
just from Ripe fruit collected from the

1028
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,579
field so yeah I'm just wondering do you

1029
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:53,539
do you think there was selection for

1030
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:57,480
kind of fruit specific alterations

1031
00:44:53,539 --> 00:45:00,719
these genes may be more highly expressed

1032
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,760
yeah yeah good good question so are are

1033
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,980
these genes

1034
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,460
um expressed uh elsewhere in the plant

1035
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,858
and or maybe in the hypotypes that uh

1036
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,780
that don't express these genes at all in

1037
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:16,679
the fruit yeah we've we've looked at

1038
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:19,319
that in um in public databases so it's

1039
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,059
it looks like this Locus is very food

1040
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:23,279
specific

1041
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,980
um meaning that you know especially Mass

1042
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,740
3 is just not all anywhere except for

1043
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,619
you know breaker stage and then ripe is

1044
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:33,239
very high and then mess one is expressed

1045
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:35,338
a little bit higher earlier on but it

1046
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,919
goes up

1047
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:40,078
um during ripening

1048
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,300
um yeah mass2 we have actually not found

1049
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,400
expression of that in any of the tissues

1050
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,640
in public database so I don't know what

1051
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,160
mass2 is doing mess four is also kind of

1052
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,980
Hit or Miss so I don't know we we are

1053
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:55,618
working with a group in Knoxville

1054
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,659
Tennessee uh Fang Chen and he's

1055
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,539
interested in uh

1056
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:03,179
um in methyl salicylate in root and

1057
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:06,239
leaves and so they've been quantifying

1058
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:08,460
this collection for methyl salicylate

1059
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,879
levels in the roots and uh and the

1060
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,199
leaves so once we get there

1061
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,760
you know they want to share the data

1062
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,219
with us so we can run it through the

1063
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,859
gbos pipeline and we'll see if the same

1064
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:23,098
Locus contributes to methyl salicylate

1065
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:24,739
levels in in other parts of the plant

1066
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,780
yeah

1067
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:30,358
you would be um talking to a breeder

1068
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,760
about reducing methodology levels and

1069
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,739
fruit would you rather recommend pushing

1070
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,760
the pathway upwards just towards

1071
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:41,159
salicylic acid or downwards towards the

1072
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,760
glycoside glycosylated conversions yeah

1073
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:46,259
you get their trade-off yeah so if if

1074
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,240
the plant is

1075
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,220
um uh you know methyl salicylate level

1076
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,439
still can go up in those that produce

1077
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,239
very low levels if the plant is attacked

1078
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,400
for example so there's all the

1079
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,858
mechanisms to turn to turn on the

1080
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,800
production of you know salicylic acid

1081
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:04,440
the methyl salicylate so for breeders

1082
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,400
what I would recommend functional uh at

1083
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,440
nsdt1 and a functional appropriate

1084
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,380
admissible as well

1085
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:16,019
so mess Locus is largely selected

1086
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,579
already in the germplasm but if you were

1087
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:19,679
to make crosses to you know wild

1088
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,480
relatives or so for disease resistance

1089
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,598
or other traits you want to make sure

1090
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,960
you get the right HEPA type of mess uh

1091
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,960
in there

1092
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:31,799
yeah so that's what we could tell

1093
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,420
breeders in this case so this is a

1094
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,460
little simpler story but there's still

1095
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,980
variation out there that we cannot

1096
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,019
explain so there's still more out there

1097
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,059
to be mined

1098
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:45,059
thank you everyone

1099
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,059
