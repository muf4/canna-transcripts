1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,400
University um so like Lori said um my

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,000
lab works on these thermally dimorphic

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,039
fungi so these are all pathogens of

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,640
people and unlike many fungi that cause

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,240
disease in people they're all primary

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,399
pathogens which means that they can

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:28,239
infect um healthy individuals as well as

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:30,839
imuno compromised individuals and what

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,199
Drew me to these organisms is that they

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,640
all have the very interesting capacity

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
to sense temperature and that's how they

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,079
distinguish whether they're growing in

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,959
the soil which is kind of their natural

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,640
habitat or whether they're inside a

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Maman host and on this slide you can see

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,159
um these two images so these are both um

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,960
histoplasma capsulatum so uh this is one

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,558
of the organisms that we study and when

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,640
it grows in the soil it grows in a um

21
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,000
one second I'm going to see if I can

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,280
make the pointer not go away okay so it

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,280
grows in a filamentous form so long

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,000
chains of cells or hyy um for those

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,040
familiar with the fungal lexicon and

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,118
this form also produces vegetative

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,079
spores and so then when the soil is

28
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,319
disrupted fragments of these filaments

29
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,519
um and the spores get aerosolized and

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,798
they can get inhaled by mammals

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,319
including humans um and then inside the

32
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,720
host these cells will transition to a

33
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,478
budding yeast form so a more unicellular

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,640
form of growth and um that form in the

35
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,478
case of histoplasma goes on to colonize

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,920
inate immune cells so specifically

37
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,118
macrofagos um and so in my lab we study

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,759
um so since temperature is a major

39
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:51,280
signal that triggers this switch between

40
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,079
the soil form and the host form we study

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,239
how the cells sense temperature um and

42
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,959
then and that's something we can we can

43
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,879
recapitulate this transition in the

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,919
laboratory simply by switching the temp

45
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,158
tempure so that makes it um a little bit

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,599
uh easier to study alth the although

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,640
these are uh somewhat challenging

48
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,200
organisms um but then we also look at in

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,479
addition to temperature sensing we look

50
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,598
at the interaction between uh these

51
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,878
fungi um and innate immune cells and

52
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:24,238
today I'm going to focus mostly on the

53
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,919
um temperature regulation of morphology

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,319
um but I will tell you a little bit

55
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,878
about um veillance as well all right so

56
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,238
these are the these are the main

57
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,120
organisms the thermally dimorphic fungi

58
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,000
that are primary pathogens so

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,759
histoplasma is up there at the top um

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,039
and uh I'm going to tell you today some

61
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:48,280
histoplasma biology and then also covid

62
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:52,158
coides um the third one down um which is

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,878
uh one of the sorry um which is one of

64
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,519
the thermal dimorphs that we more

65
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,840
recently started studying so when we

66
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,280
embarked on this field for all of these

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,319
organisms it was clear clear that they

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,878
sense temperature and that that affects

69
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,318
their development either in the soil

70
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:09,199
form on the left or the host form on the

71
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,039
right um but for none of them did we

72
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,679
understand what the pathways are that

73
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,598
allow the cells to sense temperature and

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,840
then um adopt the appropriate um

75
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:21,759
morphology um and I'll just tell you

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,799
within the the US these are the areas

77
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,840
where these fungi are endemic so

78
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,719
histoplasma is mostly in the Ohio and

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Mississippi river valleys down into

80
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:36,639
Texas and coides is a uh Southwestern us

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,039
pathogen so um uh California Arizona um

82
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,679
it's spreading northwards into Oregon

83
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,639
and Washington State and then it's also

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,159
um Mexico Central America South

85
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,759
America

86
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:52,438
okay so um I really love this slide

87
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,239
because it's um it's an old one but it

88
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:56,959
kind of encapsulates um some of this

89
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,400
really interesting temperature dependent

90
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,759
biology so um on the top you can see uh

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,920
what happens to histoplasma spores at

92
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:09,399
37° so here we're starting with um

93
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,000
asexual spores that histoplasma has

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,719
generated that we've generated in the

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,438
lab then we're allowing them to

96
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,238
germinate at two different temperatures

97
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,478
so along the top you can see that if you

98
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,599
germinate them at poost temperature or

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,240
37 degrees Celsius they'll um happily

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,879
divide uh in the yeast form so they'll

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,600
generate these unicellular yeast cells

102
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,159
but if you germinate them at lower

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,639
temperatures they'll make hyi and so we

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,680
think that there must be some molecule

105
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,280
or set of molecules in the Spore that as

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,519
it germinates allow it to sense what

107
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,758
temperature it's at and then allow it to

108
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,639
figure out whether to grow as generate

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
cells that grow as yeast or grow as hyy

110
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,879
um and then these yeast cells when

111
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,000
they're generated in the host they are a

112
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:58,839
pathogen of um macras so this is just

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,160
this is a movie um of histoplasma yeast

114
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:04,079
cells that are growing inside bone

115
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,160
marrow derived macras so um what's

116
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,000
happening is that and I know it's maybe

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,960
it's easier to see um over there um

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,959
because of the lighting um but the

119
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,359
histoplasma cells are producing a

120
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,719
secreted M Cherry protein and so when

121
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,919
the histoplasma gets phagocytosed by the

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
maccrage it gets taken up it stays

123
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:26,159
within a membrane bound compartment and

124
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,198
so all of those red rings you see that's

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,280
because the histoplasma as it divides

126
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,600
the membrane also continues to surround

127
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,879
it and then the secreted M Cherry

128
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,240
protein is is kind of ringing the

129
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,879
membrane that's the host membrane that's

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,960
um around each fungal cell and so you

131
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,079
can see there's a pretty dramatic cell

132
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,318
death event so histoplasma replicates

133
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,519
within a human a human or Mouse in this

134
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,720
case immune cell the maccrage and then

135
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,439
it will trigger host cell liis and one

136
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,600
of the things we study in the lab which

137
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm not going to really talk about today

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,560
is that the fungus produces secreted

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,360
virulence factors or ectors that Transit

140
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,399
out of the out of the fungus out of the

141
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,598
phagosome into the host cytool where

142
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,959
they stimulate um host cell death

143
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,519
Pathways um and that's an area of

144
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,359
interest for

145
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,240
us okay so getting back then to the

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,400
temperature question how do cells sense

147
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,680
temperature to turn on both this change

148
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,239
in morphology and veilance factor

149
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,478
expression that's coupled with growth in

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,160
the yeast form um and so we've been

151
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,199
studying this for for a while um and

152
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,840
over the years you know just comparing

153
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,919
the soil form and the host form we see

154
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,038
that you know there are robust gene

155
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,120
expression changes so about a quarter of

156
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:44,279
the genome uh the transcriptome sorry is

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,360
remodeled um uh during this temperature

158
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,119
transition we can see that some

159
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,240
transcripts about 1% of the transcripts

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
have an alternative transcript start

161
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,840
site depending on whether the cells are

162
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,079
growing in the hyle form or the yeast

163
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,799
form and we have some evidence for

164
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,198
translational regulation again um in

165
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,598
these two different forms so temperature

166
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,319
then results in this change in cell

167
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,120
shape and gene expression and that

168
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,960
allows the fungus to be um Prime to then

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,720
colonize the host and cause

170
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:20,159
disease okay so we imagine that there

171
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,840
are some molecules in the fungus we call

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,199
them molecular thermometers just

173
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,758
borrowing a term from the field of

174
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,240
temperature sensing um in general um and

175
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,360
so we think that for example a molecular

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
thermometer is a molecule that changes

177
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,199
its confirmation in response to

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,598
temperature and that could be a protein

179
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,478
it could be an RNA um there are even

180
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,878
some examples of DNA um sensing uh

181
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,000
temperature changes changing the

182
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,080
topology of the DNA um but that that

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,158
that confirmational change which could

184
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,839
be intrinsic uh to the temperature would

185
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,319
then um prompt the cells to turn on

186
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,399
signaling Pathways that determine growth

187
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
in either the yeast or the hyle form and

188
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,198
it looks like I guess the bottom of my

189
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,479
slides are going to get cut off a little

190
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,520
bit so hopefully there's not too much

191
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,719
information that we're going to lose

192
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,719
okay so the holy grail for us has been

193
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,479
trying to identify what these

194
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,960
temperature sensors could be and I'm

195
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,478
going to tell you in this first part of

196
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,198
the talk how we are approaching um that

197
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,800
problem so a number of years ago now we

198
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,919
did a screen for uh genes that are

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,960
required for yeast phase growth so just

200
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,639
simply re reasoning there's some pathway

201
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,278
Downstream temperature that's going to

202
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,360
result in the ability for histoplasma

203
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,000
cells to grow in the yeast form and if

204
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,399
we um have mutants that are deficient in

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
that pathway we will then get meant that

206
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,200
are unable to grow as yeast and instead

207
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,519
they will be constitutively um

208
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,959
filamentous and so in that mutant screen

209
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,200
we identified a number of genes that are

210
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,639
required for yeast phase growth or we

211
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,040
call them rip um and you can see here

212
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,240
the phenotype so wild type cells will

213
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:04,078
grow in the yeast form at 37° uh the

214
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,278
filament is form at room temperature um

215
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,319
just as I've told you but these mutants

216
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:10,200
are constitutively filamentous so

217
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,839
independent of temperature they always

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,759
grow um as hyy and each of these mutants

219
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,399
turns out to be deficient in a different

220
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,838
transcription Factor so all four of

221
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,759
these transcription factors are required

222
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,399
um for yeast phase

223
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:30,000
growth and uh they are all conserved

224
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,839
fungal transcription factors and these

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,240
transcription factors are each

226
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,360
upregulated in response to 37° or high

227
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,120
temperature either at the transcript

228
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,759
level or the protein level or both and

229
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,399
each is required for the normal

230
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,200
transcriptional program which you can

231
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:51,078
see here so um while type cells uh as I

232
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,120
told you uh grow as yeast at 37 degrees

233
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm going to try the pointer here um and

234
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,519
then uh filaments at room temperature

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,720
and if you just look at this First

236
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,839
Column so here this is just a heat map

237
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,879
of transcriptional data where each row

238
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,760
is a different Gene and if you compare

239
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,720
wild type cells growing um at 37 degrees

240
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,319
to room temperature you can see that

241
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
there's a set of transcripts that's

242
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,000
normally upregulated at 37 degrees and

243
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,240
there's a set of transcripts that's

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,440
normally upregulated at room temperature

245
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,480
when the cells are growing as filaments

246
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
and then in each of these rip mutants if

247
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,000
you compare their gene expression

248
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,919
profile at 37° to while type cells

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,759
growing growing at 37° you can see that

250
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,078
they fail to upregulate that set of

251
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,360
transcripts that's normally associated

252
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:41,479
with high temperature growth and instead

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,639
they inappropriately accumulate

254
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,480
transcripts that are normally expressed

255
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,720
in the hyle form um at room temperature

256
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,480
so there each of them is a master

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,200
regulator of um yeast phase growth and

258
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,879
that program um and interestingly to us

259
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,920
when we started you know when we first

260
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,679
defined them sorry and uh we looked at

261
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,879
their transcriptional targets we could

262
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,479
see that they regulate genes that are

263
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,559
required for both cell shape as well as

264
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,839
veilance and so they were the first or

265
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,638
they are the first molecular handle

266
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,639
between temperature and these Downstream

267
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,320
phenotypes of you know changing the cell

268
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:22,680
shape and turning on bance genes um so

269
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,320
this work is all published um uh we

270
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,958
basically defined the network of these

271
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,120
rip transcription factors we can see

272
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,799
that they all regulate

273
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,839
well rip one two and four regulate them

274
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,278
regulate themselves um they all regulate

275
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,079
each other either directly as indicated

276
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,078
by the solid lines or indirectly as

277
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,319
regulated by the dash lines so I think

278
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,278
one of the reasons each of these four

279
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
transcription factors is required is

280
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,879
that when you take out any one of the

281
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,679
four you're basically taking out all

282
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:59,679
four because they regulate each other um

283
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:03,039
we defined a motif uh for rip one um

284
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:06,120
that we call um here Motif a and we and

285
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,199
we just we biochemically found the rip

286
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,360
two and rip three which are part of the

287
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:15,199
same um transcription Factor family um

288
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,159
make a heterodimer and together bind a

289
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:21,000
separate Motif Motif B and then in terms

290
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:24,480
of the genes that are required for cells

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,078
to become a yeast cell so yeast phase

292
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,360
specific genes or yps genes there are

293
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,759
all kinds of combinations of different

294
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,879
motifs um that stimulate the expression

295
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,198
of those genes in response to

296
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:40,000
temperature so having defined these

297
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:43,039
networks um what was really useful for

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,720
us was that some of the downstream genes

299
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,360
were important candidates for virence

300
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,160
these are all you know sort of effectors

301
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,000
of unknown function and we've been

302
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,838
exploring that but what I'm going to

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,120
focus on more today is this question of

304
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,199
what turns on this pathway in response

305
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,919
to temperature thinking up stre of the

306
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:07,559
rip genes and um how that might work so

307
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,799
um just to then quickly summarize that

308
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,000
and set up the the next question so I've

309
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,278
told you that these four transcription

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,958
factors form a complex circuit they

311
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:17,799
regulate each other they regulate

312
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,919
themselves and they're required for the

313
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,599
normal morphologic response and

314
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,078
molecular response to temperature but

315
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,480
we'd like to understand then what is it

316
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,078
about the higher temperature that

317
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,920
regulates um these important

318
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,239
transcription factors

319
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,759
um and so to set that up I'll just tell

320
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,879
you uh one of the things we've looked at

321
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:43,000
in the past is um comparing um steady

322
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:45,480
state um yeast cells grown at 37 degrees

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,039
to steady state hyy I didn't tell you

324
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,399
this but it it actually this is not a

325
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,480
fast transition for these cells

326
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,559
morphologically they're slow growing

327
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,000
cells it actually takes if you start out

328
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,599
with yeast cells growing at 37 degrees

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,480
and you shift the temperature down to

330
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,519
room temp temperature it takes several

331
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,440
days to make highi um so if you look at

332
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,278
the steady state populations and you

333
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,680
look by Western at the rip proteins what

334
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,519
you see is that the rip proteins are

335
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,399
much more highly they accumulate to much

336
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,480
higher levels in um steady state yeast

337
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,879
as opposed to hyy so they're just not

338
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,199
around in steady state hyy at Rim

339
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,039
temperature to very high levels um and

340
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,399
interestingly one of the things that we

341
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,399
continue to explore is that the

342
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,679
translational efficiency of the rip 1

343
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,399
and two transcripts seems to be

344
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,039
temperature responsive so it seems like

345
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,879
at 37 degrees you facilitate the

346
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:49,480
translation of rip one transcript and at

347
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:51,519
Rim temperature you you um you uh

348
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,079
whatever the opposite of facilitate is

349
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,000
the you sort of downregulate the ability

350
00:14:54,078 --> 00:15:00,078
of that rip 2 transcript to be made to

351
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,399
be translated at um rim temperature and

352
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,198
so that's a very interesting um area of

353
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,519
potential temperature regulation that

354
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,519
we're investigating I I also told you

355
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,480
that there's differential transcript

356
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,959
start sites for some um subset of

357
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,800
transcripts including rip 2 actually at

358
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,679
the two temperatures um and now one

359
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,799
thing that uh morat um oh you can't see

360
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,879
his name at the bottom of the slide that

361
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,879
um Marat uh a post talk in the lab

362
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:33,159
is exploring is just looking globally

363
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,759
um in genome wide at RNA shape at the

364
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,600
two temperatures and so this is

365
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,879
something we are continuing to

366
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,240
investigate how different RNA molecules

367
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:45,278
might serve as molecular

368
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,399
thermosensors but um the next so that's

369
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,198
all well and good but the next set of

370
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,198
experiments I want to tell you is based

371
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,799
on the reasoning that if there's

372
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:57,399
something intrinsic about temperature

373
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,399
that is um that is causing a change in

374
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,559
the cells then we ought to be able to

375
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,799
see that not just by looking at these

376
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,599
steady state very different cells yeast

377
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,479
and hyy but after acute temperature

378
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,920
shift if it's intrinsic then it

379
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:16,039
shouldn't take days to um to cause a

380
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:18,799
change and so we wanted to understand

381
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,480
two things one is what happens at

382
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,159
intermediate temperatures and this has

383
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,839
never been looked at in the literature

384
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,919
and then what happens short term after

385
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,839
you change the temperature from

386
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,559
37° so um and I'll just say one of the

387
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,000
reasons this very simple question of

388
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,838
what happens at intermediate

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,879
temperatures hasn't been looked at is

390
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,959
because these organisms require

391
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,399
biosafety level three containment to

392
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:45,758
work on because they can infect healthy

393
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,639
people in the lab and so um that means

394
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,318
that a lot of the fundamentals um we we

395
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,039
don't understand um and so uh this is

396
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:57,078
one of one example of that so we wanted

397
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,838
to understand whether 37 degree that

398
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,000
temperature was required to m maintain

399
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,199
um rip transcription Factor activ

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,959
activity and if you shift the

401
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:11,038
temperature down acutely uh what happens

402
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,519
um and so we so Anna Morrison who's a

403
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,919
current graduate student in the lab

404
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,160
finishing up her PhD um looked at what

405
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
happens early on when you shift um the

406
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,558
temperature down both to room

407
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,319
temperature and some of these

408
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,838
intermediate temperatures so first

409
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,678
morphologically um so starting out with

410
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,599
yeast cells at Day Zero

411
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,960
um Anna maintain them at 37 degrees and

412
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,959
then you maintain the yeast morphology

413
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
as you would expect but if you shift

414
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,440
them to room temperature then you start

415
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,279
to generate High full cells um and then

416
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,160
at intermediate temperatures it turns

417
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,720
out that you don't maintain the yeast

418
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,160
form at 29 degrees Celsius or even at 33

419
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,960
degrees Celsius a four a 4 degree

420
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,880
temperature shift down from

421
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:03,079
37 um and so uh we need maintenance at

422
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,559
37 Dees to keep um uh the yeast form and

423
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:09,279
so Anna wanted to look at what happened

424
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:12,918
um transcriptionally to cells um and she

425
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,678
decided to look um two hours after the

426
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,200
temperature shift so I'll just remind

427
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:20,000
you at two hours after the temperature

428
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,038
shift all the cells look morphologically

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,200
like yeast it takes a number of days for

430
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,000
them to shift into the hyle form but

431
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,000
even though they look morphologically

432
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
like yeast the question was what are

433
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,038
they doing transcriptionally after this

434
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,919
2hour shift and it turns out uh to be

435
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:40,158
the case that about a quarter of the

436
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:43,080
transcriptome changes significantly in

437
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:47,200
expression level after a 2hour shift to

438
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:50,359
lower temperatures um and you can see uh

439
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,159
what I'm showing you uh in terms of what

440
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:56,000
the yellow indicates so these different

441
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:58,440
columns are um what happens when you uh

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,960
compare the um gene expression profile

443
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,840
of cells grown at 37° with a 2hour shift

444
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,200
to a lower temperature either 33 29 or

445
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,879
room temperature so the yellow these are

446
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,200
the genes that are normally um expressed

447
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,799
in the yeast form at 37 degrees but

448
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,720
change in expression when you shift um

449
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:20,480
when you shift the cells down and the

450
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,600
blue are the ones that are normally hyul

451
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,159
in their expression um and they turn on

452
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,158
when you shift the cells from 37 degrees

453
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,320
to a lower temperature and so just

454
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,000
looking at these genes so so um this was

455
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,359
this was very interesting because it

456
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,119
told us okay even at an early stage when

457
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,839
the cells still look morphologically

458
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,599
like yeast transcriptionally they're

459
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,079
very different and the cells already

460
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,678
know they're no longer maintained at 37

461
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,199
degrees and so um some of these genes

462
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,200
make sense to us so for example and this

463
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,319
will be uh relevant in a few slides

464
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,120
hsp90 which is a well-known heat shock

465
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:02,678
protein chaperone um in UK carotic cells

466
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,158
so hsp90 is one of the genes that when

467
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,759
you when you shift the cells down from

468
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,679
37 degrees they start to turn off hsp90

469
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,679
expression and I'll just say here that

470
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,080
you know that's sort of very appealing

471
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,640
because the heat shock pathway you know

472
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,119
if you just think about the question of

473
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,480
how do cells sense temperature you know

474
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:26,279
heat shock response is a highly

475
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,440
conserved um response from you know you

476
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:33,558
know across you know different King

477
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,440
and so um it it's it's appealing to tie

478
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:39,279
in the heat shock response to um how

479
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,558
these organisms sense temperature and so

480
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,918
um this kind of goes along with old data

481
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:47,319
in the lab where Cam ban a former postto

482
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,559
um showed that if you take yeast cells

483
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:53,839
grown at 37 degrees and you treat them

484
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,240
with a chemical inhibitor of hsp70 you

485
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,480
see filamentation of the cells telling

486
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,679
us that the a sorry I said HSP p70 I me

487
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,720
hsp90 so the that hsp90 pathway is

488
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,720
required for yeast phase growth and the

489
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,200
cells will turn down expression of H

490
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,558
hsp90 when you shift um them below 37

491
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,880
degrees similarly some of the other

492
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:20,960
genes um in this cluster um include

493
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,200
other transcription factors that we know

494
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,919
contribute to morphology because if in

495
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,679
this case cph1 if we knock it down the

496
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,400
cells can't maintain yeast phase

497
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,240
morphology

498
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,440
um and additionally some of the

499
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,640
veillance factors that are required for

500
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,798
yeast phase biology are also regulated

501
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,520
acutely by temperature so this um

502
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:46,319
affector in histoplasma is required for

503
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:49,200
maccrage Lis so I showed you that movie

504
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:52,359
early on of histoplasma yeast cells

505
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,400
licing host macras and you can see here

506
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,319
that wild type cells um wild type

507
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,120
histoplasma cells if you infect

508
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:03,240
macrofagos they'll trigger hostel Lis

509
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:06,278
which we can measure by release of a um

510
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,519
a maccrage molecule into the supernat

511
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:10,839
lactate dehydrogenase if you don't

512
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,079
infect the macrofagos you don't see Lis

513
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,759
and if you mutate the sperance factor

514
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:19,359
you also don't see Lis so again these um

515
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,960
effectors their expression is exquisitly

516
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,959
tied to growth at 37

517
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,960
degrees okay and similarly some of the

518
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,840
genes that um turn on when you shift the

519
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:35,960
cells down down from 37° include um

520
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:38,959
genes that we've shown are um sufficient

521
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,038
to trigger filamentation of cells if we

522
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,159
inappropriately Express them at 37

523
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:47,000
degrees so these temperature dependent

524
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:49,440
regulons um make sense to us so just

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,359
thinking about then what I've told you

526
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,759
um we know that transitioning

527
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,038
histoplasma from 37 degrees to lower

528
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,960
temperatures is sufficient to disrupt

529
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,278
yeast phase growth and transcriptional

530
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,079
changes occur very fast after transition

531
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:06,000
to lower temperatures um probably uh

532
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,079
within 30 minutes to an hour though I've

533
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,038
shown you the data for um two hours

534
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:14,519
after the transition um and just notably

535
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,400
for the next part of the talk these heat

536
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,359
chock pathway genes are some of the

537
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,038
genes that are very sensitive to Temp

538
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,000
the temperature of the environment so I

539
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,119
showed you a western blot of ripped

540
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,119
protein levels in steady state East and

541
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,678
hyy and I told you that there aren't um

542
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,918
there isn't much rip protein around at

543
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,080
room temperature in steady state growth

544
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,000
but how about two hours or a day after

545
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,599
the shift well it turns out that rip

546
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,278
protein levels are rip proteins are

547
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:46,678
still quite abundant these transcription

548
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:49,960
factors um when you shift um down from

549
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,320
37 degrees at these short time points so

550
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,038
this change in transcription suggests

551
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,000
that even though the proteins are there

552
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:58,519
something is happening about their

553
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,119
activity um when you shift down from 30

554
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:05,240
7° so um Anna did some uh chromatin IP

555
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,918
experiments where she's essentially

556
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,599
imuno precipitating um the DNA targets

557
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,679
that are bound by the rip proteins

558
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,879
either at 37 degrees or two hours after

559
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,640
shift um concomitant with also probing

560
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,200
the transcriptome by RNA seek and I'm

561
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,880
not going to show you all the data but

562
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,038
what she's observed is that many um

563
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,520
chromatin IP events or Association

564
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,000
events of these rip transcriptions

565
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:35,639
factors are 37 degre at 37 degrees are

566
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,880
reduced or absent after shift to 25

567
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,480
degrees so this is telling us that rip

568
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,760
activity is actually regulated by

569
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,679
temperature not just rip abundance and

570
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,359
in that data which we're still analyzing

571
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,120
Anna found a really interesting heat

572
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:56,079
shock pathway signature so I had told

573
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,798
you before that um normally rip one uh

574
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,879
from our previous published data

575
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:02,519
associated with a particular

576
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,320
Motif um and then rip two and three form

577
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:08,119
a heterodimer and associate with the DNA

578
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,439
at a different Motif so from these data

579
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:13,678
what what Anna found was the surprising

580
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,720
result that rip two um shown here in

581
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,080
green so this is Rip 2 chromatin IP at

582
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,640
37 degrees in in green versus two hours

583
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,199
after a shift down to 25 degrees in

584
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,080
Black that there were a set of

585
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,080
associations for rip 2 that were

586
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:32,319
actually not at its Norm normal DNA

587
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:35,960
binding Motif but instead we're at hses

588
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:39,439
or heat shock Elements which are um

589
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,360
which are the DNA binding um motifs that

590
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,919
regulate expression of the heat shock

591
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:48,599
pathway so um we were able to discover

592
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,640
that at 37 degrees rip 2 is associating

593
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,158
at this different Motif a heat shock

594
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,559
element and that that is dependent on on

595
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,559
temperature um and so
