1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,350
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,349
University

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,390
my lab works on DNA methylation and

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:19,599
epigenetic inheritance and well I'll

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,160
tell you about today is a problem we've

6
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:26,140
been working on for a few years which is

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:29,410
how do a plant and other eukaryotes

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:38,170
actually manage to inherit patterns of

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:40,149
DNA methylation on chromatin so how does

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,760
efficient inheritance work around this

11
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:46,179
the structure where DNA is ramped around

12
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,399
around histones so I'll start the talk

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,198
by introducing DNA methylation and

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,899
epigenetic inheritance and then I'll

15
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,549
tell you about our work in the trying to

16
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,039
understand how this deals with with

17
00:00:54,549 --> 00:01:01,088
comment in and then I'll finish up with

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:05,829
with some evolutionary implications of

19
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:10,539
for our work so first just to introduce

20
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:13,509
epigenetic inheritance and and how DNA

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,520
methylation plays around us so this is

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:21,250
nicely illustrated by the synopsis gene

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:25,329
called FWA and this gene is normally

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,969
silenced in in Arabidopsis plants in

25
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:32,140
vegetative tissues and it's silenced by

26
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:34,450
DNA methylation that is present on the

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,000
promoter and the start of transcription

28
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:42,400
of this gene and now about 25 years ago

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,079
Martin Clunes lab isolated a semi

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,630
dominant late flowering mutants that

31
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,009
they called FWA and when they tried to

32
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:54,299
figure out what was causing this they

33
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:59,920
found this gene that was over expressed

34
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:01,750
in in in the leaves of these mutants but

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,120
there were no genetic differences

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,189
between this FWA and this sub waa and

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,909
the reason for the phenotype is that

38
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:12,039
this FWA version is not methylated so

39
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:13,159
these plants are genetically identical

40
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:17,810
they don't

41
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:19,729
don't have any and a DNA sequence

42
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,039
differences the only difference is that

43
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:25,909
here the stain is methylated and here is

44
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,889
not methylated and these two methyl

45
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:32,090
states are these two states very stable

46
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:34,099
in the laboratory at least these plants

47
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,140
will always be early flowering and this

48
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,810
genes always be methylated in silence

49
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:40,039
this genes will be always late flowering

50
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,349
and this gene will always be a

51
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,639
methylated AM and active and in fact

52
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,039
they're stable enough that you can cross

53
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,819
them together so you can put and cross

54
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,019
these plans with these plants and these

55
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,989
methylated are methylated alleles will

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,540
stay methylated and are methylated than

57
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,090
they have to they'll segregate as

58
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:02,179
Mendelian illegals and so this behaves

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,349
as a perfectly normal Mendelian Indian

60
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,629
trade and this isn't just a property

61
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:12,009
that occurs in the laboratory so we

62
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:15,919
round the same time Rikka corn slab of

63
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:20,030
described a epigenetic allele in

64
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:25,479
toadflax the toad facts normally has

65
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:30,099
bilaterally symmetric flowers but a wild

66
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:33,259
normally occurring version of these

67
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,389
species has these so-called polar

68
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,379
explorers which have radial symmetry and

69
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,329
very different arrangements of the

70
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,310
flowers and this is caused by

71
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,910
methylation and silencing of the cyclo

72
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,490
dia transcription factor and this allele

73
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,199
justice was actually described as far

74
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:54,080
singer for the first time by Linnaeus in

75
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:56,119
1753 old illegal and it's been around

76
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,300
for at least 150 years in natural

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,319
populations of toadflax so these

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,180
methylated and unmethylated states

79
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,530
candidates should be quite quite stable

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,510
and persistent

81
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,520
but this this ability of DNA methylation

82
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,199
to do carry epigenetic information has

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,330
to do with how it's initiated and

84
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,620
maintain them what I'll tell you today

85
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,699
is fairly specific for for plants but it

86
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,290
works in a similar way in animals too so

87
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,089
in this is the the really the plant

88
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,180
specific part where in plants DNA

89
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,769
methylation is initiated by this pathway

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,199
called RNA directed DNA methylation

91
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,769
which is a derivative of RNA

92
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,539
interference this is very simplified

93
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:40,589
very very simplified version of how this

94
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,060
works so a transcript is made that is

95
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,709
recognized as aberrant in some way

96
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,389
perhaps is double-stranded have there

97
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:48,359
there are other issues with this and

98
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:51,329
then it is converted upon conscription

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,009
and this transcription occurs by pol ii

100
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,740
but it also occurs by a plant specific

101
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,870
version of polymerase to go pol for and

102
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,060
it's converted by an RNA dependent RNA

103
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,360
polymerase called our tier 2 into double

104
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,480
stranded version that is then processed

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,680
by a Dicer nucleus into small rnas the

106
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,509
smaller is get loaded into a effective

107
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,780
complex that contains an organelle

108
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:18,180
protein and this appears to interact

109
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,819
with a nascent RNA made by another

110
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,220
derivative of pol ii called pol v

111
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,990
that has an accessory nucleosome

112
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,120
remodeling protein called dirty one and

113
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,079
we'll talk about remodeling proteins

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,000
more than a second and this interaction

115
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,439
somehow activates a DNA

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,069
methyltransferase which in Arabidopsis

117
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,469
is called drm to that methylates the DNA

118
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,029
and it suppresses transcription from

119
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:49,630
from the slogans

120
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:52,629
now the DRM methyltransferases and their

121
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:56,329
animal homologs called e93

122
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:58,370
they can't fix of some extent methylated

123
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,899
cytosines in any sequence context so all

124
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,550
the methylation I'll talk about today is

125
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,649
methylation of cytosine sin the sister

126
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,980
the the predominant form of DNA

127
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,829
methylation in in eukaryotes but if in

128
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,110
plants if the RNA signals turned off

129
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:15,169
then this methylation would disappear

130
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,639
because the after DNA replication the

131
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,790
old strand here in black keeps its

132
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,159
methylation but the new strand in red is

133
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,310
synthesized unmethylated there's another

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,439
methyl transferase system that is there

135
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,230
to keep the methylation propagated

136
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,199
across generations and this is a methyl

137
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,800
transfer is called met wan in plants and

138
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,170
dnmt1 in in animals and what it does is

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,680
with at least one accessory protein it

140
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,689
recognizes cg the nucleotides that are

141
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,400
methylated in one strand but not on the

142
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,490
other and then it methylates the

143
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:54,819
unmethylated cytosine and because these

144
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:56,540
sites are symmetrical this catalysis

145
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:58,879
essentially allows semiconservative

146
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,000
inheritance of DNA methylation patterns

147
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,069
everytime the DNA is replicated and this

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,199
this is the core catalytic process that

149
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,779
as far as we know makes DNA methylation

150
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,949
epigenetic so this allows for the

151
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,509
methylation patterns to go through

152
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:14,680
mitosis and at least some plans to go

153
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,680
through meiosis very effective

154
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:25,039
so in implants there's another yet

155
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:32,139
another pathway for DNA methylation that

156
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,139
I need to introduce so the

157
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:41,560
I'll go on I think I hope I didn't make

158
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,849
a mistake I might have copper copied

159
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,230
their own version of my talk into this

160
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:50,830
computer we'll see if if I did we might

161
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:54,160
have need to do a little switch so yes

162
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:56,289
sir because a third of the talk this

163
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,939
slide was meant to come first so I'll

164
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,230
just go back right so for so if I just

165
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,930
first want to tell you about the

166
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,060
function of DNA methylation in implants

167
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,230
and the major function appears to be the

168
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,939
silenced trance possible elements so the

169
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,470
basic idea is the transposons will be

170
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:18,430
methylated and this methylation will be

171
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:23,530
heritable in her to be maintained and it

172
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:26,560
will silence these transposons and this

173
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:30,309
will preserve the integrity of the

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,229
genome and then gene regulation of kinda

175
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,809
showed you will FWA will happen when a

176
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,190
transposon will insert in the vicinity

177
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,689
of a gene and this will become

178
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:43,719
methylated and then this has the

179
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:46,630
potential to silence the gene so there's

180
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,760
also a type of DNA methylation in in

181
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,200
plants and many animals which is present

182
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,419
with inactive genes but we won't really

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,620
talk about that today the entire talk

184
00:08:52,419 --> 00:09:03,250
will be focused on transposon

185
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:05,500
methylation and in plants particularly

186
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,440
in transposons there's another DNA

187
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,129
methylation system so in addition to the

188
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,560
93 MD 91 their chroma methylases and

189
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:15,850
these are methyl transferases and the

190
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,879
one that are in their evidence is called

191
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,190
CMT 3 and that methylates a context

192
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,200
called c h g so it's called those

193
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,010
because H stands for anything but gene

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,900
and it's just down to two separate this

195
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:32,710
context from the one catalyzed by map

196
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:34,509
one and these these methyl transferases

197
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:39,610
are

198
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:42,319
linked to a histone modification called

199
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,759
HT k 9m e 2 which is the die methylation

200
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,900
of lysine 9 of histone h3 into all kinds

201
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,330
of DNA methylation all these three

202
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,970
pathways convergent transposons and

203
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,740
because these DRMs are not very sequence

204
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,019
specific their methylation is generally

205
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,539
referred to CH h see anything but G

206
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:01,639
anything but G so separated from the

207
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:09,139
kinds catalyzed I'm at one the kind is

208
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:10,580
catalyzed by CMT 3 I'm apologize for the

209
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,019
full of slides mix-up so the one thing I

210
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:17,000
wanted one final thing I wanted to

211
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:18,980
mention is that fro it's well known and

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,899
plans for quite a few years stuff pretty

213
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,539
much all the cg methylation is catalyzed

214
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,039
by this enzyme at one and all the CH d

215
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:30,829
methylation is catalyzed by this enzyme

216
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:34,759
CMT 3 but the not all the CH h

217
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:37,040
methylation is catalyzed by the drm so

218
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,539
there was something else missing from

219
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:43,029
from this picture that was mediating

220
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:43,029
some of this asymmetric CH h methylation

221
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,850
okay

222
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,980
so now that I've introduced DNA

223
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,659
methylation and epigenetic inheritance

224
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,389
kind of get to the heart of the talk

225
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,169
which is how this actually works within

226
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,879
chromatin

227
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:03,389
all right so everything I showed you so

228
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,278
far is methyl transferases methylating

229
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:09,889
DNA but this DNA is wrapped around

230
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:12,240
around the nucleus ohm and the this

231
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:14,519
imposes certain limitations on DNA

232
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,698
methylation and these limitations I

233
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:21,899
think became kind of clear quite a while

234
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:25,049
ago when Eric Richards discovered this

235
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,839
gene called em1 and the game long came

236
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:30,649
out of a genetic screen for mittens with

237
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,569
large losses of DNA methylation and

238
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,370
didn't want turned out to be a type of

239
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:38,969
protein called a nucleus or remodeler

240
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,850
that is basically a ATPase driven ATP

241
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:45,079
driven machine that does work on

242
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:48,420
nucleosomes so these are proteins that

243
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:50,370
can assemble nuclear films they can move

244
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,769
nucleosomes they can space out nuclear

245
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,389
films they can disassemble nucleosomes

246
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,720
they can take out a part of when you

247
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,100
could assume and put another party yeah

248
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:07,649
so they're kind of these work engines

249
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:09,839
that that's worked with chromatin and so

250
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,318
the identification of this gene made it

251
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:17,250
clear that the the nucleosomes and

252
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:21,838
chromatin had an important influence on

253
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:24,299
DNA methylation and later people figured

254
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,949
out the DNA dm1 loss of function causes

255
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,049
major methylation losses in all sequence

256
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:30,448
contacts so it affects CGC HD and

257
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:32,609
situation methylation it is required for

258
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:34,318
methylation in transposons but not in

259
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,139
genes so this gene methylation I

260
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:38,599
mentioned is not affected really by TM

261
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:42,830
one

262
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,560
it has a close homolog and mount mammals

263
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:50,150
called LSH that appears do more less the

264
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:52,399
same thing but how did he mom actually

265
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:54,319
interfaced with DNA methyltransferase

266
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,899
systems including RNA directed intimate

267
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,030
relations really unclear how it actually

268
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:03,139
was mediating methylation and all all

269
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:06,769
the different sequence contacts so

270
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:10,279
initially we approach this by analyzing

271
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:12,230
DNA methylation genome-wide in DMR

272
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,269
mutants and and Wheaton's that affected

273
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,909
this our lead directly DNA methylation

274
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:20,049
and the two meetings we worked with the

275
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:22,850
most as our dr to this mutant in this

276
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,669
RNA dependent RNA polymerase in dr d1

277
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,690
this nucleus m remodeler which is

278
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:28,639
specifically seems to be required for

279
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,510
RNA directed DNA methylation so it's a

280
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,649
protein district homologous to DM 1 and

281
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:35,569
i will be showing you quite a lot of

282
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,329
these these plots these are meta

283
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,980
analyses that show an averaging of all

284
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,330
the DNA methylation of a particular kind

285
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,039
of sequence this guy this case

286
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,600
transposon so I'll always be showing in

287
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,309
transposon and transposons are aligned

288
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,110
at the 5 prime end in the 3 prime end

289
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,929
and then the methylation across all

290
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,490
transposons averaged in both directions

291
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:59,439
so we're getting an average amount of

292
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:02,470
DNA methylation for cg e CH d and c HH

293
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,210
mm-hmm in wild i've been read

294
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,980
methylation is how for cg mutating our

295
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,850
DDM doesn't have much of an effect on

296
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,310
this d DM 1 has a very strong effect on

297
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:16,159
cg methylation and double meetings

298
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:19,759
between d DM 1 and RNA dependent RNA

299
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,159
polymerase sorry or this dr d 1 so

300
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,259
double mutants in d DM 1 and are neither

301
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,469
after DNA methylation are a little bit

302
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:28,730
stronger but just just a little bit but

303
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,870
there's really very little methylation

304
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,789
left in d DM one already for CHD

305
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,769
methylation the situation is a bit in

306
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,539
between

307
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:40,149
the our DDM mittens have a bit of a

308
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:41,799
stronger effect the game one has

309
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,999
intermediate level so methylation and

310
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:47,498
the double mutants have very low levels

311
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:51,610
and force ehh it's even more dramatic

312
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:53,409
where our DDM meetings or DD m1 have

313
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,480
these intermediate effects and almost

314
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:58,629
all the population is gone and in one

315
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,079
our DDM doubles so kind of the bottom

316
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:03,759
line here is that DTM on an hourly

317
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,349
direct DNA methylation our complimentary

318
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,509
methylation systems and if you get rid

319
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,040
of both of them you basically get rid of

320
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:13,239
almost all the transposon methylation

321
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,889
and ever the abscess genome and so the

322
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:17,439
next thing which we try to do is to link

323
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:20,259
link the this phenomenon to the metal

324
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:23,139
transferases that we're doing it and so

325
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:25,298
the first two two parts here are just

326
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:27,399
what we already knew for cg methylation

327
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:31,298
if we mediate met one there's almost

328
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,889
nothing well for CHD methylation if we

329
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:36,220
meet with a 73 there's almost nothing

330
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:38,829
left and a homologous mp3 called cmp 2

331
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:43,420
has a very small effect on this kind of

332
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:46,808
methylation but when we look at CH h

333
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:48,278
methylation we find that in drm to

334
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:51,100
eden's so these are the this is the

335
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,899
methyl transferase link to our DDM we

336
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,909
have a a partial loss of methylation

337
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,730
which looks exactly the same as the loss

338
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:59,828
of methylation in our DDM meetings but

339
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,329
in the CMT to methyl transferase there's

340
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,128
chroma methylase that is homologous to

341
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,198
see mp3 there's a very strong loss of

342
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,209
methylation and between these two they

343
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,998
account for all the non SI g methylation

344
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:12,099
all the CH h methylation in in the

345
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:15,999
genome so cmgc if you do was this

346
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,480
missing missing missing bits that was

347
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:23,170
responsible for 14 em inflation and

348
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,120
however the opposite and I think you

349
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:32,259
probably are noticing that the shapes of

350
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:33,669
these lines are different and they the

351
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,710
meetings that belong to the same pathway

352
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:38,490
resemble each other said so our DDM

353
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:43,720
meetings have this kind of bell-shaped

354
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:45,430
shape and DDM one meetings or CMT two

355
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,310
meetings they have this smiley face

356
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:49,719
shape and this is actually quite

357
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:54,519
informative about what what they're

358
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:57,460
doing this is just a zoom in on the CH h

359
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,960
methylation plants so what we're doing

360
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,650
here is we're lighting transpose ons

361
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,259
from either edges and then we're going

362
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:10,029
into the middle so close to the points

363
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:12,879
of alignment the methylation average is

364
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,740
is a small transpose ounce or the edges

365
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,890
of longer transpose if we move in

366
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,299
further and further in we're getting

367
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,540
methylation from bigger and bigger

368
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:24,849
elements right so by the time we're in

369
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:27,369
here it's 4k via 4k bien

370
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:31,569
all right so only large elements will be

371
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:32,949
averaged here and so these these

372
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:34,389
different shapes actually tell you about

373
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,319
the kinds of transposons that are being

374
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,960
methylated so in our DDM mutants it's

375
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,909
the smaller transposons that are here

376
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,029
the edges that are losing methylation

377
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,950
and then CMT two and in DDM one it's

378
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:50,680
mostly the larger transposons are here

379
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:54,549
here in the middle and this is a more

380
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,430
formal analysis of this where here we

381
00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,700
are averaging methylation with respect

382
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,960
to the size of off transposons and in

383
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,590
while table there's not much of a

384
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,299
relationship

385
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:10,109
mm-hmm but in DM 1 and in CMT to the

386
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:11,690
bigger transpose on the bigger gloss of

387
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:17,899
DNA methylation

388
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:20,660
and for our DM for DRM - or for DRD one

389
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,450
the big religions falls on the smaller

390
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,790
gloss in the DNA methylation different

391
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,009
sizes of transportable elements are

392
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:31,509
relying more on different systems our

393
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:35,359
DDM is more for for smaller elements and

394
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:37,720
DM 1 and C 2 for this kind of

395
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,459
methylation are more for larger element

396
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,860
which which is interesting but it's not

397
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,740
terribly satisfying why why how why does

398
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,719
the transposon size matter and actually

399
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,069
what matters isn't the size it met what

400
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,680
matters is the type of chromatin these

401
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,700
transposons

402
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,990
it just so happens the smaller

403
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,970
transposons in there Abba dabbas are

404
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,440
morally chromatic and bigger transposon

405
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,539
some more heterochromatic and that's

406
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,509
actually what makes the difference so

407
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:05,509
this I'll show you that that that just

408
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,829
just in the bid this is just - we have

409
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:09,109
to help you visualize what's what's

410
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:10,909
going on is a particular example so this

411
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,109
would be a short transpose and in there

412
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,860
of analysis will be a long one

413
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:18,859
and the system escalation in wild type

414
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:22,250
and for the short runs falls on in gr d1

415
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:25,759
and DRAM on the inflation is gone but in

416
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:29,119
DD m1 the CMT - is still there for the

417
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,940
long turns ball down in gr d1 and DRM to

418
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,259
the methylation is mostly there except

419
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,049
right great at the edges of the

420
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:40,789
transpose and for DD m 1 and CP 2 it's

421
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:43,879
the opposite is the methylation at the

422
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:46,639
edges that are still there but the the

423
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,860
middle is is gone and in the double

424
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,270
meetings all the methylation basically

425
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:51,399
Scott

426
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:54,069
and this these remnants of methylation

427
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,550
here correlate with the smaller names so

428
00:19:54,069 --> 00:20:00,849
this deer this pathway is driven by

429
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,980
small RNAs and so in the absence of DDM

430
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:05,230
one and TMP to the little bits of

431
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:11,140
remaining methylation are catalyzed by

432
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:13,259
our DDM through the smaller renée's so

433
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,150
this is now an analysis that looks

434
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:18,069
explicitly at this question of of

435
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,509
chromatin and so for this we're

436
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,279
confining ourselves for smaller

437
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,369
transposon transposons which are lower

438
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:28,779
smaller than 500 base pairs so that size

439
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:30,489
variation is not not an issue and we're

440
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,789
just here calculating correlation

441
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,839
coefficients so each of these bar bar

442
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:37,450
shows the correlation coefficient

443
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,669
between the loss of DNA methylation in

444
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:44,620
DDM one in three different sequence

445
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:47,800
contacts c GH d CH h associated with a

446
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:52,509
particular feature of chromatin and what

447
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:56,950
this shows is that nucleus own densities

448
00:20:52,509 --> 00:21:01,599
and histone modifications associated

449
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:04,150
with heterochromatin like h TK 9 and die

450
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,919
methylation are positively correlated

451
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:10,930
with loss of methylation in DDM

452
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,490
armenians and histone modifications

453
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,690
associated with euchromatin are

454
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:19,420
negatively correlated so a digimon is

455
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,700
much more required for heterochromatic

456
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,390
transposons and it's much less required

457
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,390
from a euchromatic

458
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:33,070
and the same thing in Reverse is true

459
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:37,629
for methylation guided by smaller names

460
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:40,250
this is the same kind of analysis for

461
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,320
methylation that depends on didi Wong

462
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,210
it's the component of our DDA I mean

463
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,240
here nucleus um density and

464
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:50,390
heterochromatin are negatively

465
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,849
correlated and euchromatin is positively

466
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,340
correlated so our DM doesn't work very

467
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:58,490
well in heterochromatin it works much

468
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,659
better in euchromatic but there's one

469
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,640
feature here really which isn't

470
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,950
heterochromatin or euchromatin it's

471
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,169
nucleus cells so nuclear some density

472
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,759
correlates negatively with with our DDM

473
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:10,640
and positively with with the game one

474
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,319
and we'll get back to that a little bit

475
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,759
later in the talk but basically for now

476
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,769
heterochromatin DDM while and

477
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,200
euchromatin

478
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:21,829
our DDM this is just a model summarizing

479
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:25,610
this this part of the talk where we have

480
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:27,829
a typical long heterochromatic transpose

481
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:30,319
on and and then short euchromatic

482
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:32,058
transpose on and their methylated

483
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,819
differently the euchromatic transpose of

484
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:37,250
lis methylated by this our DDM system

485
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:40,668
and the CH h methylation will be mostly

486
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:45,289
guided by DRMs where's the

487
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:46,549
heterochromatin requires dd m14 for DNA

488
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,970
methylation and this somehow allows

489
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:54,579
methylation by met one and 73 and 72 of

490
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,579
this of the strands possible

491
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,299
so this links the amount of

492
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,910
heterochromatin but it doesn't really

493
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,399
explain what it is about her chromatin

494
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:06,350
that makes DTM one important why is it

495
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,570
the BDD one heterochromatin more than

496
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,549
you Crump and this is where I work with

497
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:12,859
DD m1 intersected with our work with

498
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:22,639
another component of chromatin linker

499
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:25,309
histone h1 so h1 is a a very abundant

500
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,340
protein that's found in most eukaryotes

501
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:30,200
including in in plants and in animals

502
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,569
and this is a highly schematic picture

503
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,049
of this so this is a nucleus services

504
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:39,470
DNA coming coming in and out of the

505
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:41,750
nucleus own h1 binds to the DNA between

506
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,230
nucleosomes the so called linker DNA

507
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,420
that's why it's called linker histone

508
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:52,069
and it also binds though to the nucleus

509
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:53,420
zone and this this dual interaction with

510
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,490
the linker gained in the new and the

511
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,700
nucleus arm is hypothesized to kind of

512
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,309
be be a vice that stabilizes the nucleus

513
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,930
arm and so h1 is associated with

514
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:06,829
heterochromatin is associated with

515
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:10,910
inaccessible chromatin it can impede

516
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:12,619
nucleus and remodelling and we were

517
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,230
became interested in h1 because it's

518
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:18,619
been reported to cause interesting and

519
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:21,410
strange effects on DNA methylation in

520
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:23,509
various species so h1 mutations in the

521
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,540
fungus called thus Kabbalists were shown

522
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,160
to took the cause overall increase in

523
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,710
DNA methylation basically across the

524
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,470
genome methylation would increase in

525
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,860
mice a schwa mutations are published to

526
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,360
have a localized losses of DNA

527
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,009
methylation so certain particular

528
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,279
regions of the genome would lose DNA

529
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:45,079
methylation and their absence

530
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,970
study suggested that there were sort of

531
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,559
random effects in DNA methylation H

532
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,720
wrong mutations would cost increases and

533
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,259
decreases more or less randomly strategy

534
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,110
so very curious about this and the first

535
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:01,079
thing we actually did is the map h1

536
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:02,819
across the genome just to see where it

537
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,889
goes and not surprisingly it goes to

538
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:06,750
heterochromatin so there are two h1

539
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,830
genes in the rabbit OPS's h 1.1 which

540
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:13,339
one or two and this is these are chip

541
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:16,439
chip seek data where both of them

542
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:17,819
localized to around the centromere and

543
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,080
this is where heterochromatin is is

544
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:21,779
where most transposons in their ever

545
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,309
lives is live it's this protein is

546
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:24,539
highly enriched in heterochromatin and

547
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:29,399
we already sort of knew this from

548
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:33,990
psychology down many years ago and this

549
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,070
is a enrichment of h1 in transpose ions

550
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,180
because transposons live in

551
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,200
heterochromatin if something is

552
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,420
originally heterochromatin it will

553
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,259
generally be found in transposons

554
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,880
so both versions of each one are highly

555
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:46,230
enriched in transposons but there are

556
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,340
specifically duration heterochromatic

557
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:53,099
transpose so if we separate based on

558
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,589
histone modifications transposons is a

559
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,939
heterochromatic and euchromatic

560
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:58,619
then heterochromatic transposons are

561
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,860
highly enriched for h1 and euchromatic

562
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:03,779
transposon for not enriched at all so h1

563
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,609
is is an Arab lobsters heterochromatic

564
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,960
protein it's not only in heterochromatin

565
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:08,309
sexually found in genes too but it's

566
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,569
highly enriched in heterochromatic

567
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:16,230
control and in look we look at DNA

568
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:19,799
methylation we saw something was quite

569
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,599
interesting that h1 had kind of a dual

570
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,819
effect on DNA methylation it's most

571
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,799
obvious effect across the genome was an

572
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:31,669
increase so in all three sequence

573
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:34,200
contact CG ch3 and CH h h1 meetin's had

574
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,259
more methylation and transposons than

575
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,230
wild

576
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:41,500
and this was particularly dramatic at CH

577
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:43,778
demethylation but it was in all three

578
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,940
contacts but the shape of this

579
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:49,509
methylation was different right so it's

580
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,639
not this curve was a lot steeper here

581
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:53,558
that's a wild type and for thh

582
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:56,138
methylation you can actually see it it

583
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,569
intersects and it basically means that

584
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:59,918
shorter more chromatic elements actually

585
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:01,538
losing methylation and longer more

586
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,559
heterochromatic elements are getting in

587
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:08,288
and this is a more formal analysis of

588
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,609
this where we are dividing transposons

589
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:12,158
into heterochromatic and euchromatic

590
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:15,069
types and then we're comparing

591
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,870
methylation between h1 and wild-type and

592
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:18,908
plotting the overall distribution of the

593
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:22,439
differences between the h1 meetings in

594
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:24,309
the wild time so these these curves here

595
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,350
represent the distribution of the

596
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:29,950
methylation differences and so if the

597
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:32,138
curve is shifted to the right of of the

598
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,480
started line it means it's more

599
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:38,079
methylated than h1 the curve is shifted

600
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,298
to the left it means that these

601
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,599
sequences are less methylated in h1

602
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:46,359
mutants so for all three sequence

603
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,369
contacts heterochromatic transposons are

604
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:50,079
hyper methylated in h1 meetings and

605
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:53,349
there are methyl hyper methylated pretty

606
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:58,058
evenly so these these these brownish

607
00:27:53,349 --> 00:28:01,148
curves have a nice Gaussian shape you

608
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:04,960
chromatic elements shown in red lose DNA

609
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:06,369
methylation in in h1 and it was a bit

610
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,759
less evenly especially for CG

611
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:12,129
methylation there's this long tail and

612
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,769
so there are some sequences which have

613
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,380
very strong loss of cg methylation in

614
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:19,808
each one minutes so I think this helps

615
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,740
to reconcile some of the conflicting DNA

616
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:23,079
methylation data that have been

617
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,028
published about h1 so it does have two

618
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,668
effects it causes loss of methylation

619
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:29,619
and gains but in different sequences

620
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:32,669
because increases in heterochromatin and

621
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,668
losses in new crop

622
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:39,259
and this this generalized increase of

623
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,809
DNA methylation heracross in

624
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,879
heterochromatin looked a lot to us like

625
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:46,369
the opposite of what happens in DTM one

626
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,440
means DDM one we conceived a generalized

627
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:51,439
loss of DNA methylation heterochromatin

628
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,700
and here we have a generalized gain so

629
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,830
the curious what will happen if we

630
00:28:52,700 --> 00:29:00,650
actually put these put these mutants

631
00:28:54,829 --> 00:29:03,710
together and what happens is that in the

632
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:08,930
absence of h1 the DDM one phenotype is

633
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:12,740
is greatly greatly relieved so these are

634
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:15,980
distinct kinds of parts shown for h1 now

635
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:19,870
in green wild-type in in red

636
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:22,700
DVM one in blue and two replicates of

637
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:28,149
compound meetings between h1 DDM one in

638
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:30,830
brown and in all sequence contacts the

639
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:33,320
amount of DNA methylation in these h1

640
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:38,029
DDM one compound meetings are much

641
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:39,859
higher than so and this is particularly

642
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:42,440
dramatic to see th methylation where

643
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:44,979
here basically the compound mutants look

644
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,009
like h1

645
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,120
and this is just just examples of what

646
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:52,329
this looks like has heterochromatic

647
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,219
elements where wild-type isn't red

648
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:56,529
h1 is in green I think you can kind of

649
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,019
see if you look closely enough in this

650
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:01,299
element this effect where methylation is

651
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:04,509
increased in h1 but this very Jaggi kind

652
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,339
of outline turns out very smooth and in

653
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,950
em1 these transposons lose methylation

654
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:12,009
as pretty much all of them do and in the

655
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:15,240
compound meetings this this loss of

656
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,240
methylation is largely reversed

657
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:25,420
and if we examine what happens in these

658
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,900
compound beatings carefully was actually

659
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,550
fine is that this methylation dichotomy

660
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,040
between euchromatic and heterochromatic

661
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:34,769
transposons that exists in Digimon

662
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,119
beatings disappears

663
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:39,309
now heterochromatic and euchromatic

664
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,559
transposons are behaving more or less

665
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:44,919
the same with respect to methylation

666
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:49,329
laws and EDM 1 so I'll walk you through

667
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,870
this analysis these parts each of these

668
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:55,179
lines represents the ratio of

669
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:58,389
methylation between a mutant and wild

670
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:01,750
type so h1 is a ratio of H 1 to

671
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,910
wild-type this blue line is the h1 DDM

672
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,680
one compound meetings versus wild type

673
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,230
and the black is DD in one meeting

674
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,549
versus wild for the 3 sequence count

675
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:14,980
so for DM 1 it it shows the

676
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:18,240
characteristic d DM 1 phenotype where

677
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,940
I'm sorry and then we are arranging them

678
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,890
with respect to heterochromatin so the

679
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,630
most euchromatic transposons are here

680
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,759
the most heterochromatic transposons are

681
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,390
here this is counted as the amount of

682
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,859
this histone modification so transposons

683
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,350
are ranged from euchromatic to

684
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:36,939
heterochromatic and as we get from more

685
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:42,189
heterochromatic to more heterochromatic

686
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:45,670
transposon the DNA methylation drops

687
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,680
indeed em1 means in all 3 sequence

688
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:50,140
contacts

689
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,029
and in h1 these red lines due to the

690
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,740
opposite so there's a bit of loss in

691
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:56,410
euchromatic elements and a bit of gain

692
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,420
in heterochromatic elements this is a

693
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:04,390
curse and see and this occurs in see a

694
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:06,789
change and when we look at h1 DDM Wong

695
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:10,330
we find is something that looks very

696
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:13,289
much like h1 there's a relatively

697
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:16,389
relatively flat relationship for cg

698
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:20,259
there's same kind of shape here

699
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:24,550
as for h1 for CH D and almost identical

700
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:28,000
methylation in CH h and so if we

701
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:31,089
actually take h1 out of the equation if

702
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,279
we just superimpose these these patterns

703
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:39,000
so which are 3 th one is the background

704
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:41,369
and compare H 1 to H 1 DM 1 then we get

705
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,920
relatively flat lines for both of them

706
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:48,399
for all the contacts so what this is

707
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,539
saying is that when H 1 is gone then you

708
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,190
chromatic transpose downs and

709
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:52,750
heterochromatic transpose on sluicey and

710
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:59,110
immolations about the same extent it

711
00:32:52,750 --> 00:33:04,509
became on mutants and so the now the

712
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:07,319
more the more detailed model is that at

713
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:09,609
least a major thing that makes

714
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:13,629
heterochromatin required the game one is

715
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:15,219
H 1 that it's the presence of H wand and

716
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,380
heterochromatin that really really

717
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:21,000
requires the new one activity to allow

718
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,000
these methyl transferases to their jobs

719
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,400
but this model though still doesn't

720
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:31,349
explain what it is the DDM one does

721
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:35,190
exactly now what kind of activity does

722
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:37,439
it perform that along with methyl

723
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,850
transferases to do their jobs and how

724
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,549
does it actually interact with each one

725
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:45,209
does it remove each one is that what it

726
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:46,349
does and if that's what it does why do

727
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:50,430
actual meetings have only a partial

728
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:51,689
rescue of the D Game one phenotype so we

729
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,600
need a number of things to address this

730
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,269
and one of them is to examine the

731
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,909
relationship between D DM 1 and H 1 D DM

732
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:02,579
1 and Method DNA methylation and

733
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,110
nucleosomes this digimon of the nucleus

734
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:08,579
M remodeler and supposed to work on

735
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:10,529
nucleosomes so before I get get to the

736
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:14,429
data I just want to conceptually you

737
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:17,580
know explain what we are up against in

738
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:20,969
complex genomes like Kirby Dobbs's or or

739
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,829
humans for our mouths nucleosomes are

740
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:24,059
not arranged the same way or across the

741
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:26,750
genome and they're not they're not

742
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:28,590
arranged with equal reliability either

743
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,630
so there's some places in the genome

744
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:33,769
where nucleosomes are positioned

745
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:36,750
reliably which means that if you look at

746
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:38,519
chromosome one chromosome another

747
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,380
chromosome a third chromosome 10,000

748
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,179
chromosomes the nucleosomes are going to

749
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,130
be all pretty much in the same place and

750
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,960
when you average them together with

751
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,030
whatever analysis you're doing they're

752
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,059
going to get a nice representation of

753
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:54,870
the nucleus emplacement but in other

754
00:34:51,059 --> 00:35:00,090
parts of the genome there are equally

755
00:34:54,869 --> 00:35:02,609
some sort of positioned poorly we so in

756
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,559
one chromosome equation will be this

757
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,269
position and another chromosome Illume

758
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,579
in this position another chromosome will

759
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:10,679
be in this position this doesn't mean

760
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:13,440
these nucleus oops are not stable it's

761
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,639
just that every time chromatin is

762
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,110
assembled after cell division the

763
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,929
nucleation will occupy outright a

764
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,019
different place

765
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:22,759
and when you average all of this you get

766
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,440
out something like that right you don't

767
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,110
really get much useful information out

768
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,970
of this so if you're trying to

769
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:31,190
understand how something like DNA

770
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:33,109
methylation relates to nucleus ohms the

771
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,240
first the first order of business is to

772
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,760
find places that look like this because

773
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,529
there are the one there is where you can

774
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,480
learn something places look like this

775
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,370
basically scramble all the information

776
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,829
about about where nucleosomes is really

777
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:50,089
certain each individual piece of DNA so

778
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,409
with this in mind I'm going to skip a

779
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:58,630
lot of analysis and kind of just get to

780
00:35:51,409 --> 00:36:01,819
the point so this is a heat map where

781
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,349
the redder the color the higher the

782
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,019
feature and so this is a heat map of

783
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:08,869
nucleosomes in h1 DD in one meetings

784
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:11,480
each line is a different piece of DNA

785
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:13,460
and this is centered on a well

786
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,510
positioned nucleus on it so these

787
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,190
represent these reliably positioned

788
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,590
areas of the genome these are places in

789
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,690
the genome where nucleus arms sit in in

790
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:27,440
more or less the same places in all the

791
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:32,720
cells and I'm going to look at DNA

792
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,139
methylation there what you get is

793
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:39,439
something that looks

794
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:41,690
similarly equally well well arranged so

795
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,760
this is now CG methylation these h1 edmo

796
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,929
means I mean so rad will be more

797
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,560
methylation blue will be less the

798
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:53,940
methylation is in well well-defined

799
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:59,650
stripes that are in between the nucleus

800
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:02,108
and this is a a just a averaging of this

801
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,980
this type of data compressed into a

802
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:09,519
single into a into a single single

803
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,920
averaged graph so the gray are the

804
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,349
nucleosomes so this this would be this

805
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,630
bright nucleus on here

806
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:19,480
the and the solid lines are DNA

807
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:23,650
methylation in the cg context the the

808
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:28,260
blue is h1 black is wild-type brown is

809
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:31,180
h1 DTM one and orange is DDM one so this

810
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,400
this brown line just represents the

811
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:36,460
average of this data where DNA

812
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,470
methylation is now highly periodic and

813
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,599
it oscillates between very low levels of

814
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:42,579
DNA methylation in the nucleus on cores

815
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,710
where DNA is wrapped around the histones

816
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:47,500
and nearly wild-type levels of

817
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:50,199
methylation in the linker DNA between

818
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,909
equals and you can see the same thing in

819
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:58,119
the match to the much smaller extent

820
00:37:51,909 --> 00:38:01,629
indeed em1 meetings where the

821
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,429
there's more methylation remaining in

822
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,769
the space between nucleus films and

823
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:10,839
there's essentially no methylation where

824
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:12,550
nuclear some sets see the same thing for

825
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,210
the other kinds of DNA methylation this

826
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:18,820
is for CH G and now you can see that

827
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,289
this oscillation actually exists in all

828
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,030
genotypes including in wild-type

829
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:25,659
there's a preference for for meekley

830
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:33,070
some linkers but it's much much more

831
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:35,170
dramatic in NH 1d dm1 and it's the same

832
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,780
for CH h I didn't put h1 and wild I've

833
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,119
here because the lines intersect it'll

834
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,310
be much much too confusing but it's it

835
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,769
basically looks similar to this where

836
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:46,960
you have this periodicity that is very

837
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:54,780
very prominent in h1 Digimon double

838
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:58,659
mutants but not in DD m1 okay good so I

839
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,910
remember I told you that DM 1 actually

840
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:04,480
has a mammalian homologue called LS h

841
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:06,460
and so we wanted to see if we could we

842
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,619
could basically see the same kind of

843
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,389
phenomenon going on in LS h meetings and

844
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:13,750
there's DNA methylation data are

845
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:16,329
available for LS h mutant Mouse cells so

846
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:21,309
this is a graph what we're doing is we

847
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:23,440
are aligning sequences centered on the

848
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:27,460
binding sites of a protein called CT CL

849
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,679
ctcf is a is a mammalian protein that is

850
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,760
well known to orient people systems

851
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,379
around this so it kind of forms

852
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,300
well-positioned to do some surveys

853
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:40,599
around it and it also depletes DNA

854
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:43,330
methylation where it binds so the grey

855
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:46,360
line here are nucleosomes in in Mouse

856
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,739
cells around cdcf sites and they show

857
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,539
some periodicity

858
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:52,299
and the blue line is wild-type DNA

859
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:55,480
methylation the right the red line is LS

860
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,920
th mutants DNA methylation in wild-type

861
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,630
there's a little bit of fear this to

862
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,700
here but in LS h there is much more

863
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,950
pronounced for your disappea it looks a

864
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,809
fair bit like the beard esteem DDM one

865
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:06,608
but this analysis is much much cooler

866
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:08,259
than what we did here and Arab adopters

867
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:12,969
and it's actually something that my

868
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:14,530
postdoc just did yesterday but I so this

869
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,730
needs a lot of work but I just wanted to

870
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,490
show this to you because I think it

871
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,289
shows that this really works more or

872
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:27,039
less the same probably in plants and

873
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:31,659
animals and I'll explain what we think

874
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:34,838
these data means using this model so at

875
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:39,389
least a large part of how we think this

876
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:42,159
works is that if we start with with

877
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:43,659
chromatin the DNA is wrapped in

878
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,809
nucleosomes and in between its

879
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:50,819
associated with lingo here's an h1 and

880
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:53,320
then what the Game one does is it it's

881
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,289
that's what inclusive modelers do it

882
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,970
moves or partially disassembles equus

883
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,559
arms or perhaps what it can do is can

884
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:03,399
make a loop of DNA it comes out of the

885
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:06,099
nucleus on and for this activity it

886
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,710
makes the DNA accessible to methyl

887
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:10,330
transferases like Matt Juan because h1

888
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,220
actually doesn't just bind the linker

889
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:13,809
DNA it also binds to the niqua some

890
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:16,389
surface it's very hard to imagine how

891
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:19,929
DTM one can do what it does without also

892
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:21,969
disrupting contacts with h1 so we think

893
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:24,489
it just it comes in there - it remodels

894
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:28,469
nucleosomes it kicks out a Chuang and it

895
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:28,469
exposes DNA to the DNA methyltransferase

896
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,759
if we don't have h1 in the system then

897
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:36,099
the linkers are that much more

898
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,210
accessible to DNA methyltransferases

899
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:42,338
and this we think is a part of the

900
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,940
reason why in h1 meetings

901
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:48,699
heterochromatin is hypermethylated

902
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,920
because linker DNA is more methylated

903
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:52,989
considers here we're in each one

904
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,210
meetings when cardina is more methylated

905
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:56,949
it's actually true for all sequence

906
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,240
context including see Jesus you can't

907
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:03,308
really see the oscillation very well at

908
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:08,348
this at the scale when you don't have

909
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:10,210
dm1 then there isn't a remodeler to

910
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:15,849
allow the methyltransferases to access

911
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:19,000
the DNA but the h1 is not as stable as

912
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:20,650
the nucleosomes let's know that h1 comes

913
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,750
on and off it's a rather relatively

914
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,630
stable protein in its association with

915
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:31,269
DNA but not nearly as stable as nucleus

916
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:34,390
and so this this dynamic binding and

917
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:36,369
binding of h1 allows some access to DNA

918
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:38,409
methyltransferases indeed em1 movements

919
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:40,630
and so this agent we think is why you

920
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:42,608
see some methylation in the linkers for

921
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:46,358
each one of Digimon meetings but not in

922
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:48,909
the course and then in the double

923
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:51,969
mutants in h1 DDM 1 there still isn't a

924
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:54,429
remodeler 2 to allow access to the

925
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:58,868
nucleus home of course but the linkers

926
00:42:54,429 --> 00:43:01,629
are relatively available because each

927
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:04,329
one isn't there and because each one is

928
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,400
concentrated in heterochromatin this

929
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:08,829
removal of h1 has a much stronger effect

930
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,329
on heterochromatin right you lose h1 and

931
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:11,619
heterochromatin becomes much more

932
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,740
accessible and you chromatin doesn't

933
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:16,630
change too much and so then an H 1 D

934
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:19,558
game one they get this really big

935
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:23,680
difference in heterochromatin between

936
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,569
between cores and linkers because the

937
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,129
linkers are accessible now without h1

938
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:28,929
but the cores are still relatively

939
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,440
inaccessible because the game one isn't

940
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:32,818
there

941
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,269
okay so that's the that's the basic

942
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,588
model where where how well we have it

943
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:39,389
developed so far it's not quite this

944
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:42,119
simple but this is this is a first

945
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:44,639
approximation of how we think h-1b dm1

946
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,608
influenced DNA methylation this is the

947
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,969
finish of the talk I want to go a little

948
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:52,619
bit into into evolutionary biology

949
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:54,269
because in my lab this is actually a

950
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,599
substantial interest try to understand

951
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:59,068
how DNA methylation evolved and we've

952
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,470
with profound DNA methylation in a

953
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:05,849
number of different species and when we

954
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:08,969
saw this pattern of methylation this was

955
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:12,088
a pretty strong strong feeling of deja

956
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:13,679
vu because we've seen this before and

957
00:44:12,088 --> 00:44:18,409
we've seen this before

958
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:20,399
in in other species so in our analysis

959
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:21,960
some of the species that we've looked at

960
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,440
is a particular group of green algae

961
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:29,159
called the Mamillius

962
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:31,889
so green algae which is to say plants

963
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:38,190
are very diverse group of organisms

964
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:42,150
which embryo fides of which land plants

965
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:44,130
are part make up just one branch and our

966
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,000
knowledge about these guys in general

967
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,858
and about the DNA methylation

968
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,389
specifically is highly limited so we

969
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:50,130
have a lot of knowledge about their

970
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:52,199
epidermis is DNA methylation is present

971
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,900
in these sequence contacts we have some

972
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,568
knowledge about DNA methylation in a

973
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,170
couple of other groups of algae like the

974
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:00,449
group

975
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:04,730
welcome to the Morrises and also the

976
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:07,649
species called but a lot of these other

977
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,969
groups here are a bit of a mystery and

978
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,960
so we will tune this this particular

979
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:16,558
group which we did partly because it's

980
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,019
it's a very very tiny these are smallest

981
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,309
free-living eukaryotes and were curious

982
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:22,588
to know what what they were doing with

983
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:24,630
their DNA methylation and both of these

984
00:45:22,588 --> 00:45:27,840
guys are both of these species that we

985
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:30,119
looked at have cg methylation

986
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,320
in their genomes and this piece is

987
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,579
actually quite diverse they're about

988
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,710
five hundred million years they works

989
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,889
from each other but the pattern of

990
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:41,000
methylation was very odd this pattern of

991
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:43,440
methylation was so these are

992
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,849
representative parts of the genome from

993
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,019
these two species where the methylation

994
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:52,650
is in blue and the exons are are in

995
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:54,329
green so these species have methylation

996
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,690
throughout their genome except in

997
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:59,219
promoters and it's present in this very

998
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,409
regular pattern where there's a short

999
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:02,819
patch of DNA methylation followed by a

1000
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:05,579
gap in the short patch and a gap on a

1001
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,700
short pettish passionate gap and this

1002
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,989
this pattern is nucleus all so but by

1003
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:13,829
mapping nucleosomal so they could show

1004
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:15,929
is that the methylation fits between the

1005
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:18,569
nucleosomes so in these species this is

1006
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:20,549
now representative genes methylation

1007
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,990
isn't blue nucleosome certain gray and

1008
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,880
the methylation fits right between the

1009
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:27,239
nucleosomes

1010
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:32,150
and this is a more sorry this is a more

1011
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:38,489
general analysis where we're aligning at

1012
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:41,190
zero the first methylated base in each

1013
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:43,799
one of these methylated clusters so

1014
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,940
we're taking for our starting point the

1015
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,170
transition between unmethylated

1016
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,789
methylated DNA and averaging methylation

1017
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,539
going out 500 base pairs in both

1018
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:55,829
directions or nucleosomes in in gray and

1019
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:57,900
so what this analysis show is that

1020
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:59,639
actually the relationship and DNA

1021
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,170
methylation and nucleosomes is very very

1022
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,789
strict in these genomes the methylation

1023
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,070
is all present between nuclei so that's

1024
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:10,219
basically never present in the nucleus

1025
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:12,930
of the core so these genomes have

1026
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:14,789
everywhere and by default the kind of

1027
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:17,429
methylation pattern that we find in

1028
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:18,690
rabid abscess transposons really mutate

1029
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:22,559
h1 and

1030
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:24,000
together and the thing is this kind of

1031
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,909
methylation pattern wasn't just present

1032
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,179
in these in these green algae it's

1033
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:33,059
actually present in several very deeply

1034
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:34,309
branching lineages of eukaryotes so this

1035
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,699
is a reasonably representative

1036
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:41,088
representative tree of eukaryotic

1037
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:43,949
diversity where the groups that have

1038
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:46,828
this kind of linker specific DNA

1039
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:50,309
methylation are in red and other groups

1040
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:55,680
that have DNA methylation everywhere are

1041
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:58,949
in green and what was very puzzling

1042
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,500
about this was that this linker specific

1043
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:04,318
pattern of methylation was interspersed

1044
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,019
with species which didn't have it it

1045
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:10,920
wasn't confined to one particular part

1046
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:12,269
of the training so this group of green

1047
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,500
algae I just told you about helps us

1048
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:15,210
better in the methylation but other

1049
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,940
green algae don't and land plants don't

1050
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:20,030
help divides have a very very similar

1051
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:23,550
pattern DNA methylation to these guys

1052
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:26,810
there however are very distantly related

1053
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:30,300
to other eukaryotes it's hard hard to to

1054
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:33,179
to make much of these but instrument

1055
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,800
vials brown algae have a pattern

1056
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:38,969
basically indistinguishable from these

1057
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:43,140
green algae but diatoms the derivatives

1058
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:44,818
have very normal-looking methylation of

1059
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:45,929
transposons that doesn't appear to be

1060
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:50,449
confined to linkage at all at least

1061
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:53,578
based on looking at the whole genome and

1062
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:56,098
none of the animals of plants or fungi

1063
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:59,550
we've looked at has very highly linked

1064
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,530
to limited methylation either so we

1065
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,630
couldn't really understand how this was

1066
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:06,630
how this was possible but I think I

1067
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,099
think our data with h1 and dm1 suggests

1068
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,838
an explanation that it's actually not

1069
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:13,410
that difficult the transition between

1070
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:15,659
these two kinds of patterns now we can

1071
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:18,179
convert a rabid abscess at least in part

1072
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:20,309
of its genome from a overall methylation

1073
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:22,889
pattern to a linker specific pattern by

1074
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:24,088
making basically three mutations DDM 1 &amp;

1075
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:26,068
2 H 1 probe

1076
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:29,788
I think it's rather easy to imagine how

1077
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:32,308
small regulatory changes in nucleus of

1078
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:34,229
remodeling can give you a species where

1079
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:39,749
methylation is only in linkers 4 where

1080
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:42,118
methylation is everywhere so I will end

1081
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:45,929
here I'll just thank the people who did

1082
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:48,798
the work the CMT 2 analysis without done

1083
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:52,018
by a graduate student in Hongzhi the

1084
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:54,268
early work on h 1 d DM 1 was done by a

1085
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:56,788
former postdoc of sows emic and a former

1086
00:49:54,268 --> 00:50:00,149
graduate student Yvonne Kim the more

1087
00:49:56,789 --> 00:50:03,089
recent work on the g1 LS h was from a

1088
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:05,338
current postdoctoral fellow fellow David

1089
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:06,989
Lyons and the evolutionary work I

1090
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:16,619
mentioned at the end was that of a

1091
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:18,389
former postdoc a Jason house this has

1092
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:24,140
been a production of Cornell University

1093
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:24,139
