1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,678
University so I've been the leader of

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,480
Nua for about 10 years

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,359
um and uh it's been it's been

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,640
interesting it's been

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,840
exciting so what is

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,560
Nua it's a knowledge Network essentially

8
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,719
Farmers share data through the network

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,479
providing us with feedback and guidance

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,200
of how to use that data and better

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,600
presented on the web to them the weather

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,000
data is collected every 15 minutes and

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,960
tabulated in hourly and daily summary

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,159
tables we're collecting precipitation

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,198
temperature dupoint temperature humidity

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:52,238
Leaf wetness solar radiation wind speed

17
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,399
and wind direction and now uh the

18
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,198
company that provides the weather

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,879
instruments rainwise Incorporated has

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:01,878
allowed people to add two optional

21
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:05,039
sensors and the most uh popular shall we

22
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:08,158
say Are soil temperature and soil

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,080
moisture we designate sister stations

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,080
within the network to plug in data where

25
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,560
we have missing data so that for

26
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,118
instance if we're accumulating degree

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,320
days we don't have an oops you know a

28
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,118
week or so of missing data and the

29
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,679
degree day value would be erroneous and

30
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,680
we extrapolate 1 hour gaps in our

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,960
data essentially what we're doing is

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,360
we're we're creating with that data

33
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:39,039
decision support tools for IPM and Crop

34
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,078
Production so a little bit about noa's

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,840
history it was created in 1996 by Kurt

36
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,718
petol who was the vegetable IPM

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,040
coordinator in the New York State IPM

38
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:52,359
program it started out as an

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,079
association with membership levels

40
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:59,159
different pay membership levels today

41
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,359
it's free access with land grant and

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,520
grower support

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,239
to provide some funding we initially

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,438
were using sensor and Campbell

45
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,239
instruments sensor was bought by a

46
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,000
company called sensotronic those

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,719
stations became Obsolete and today we've

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,519
got rainwise Incorporated weather

49
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:19,039
instruments onset instruments we serve

50
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,239
up airport location data as well as

51
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,239
state climatology mezzet through our

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,400
Network initially we were going out and

53
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,599
manually downloading the data from

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,519
computers putting that data into a fax

55
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:35,079
and faxing that information out to

56
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,120
Growers or we were recording messages on

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,920
what was called a Koda phone for those

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,920
of you who might remember those days uh

59
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,719
and then Growers could dial that number

60
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:49,039
and find out what the report dour was

61
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,840
but uh then we went to modems and we

62
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,439
were collecting data every day and

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,519
serving it up on a website today we've

64
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,400
got a few instruments that are still

65
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,840
connected in through file transfer

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,959
protocol or FTP

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,120
um we're trying to phase that out

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,799
rainwise wrote that software for us the

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,439
majority are connected in through the

70
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,799
internet through an internet interface

71
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,479
that comes with the weather instrument

72
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,959
and uh rainwise just launched launched a

73
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:22,679
cellular data plan and has a cellular

74
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:26,120
modem instrument as well we now have as

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,120
of yesterday or the day before 375

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,280
active weather stations in the network I

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,000
think a total is probably pushing closer

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
to 400 but they come and go as they're

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
taken out for maintenance or what have

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,239
you as as you can imagine these are

81
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,799
instruments on the ground collecting

82
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,120
data and we're we've got a footprint in

83
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,080
20 States primarily in the East

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Northeast and into the Midwest we have

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,159
10 member states plus some individual

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,840
members growers in non-member states can

87
00:03:53,158 --> 00:04:00,280
now join so Nua is open access providing

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,400
data in real time query based decision

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,000
support models with built-in biofix or

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,158
the ability of Growers to enter their

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,719
own biofix information for for the

92
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:10,840
models the models are interactive with a

93
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,919
a user

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,079
interface this is just to give you a

95
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,639
snapshot of the homepage nu. cornell.edu

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't really you know this is kind of

97
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,400
like the sequencing slide you don't have

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,759
to read this it's okay so uh basically

99
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,038
the key is that there's a blue menu that

100
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,360
follows you throughout the website and

101
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:33,240
you can access

102
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,400
weather data pest forecast station Pages

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,319
crop management models and some crop

104
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,239
pages that we have to serve up IP

105
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,038
information and other information of use

106
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,038
to the grower as well as some

107
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:47,478
information about weather stations so if

108
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,719
a grower wanted to buy a weather

109
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:54,240
instrument they could and they would be

110
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,800
able to learn how to do that um the Blue

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
menu on the website provides the

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
interactive

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,039
tools and a a neat thing that I've used

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,319
quite a bit is up here in the corner is

115
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,120
a National Weather Service little query

116
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,038
box um so you can put in your city and

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,918
state hit go and you'll go to the

118
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,639
National Weather Service site and you'll

119
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,719
be able to find out what the forecast is

120
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,879
for your

121
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,840
location as of now as many of you know

122
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:26,240
the internet knows where you are at all

123
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:29,119
times okay so big brother is watching

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,759
and this map will save to your location

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,879
and send enter the next time you come in

126
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,240
on where you're located so um you know

127
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,079
for a lot of you Millennials and stuff

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,240
that's really cool you're excited about

129
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,800
that for people like me it's

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,199
like somebody knows where I am I don't

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,639
know if I can handle it so but anyway

132
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,319
it's kind of cool because then you know

133
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,160
it basically centers the map for you and

134
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,759
you don't have to move it and and

135
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,919
whatnot there are station Pages for

136
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,479
every weather station in the network and

137
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,560
these provide quick links to Tool tools

138
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:06,000
they are built on default biofix dates

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,000
based on historic records that faculty

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,240
have for Apple insects grape phenology

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,680
stages things like that or typical

142
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,079
planting dates for onions or potatoes

143
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,199
Etc so um although these aren't

144
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,839
interactive you can still get to the

145
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,000
interactive results but these are quick

146
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,198
links for Degree Days daily and hourly

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,279
summaries and then pest forecast quick

148
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,960
links gives you a lat lawn elevation

149
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,439
tells you the station sensors the last

150
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,239
good download date uh that occurred at

151
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,240
that station

152
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,360
location so this gives you a snapshot of

153
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,959
noa's current

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,680
map um I grabbed this snippet off the

155
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,120
website I think again day before

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,478
yesterday or yesterday and this is

157
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,720
zoomed in here on New York

158
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,159
um this is the entire map here and it

159
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
shows that we're now reaching into

160
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,479
Minnesota we've got individuals in the

161
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,198
plains Nebraska Iowa Illinois and then

162
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:14,439
most recently Virginia became a member

163
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,720
and North Carolina so uh we're moving to

164
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,199
the South which kind of makes for a

165
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,000
little nail biting of you know are the

166
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,800
models really useful down there so we do

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,120
a lot of discussion with the faculty

168
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,918
that are requesting expansion of NOA to

169
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,000
make sure that it's going to be

170
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,598
applicable

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,598
so why am I here well number one I

172
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,478
contacted Jeff and I said hey Jeff can I

173
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,000
give a seminar on NOA everybody's been

174
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:40,800
telling me I got to get the word out you

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
know I got to tell Cornell University

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,240
about this so I said okay let's do this

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,680
and he said all right so how might Nua

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,280
benefit programs in soil and crop

179
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,400
Sciences well Nua basically now is

180
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,119
operating the weather stations on your

181
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,198
research Farms the Aurora

182
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,000
station the willsboro station and the

183
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,158
station at shayz minor are the stations

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,279
that are on your research Farms Musgrave

185
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:13,759
research Farm willsboro research farm

186
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:16,638
and wh minor Institute so um I've worked

187
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,800
with the Cornell um facilities the

188
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,960
Cornell oh my gosh a experiment station

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,400
yes Julie I'm at the New York State a

190
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,959
experiment station you guys are the

191
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,079
Cornell University egg experiment

192
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,000
station so I've been working with the

193
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,000
facilities director to get these weather

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,599
stations plugged in on the various

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,120
research Farms that Cornell operates

196
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,000
right now we really don't have very many

197
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,599
tools for agronomic crops we do have an

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,639
alala Weevil tool that is built on a

199
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,560
degre day model that Ray CRS developed

200
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,679
uh back in the day and then obviously

201
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,359
we've got a number of degree days that I

202
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:56,439
think might be of use to uh agronomic

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,480
crops so the two main reasons that I'm

204
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,640
here one is to stimulate your thinking

205
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,680
about developing and utilizing NOA to

206
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,879
benefit agriculture how might that

207
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,719
happen what is your vision contact us

208
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,200
let us know and also to raise awareness

209
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,839
of what Nua has to

210
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,040
offer so to that end I'm going to give

211
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,240
you a little sampling of the predictive

212
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,480
models or what is increasingly these are

213
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,159
being called tools now I always used to

214
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,600
call them models so if I say models or

215
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,919
tools you'll know that it's a

216
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,320
transitioning terminology and I

217
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,078
basically mean the same thing so we've

218
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,399
got phenology models for plant diseases

219
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,679
and insects crop management tools and

220
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,240
weather products again they're realtime

221
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,639
query based decision support with

222
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,799
built-in biofix or an interactive user

223
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,319
interface where they can enter the

224
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:52,599
biofix this is the pest forecast menu

225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,240
right here off of the web and basically

226
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,200
we've got 14 plant disease Tools 11

227
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,839
insect phenology tools these are now

228
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,278
increasingly most most of them are

229
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,440
providing a 5-day forecast look into the

230
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,439
future so that a grower can prepare if

231
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,959
they know they're going to be at risk

232
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,000
for a certain disease or insect

233
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,359
developmental stage they can get their

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
spray set up and go out and apply that

235
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,800
spray in a timely fashion they can

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
assess that risk learn IPM info and get

237
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,000
decision support through these tools and

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,559
again they're

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
interactive so this just gives you a a

240
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,838
snippet of the great forecast models

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,278
that are available in NOA most of the

242
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,040
models that are served up on the website

243
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,078
have a little utility here on the left

244
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,120
hand side of the page where you would

245
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:45,559
select a disease or insect for grapes

246
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,720
everything is on one page so you would

247
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,039
select we have grape Berry moth grape

248
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,040
diseases or DM cast which is a

249
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,319
simulation model for grape vine Downey

250
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,199
mildew available from this page we are

251
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,879
building now because we're in so many

252
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,720
states we'll have a state select the

253
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,480
state and then the weather station

254
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,278
location is selected we default to the

255
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,720
current date but you can go back in time

256
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,519
so you can select a historic date as

257
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,278
well obviously I needed to do that to

258
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,399
create this snippet by going back to

259
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:22,240
last spring when you first go onto the

260
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,240
page the map tab is active so if you

261
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,600
don't know the weather station location

262
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,759
you'll when you select the state here

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,959
will be the IM of the map centered and

264
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,519
you can zoom in on that so that you can

265
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,559
then decide well I think this is really

266
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,759
the geographic region I'm interested in

267
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,399
you click on the icon on the map and the

268
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,838
name of the weather station location

269
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,958
plugs in there so after you've decided

270
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,680
your ending date you hit calculate and

271
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,439
the results pop up on the results Tab

272
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,919
and then there's more info we might have

273
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,880
fact sheets uh information on how to use

274
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,479
the model more effectively that type of

275
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,200
thing in the more info tab

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,800
so here you can see a pretty common

277
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,040
format that we use is a table showing

278
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:13,399
the two past days the current

279
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,958
date and the forecast days on this one

280
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,799
we actually tabulate three diseases of

281
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,119
grapes phomopsis powdery Milo and black

282
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,479
rot a little bit of information about

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,320
those models is here what the models are

284
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,920
doing what they're

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,680
calculating the grower can change the

286
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,599
phenological state age we're estimating

287
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:37,159
that 10-in Chute growth is where we're

288
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,800
at on May 29th of last year this is

289
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,799
based on

290
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,120
conquered a variety of grapes that is

291
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:47,120
grown for juice it's probably the

292
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,320
largest number of acreage of any variety

293
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,278
of grapes grown in New York but in this

294
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,839
region most Growers are growing wine

295
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,838
grape varieties they might be growing

296
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,360
Chardonnay

297
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,360
reeling and so they can change the

298
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,039
phenological stage the other thing is my

299
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,519
colleague in IPM was telling we were

300
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,639
talking about how spring is kind of

301
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,799
we're all nail biting because spring is

302
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,639
here and yet it's not really April so

303
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,399
one of the things that can happen is you

304
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,000
can go from 3in Shoot growth in grapes

305
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,559
to 12in shoot growth in grapes in a

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,759
matter of 3 days if it's really hot and

307
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,838
so this gives flexibility to the model

308
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,639
and changing this may change the disease

309
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,480
management messages so these go you

310
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,320
would scroll down the page and then you

311
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,120
would get to the disease management

312
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,000
messages for each of the diseases in

313
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,480
this model so that gives you a

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,120
perspective on how most of the models

315
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,240
work some of the crop management tools

316
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,519
that we have not that many we have three

317
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,320
primarily focused around

318
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,679
apples they again are assessing risk

319
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,199
providing decision support and they're

320
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,719
Prim arily are focused on crop load

321
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,479
management

322
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,480
irrigation and freeze

323
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,959
risk this is the Cornell Apple

324
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,239
carbohydrate thinning model again

325
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,399
there's the utility on the left to enter

326
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,759
the weather station it'll have the state

327
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,039
selection

328
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,159
soon the current date or the date of

329
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,879
Interest would be selected the results

330
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,360
tab will show up and the grower would

331
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,480
enter their green tip date in the h

332
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,278
Valley were already at green tip and

333
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,759
apples not yet in the Lake Ontario

334
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,078
region

335
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,680
thankfully they would enter their Bloom

336
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,278
date and then there's a button here and

337
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,879
they would click calculate this table

338
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,958
then builds

339
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:52,320
below this utility to

340
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,879
provide these data related to the tree

341
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,000
carbohydrate

342
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,039
status starting from the green tip date

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
down to the current date that you've

344
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,480
selected which is the green

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,759
row light blue rows above tan rows below

346
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,360
are building the forecast down in time

347
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,839
and then below this is the carbohydrate

348
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,039
balance of the

349
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,279
chart and the end user can scroll along

350
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,799
this and little popup boxes will show up

351
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:23,919
saying the date and the carbohydrate

352
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:27,240
balance so giving basically what is

353
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,838
being shown at that point on that graph

354
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,318
the take-home message for your purposes

355
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:37,160
is if the tree is in deficit if it's in

356
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,399
carbohydrate balance deficit it's going

357
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,919
to be easier for the grower to thin the

358
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,278
apples off the tree so they have to

359
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:48,399
reduce their thinner rate if the

360
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,360
carbohydrate balance is in the PO on the

361
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,159
positive side on the plus side it's

362
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,278
going to be harder to thin the apples

363
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,039
off the tree has a lot of reserved

364
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,639
carbohydrate they're going to hang on to

365
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,599
all that fruit they're going to be able

366
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,318
to ripen that fruit so it's going to be

367
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,480
harder to thin and that's what this

368
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,278
model does it's going to tell them to

369
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,920
either increase the chemical thinner

370
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:12,318
rate or decrease the chemical thinner

371
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,120
rate this model is probably the biggest

372
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:17,120
driver in terms of end users putting

373
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,639
weather stations on their Farm it is

374
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,639
huge in terms of crop quality crop value

375
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,519
if you thin your crop too much you don't

376
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,560
have a crop if you under thin you don't

377
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,000
grow premium quality apples that are big

378
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:36,559
and bring a premium

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
price this is a new utility that was

380
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,119
developed by Arte atano the northeast

381
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,559
regional climate center that is

382
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,639
estimating 2in soil temperature across

383
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,318
the Northeast so these tools that are

384
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,120
developed by the climate Center provide

385
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:57,159
outputs like this they're colorcoded

386
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,278
maps that generate this graphic and you

387
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:03,318
can see here as a of two days

388
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:06,439
ago the soils were warming in the Hudson

389
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:09,599
Valley but they were still kind of cold

390
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,919
in the atex up in Maine and then to a

391
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,918
certain extent along Lake

392
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Ontario what are some of the weather

393
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,879
products that you might be interested in

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,679
so on the weather product menu what I've

395
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,280
done is I've highlighted this because

396
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,480
this is new as of this month we just

397
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,319
rewrote the degre day calculator that

398
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,640
art ello and I had created about I don't

399
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:40,159
know 12 years ago or so 8 years ago um

400
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,400
and when we migrated our database the

401
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,240
programming language wasn't compatible

402
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,559
so we've just kind of resurrected this

403
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,919
and we're really excited about it but

404
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,000
basically under weather data you can get

405
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,480
degree day tables for 11 base

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,319
temperatures and they accumulate from

407
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,360
January 1st March 1st April 1st 1 and

408
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:06,279
May 1st again based on end user requests

409
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,158
these base temperatures usually

410
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:13,720
are uh borrowed from the models that we

411
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:16,840
have that we've built in Nua so um for

412
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,519
instance this 32 is for apples scab

413
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:22,678
ascospore

414
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:25,519
maturity um I think 4C is for cabbage

415
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,519
maggot this bizarre one is for grape

416
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,440
Berry moth because the research was done

417
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,319
in degrees Centigrade

418
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,080
and the translation ended up being you

419
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:37,038
know

420
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:39,879
4714 f um we will serve up our hourly

421
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,640
data in tables summarized and these are

422
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,000
month-by-month tables providing daily

423
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,440
summary tables and then again the degree

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,519
day calculator so I'll spend a little

425
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,240
bit more time on this because I think

426
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,158
this is an area that is growing and I've

427
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,960
been explaining this to our end users

428
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,120
and they're seeing how important this

429
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,079
can be to document issues that have

430
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,798
occurred if they've particularly got

431
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,158
crop insurance or something like that

432
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,839
and they need these data they need to be

433
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:11,799
able to document them and print them off

434
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,158
or what have you so it was a mild winter

435
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:18,158
right yeah it was a mild winter except

436
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:21,120
for um Valentine's Day there was a

437
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,720
significant freeze event on Valentine's

438
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,959
Day and in Highland New York which is in

439
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,759
the Hudson Valley the the Data Logger

440
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,120
the weather station recorded this event

441
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,079
so in the hourly data you can see how

442
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:38,918
the the tables are presented and you can

443
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:41,439
see each hour how cold it

444
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:45,720
got if we look at the daily summary

445
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,240
table for this same event you'll see how

446
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,798
the minimum was

447
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,798
-10.6 de f with fairly cold weather each

448
00:19:51,798 --> 00:20:00,079
day preceding and after that event but

449
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:01,960
before that it was actually really mild

450
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,798
um my colleagues in the Hudson Valley

451
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,000
have been out cutting buds on Peach and

452
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,679
sweet cherry and pretty much the peach

453
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,200
crop down there is toast most of the

454
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,960
flower buds were killed and the sweet

455
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,600
cherries the jury is still out on that

456
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,600
so this again it gives the grower a

457
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:22,038
perspective they can look back in time

458
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:24,079
and see how cold did it get for how long

459
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,759
to know whether their crop whether

460
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,199
particular varieties that they know are

461
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,079
Hardy or not Hardy were damaged

462
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,400
on the other end of the spectrum when we

463
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,599
talk about severe rain events I was Dow

464
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,960
giving a talk in North Carolina which

465
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,439
again is is a new partner for newa and I

466
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,319
said hey you know what was a weird event

467
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,240
that that that occurred that I could go

468
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,000
back and grab the data and and share

469
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,880
with the Growers and show them how they

470
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,279
can access that and they said my gosh we

471
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:57,480
got like 5 Ines of rain in three days in

472
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,240
October and we were trying to harvest

473
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,839
and it was impossible and we couldn't

474
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,480
get out to harvest so I went and sure

475
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,439
enough uh this weather station that went

476
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,120
in last year Hendersonville North

477
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,679
Carolina went to the all- weather data

478
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,278
utility this really should say October

479
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,798
but I think I was just too lazy to

480
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,599
update it for the purposes of that but

481
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,918
these are the October data this is the

482
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:27,439
hourly table for that event and you can

483
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,840
see a third of an inch of rain to almost

484
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,720
a half of an inch of rain was being

485
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:36,000
logged by The Tipping bucket every hour

486
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,880
and then when we look at the daily

487
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,480
summary sure enough there's that 5 Ines

488
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,520
of rain I'm not sure what might have

489
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,000
fallen on the 30th of September but I

490
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,720
didn't want to try to patch that

491
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,960
together again these tabulate by month

492
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,038
so uh yeah that was significant they

493
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,079
couldn't get out to harvest their fruit

494
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,119
some of that fruit starts to drop and

495
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,319
there's a lot of crop loss associated

496
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,239
with that

497
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,759
so building

498
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,640
capacity what can we do and what have we

499
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,558
been doing to try to build capacity um

500
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,120
as of 2010 we lost all of our funding

501
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:16,319
support for Nua and it

502
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:18,759
was coincidental that a lot of my

503
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,720
colleagues in New England wanted to join

504
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,319
NOA and so it presented with a challenge

505
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,079
and an opportunity at the same time that

506
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,200
we could build this partnership and they

507
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,079
could help fund Nua and sustain it into

508
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,679
the future future our partners including

509
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,158
the northeast regional climate Center

510
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,360
and rainwise Incorporated were also

511
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,559
absolutely essential during that

512
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,519
downturn so the northeast regional

513
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:46,200
climate Center Partners with us they

514
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,278
house the new a climate database they

515
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,000
provide model programming into the pi

516
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:53,240
design tools so the principal

517
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,599
investigator decides what they want this

518
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,720
tool to be and they help the programmer

519
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,558
decide how to program it with the data

520
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
that we have they provide data quality

521
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,879
control meteorological expertise and

522
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,000
guidance and the nice thing is that they

523
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,320
have a high level of interest in

524
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,720
agricultural applications of climate

525
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,240
data as many of you

526
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,960
know they have also helped us create

527
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,839
automated outage reports that go out to

528
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,519
weather station contacts and I have

529
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,599
gotten a lot of emails back initially I

530
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,319
thought oh no they're going to be mad

531
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,879
we're telling them their weather station

532
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,119
is down but for the most part they're

533
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:36,000
really excited about getting that

534
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,918
report this is our slide of Partners and

535
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,679
you know it's a good thing it's starting

536
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,640
to get really crowded so we have two

537
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,720
apple grower associations one in

538
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,080
Minnesota one in North Carolina that

539
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,798
partner with Nua Penn State Rutter

540
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,960
University of Connecticut University of

541
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,278
Massachusetts and University of Vermont

542
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,720
our partners and this year New Hampshire

543
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:02,519
and Virginia Tech have joined

544
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,440
these Partners pay ,750 per year to be

545
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,918
members of Nua that's our subscription

546
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,159
fee rainwise Incorporated has been a

547
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,400
fantastic partner they have helped even

548
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,520
with software programming putting Leaf

549
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,360
wetness sensors onto their stations and

550
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,038
developing their stations so they

551
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,918
actually fit the needs of our Network

552
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,640
and this is a uh just the menu for the

553
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,720
about weather stations and a snapshot of

554
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,038
the weather instrument this is leap

555
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,319
wetness sensor it currently actually is

556
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:37,519
attached over here to the Tipping bucket

557
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:39,720
so that it's facing north at a 45° angle

558
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,000
which it has been shown to be the best

559
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,558
for the

560
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,798
Northeast so this chart is pretty

561
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:52,240
exciting and also a bit

562
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:54,960
daunting so um I became lead in

563
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,240
2005 we launched the current website

564
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,240
that I've shown you in 2009

565
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,919
and the number of instruments in the in

566
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:09,240
the system has just grown significantly

567
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,520
over these last 7 to eight years we now

568
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,038
have 10 Statewide

569
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,639
members and individual farms and

570
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,119
actually it's only five other states

571
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,960
because one of those States is now one

572
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,798
of the 10 Statewide members we ingest

573
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,679
airport data and we've put into place a

574
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:30,119
humidity and correction factor because

575
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,480
obviously the situation in terms of the

576
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,079
microclimate near an airport is quite

577
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,120
different from an agricultural field so

578
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,599
we have a relative humidity correction

579
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,759
factor and we also have a leaf wetness

580
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,918
estimate in place for those stations and

581
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,278
we're partnering with uh the state

582
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,559
climatologist in New Jersey for their

583
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:53,159
data that's this green bar

584
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:54,879
here so pretty exciting in terms of

585
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,880
growth in the number of weather stations

586
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,000
over the last s to eight

587
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,679
years our farmers and multipliers again

588
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,278
we have the individual farms in Illinois

589
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,679
Iowa Maryland Nebraska and

590
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,480
Wisconsin Soil and Water Conservation

591
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,679
districts have written grants to fund

592
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,399
small mesonets we have a a Mesonet

593
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:20,120
funded by them in Sena County in the

594
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,918
wine uh wine grape growing region County

595
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,038
and Regional extension programs have

596
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,000
partnered with us suffk County on Long

597
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,240
Island probably most notable they have

598
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,759
about 20 or more more weather stations

599
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,880
in their Network again primarily on

600
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:39,240
Vineyards but also in on apple farms and

601
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,640
in vegetable potato Fields down there we

602
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,919
have a couple of arboretums and

603
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,159
Wilderness areas obviously the airport

604
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,720
locations and state climatology mezzet

605
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,120
so we're essentially crowdsourcing our

606
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,200
data and pulling it

607
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,278
in the priorities of our stakeholders we

608
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,360
pay pretty close attention to and

609
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,480
obviously sustainable funding for most

610
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:05,240
of us we know how crucial that is um

611
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,880
we'd like to rebuild our website it's

612
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,399
going on 7 years old now and it would be

613
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,679
nice for it to be responsive so whatever

614
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:16,319
size your screen was or your device was

615
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,320
it would adjust for that um we'd love to

616
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,158
have more weather station locations and

617
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,200
one way to do that very quickly would be

618
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,080
to use the national digital forecast

619
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,159
database of grided data and serve up

620
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,879
virtual station locations our end user

621
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,159
users would like apps that reside on

622
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,159
their phone that could interface with

623
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,200
some of our data uh alerts and alarms

624
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,039
for frost uh heat events things like

625
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,000
that and they'd also like for us to be

626
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:45,759
able to cach their biofix

627
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,519
data they want more models and tools

628
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,679
station maintenance and troubleshooting

629
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,558
has been a big uh emphasis of mine in

630
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,759
the last year and a half because of a

631
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,839
funded project um and then I'm here to

632
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,679
promote awareness because so many of

633
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,439
them have been saying Julie you've got

634
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,320
to tell the story you you've got to get

635
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,159
out and tell the story about

636
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:09,038
NOA so in terms of research and

637
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,720
development uh on weather data we

638
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:15,480
developed the leaf wetness estimator

639
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,600
essentially the simplest and least uh

640
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,399
prone to errors on the negative or

641
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,359
positive side was using an hour with

642
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,199
relative humidity above

643
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,519
90% as well as an any hour that would be

644
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,120
raining

645
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,079
obviously um I arano has written and

646
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,918
done research on data quality control

647
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,798
for

648
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,320
precipitation and when he finds that a

649
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:41,398
tipping bucket has either over recorded

650
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,439
or under recorded rain as based on what

651
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,839
the grided data is saying around that

652
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,558
instrument he will send an email out to

653
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,240
them saying hey you know we think

654
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,918
there's something wrong with your uh

655
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,200
tipping bucket rain gauge again we'd

656
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,159
like to build these virtual stations and

657
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,919
if we do we can compare back and forth

658
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:03,200
between the on the data and the virtual

659
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,240
data a really nice fertile ground of

660
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,720
research would be would be developed and

661
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,399
I heard from Abby Sean just um yesterday

662
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,960
or the day before that she and R Deano

663
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:16,000
are going to be looking at that soil

664
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,759
temperature estimate map and comparing

665
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,278
that to sensors actually placed in

666
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:25,599
different soil types across New York so

667
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:28,839
they can see whether there's um an

668
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:31,879
impact of soil type on that

669
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:35,519
it product development we've been

670
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,519
looking at an enua email alert we beta

671
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,319
tested this with apples in 2011 and it's

672
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,440
been running for three years now with

673
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,839
grape Growers they really like this and

674
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,440
we'd like to develop this into a

675
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,079
subscription based product essentially

676
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,000
for any location they choose they can

677
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,879
get the email at a time of their

678
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
choosing and it gives them the results

679
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,559
of the models uh basically in an email

680
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,880
format they don't have to go into the

681
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,359
website and click and click uh to get

682
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,480
the information we've got that degree

683
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,959
date calculator that basically you put

684
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,120
the start date and the end date and

685
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,360
it'll give you the degree day

686
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:14,119
accumulation for that range of dates uh

687
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,119
for that particular location we wrote a

688
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:20,719
grant recently to develop a cache for

689
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:23,599
end user inputs uh first trap catch

690
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,720
dates screen tip dates Blossom dates

691
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,959
things like that but unfortunately it

692
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,480
wasn't funded so that's going to remain

693
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,440
on the drawing board um we also had this

694
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,480
in a grant but this also we did not get

695
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,278
that Grant um but art Deano and the

696
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,240
climate smart farming group are moving

697
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:47,839
forward on this uh piece so that's

698
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,200
exciting and we are still on the drawing

699
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,798
board on our responsive web

700
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,319
design we are currently upping the

701
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,440
vegetable and apple insect tools all the

702
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:01,240
vegetable tools with the 5day for cast

703
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,440
data in the Apple fireblight tool we're

704
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,159
incorporating an epithetic infection

705
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,278
Potential from a third-party software

706
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,639
called Mary blight art Agnello has

707
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,038
written a San Jose scale model for

708
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,839
apples that should go into uh be

709
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:20,158
implemented this year I was doing a

710
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:22,158
workshop with apple Growers and we were

711
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,760
looking at the Apple irrigation model

712
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,760
and it became clear that we've got some

713
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,440
work to do on that model based on some

714
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,558
input from that Workshop

715
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,600
um and we're always open to end user

716
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,879
suggestions for improvements and over

717
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,480
the last six months we've created a list

718
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,919
a wish list of over 40 different models

719
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,599
that are out there in the literature and

720
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,759
the scientific literature that that we

721
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:47,079
could incorporate into this

722
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,759
system so what's the

723
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:52,519
impact NOA is transforming weather

724
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,558
information and knowledge into tools

725
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,599
farmers are being able to share

726
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,079
resources for weather data collection

727
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,480
analysis distribution And archiving

728
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,439
through integration of all these

729
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,798
networks via cloud computing we're

730
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,399
pushing forecasts out 5 days in

731
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:12,398
advance so big deal what's the impact

732
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,079
before we even launched this website

733
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,879
before we even grew to where we are

734
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,398
today we did a survey in 2007 and we

735
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,919
asked growers in New York that were

736
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:25,158
using Nua and these were Apple grape

737
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,038
onion and potato Growers

738
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,278
primarily whether Nua using tools

739
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,679
reduced

740
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:38,638
sprays improved spray timing alerted of

741
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,919
pest risk or enhanced IPM and all of

742
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,439
them virtually all of them agreed or

743
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,320
strongly

744
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,519
agreed sometimes if it's a bad year for

745
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:50,240
diseases you won't get that reduced

746
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,638
spray because if it's rainy and wet all

747
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,798
season long you're going to be chasing

748
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,479
that disease all season

749
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,158
long these same Growers reported on

750
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,519
average that they can save

751
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:09,240
$119,500 per year in spray costs and

752
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:11,839
that was 2007 costs and save 264,000 per

753
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,558
year in crop loss again these are high

754
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,079
value Horticultural

755
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:19,440
crops 99% of end users of Nua at that

756
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,638
time would recommend Nua use to Farmers

757
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,080
and I think that underlines why this has

758
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:28,879
been so popular and why it has grown so

759
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:32,199
much uh in recent years we

760
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,360
now have over 2 million page views per

761
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,679
year in

762
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:40,359
Nua some anecdotes I use the newest site

763
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,399
almost every day early in the season the

764
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,359
orchard was largely scab free for the

765
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,479
first time in several years the manager

766
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,638
depended heavily on Nua and could see

767
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,960
differences between their on-site

768
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:54,599
station and the one they had been using

769
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,079
two New Jersey Growers of apples last

770
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,278
year had the best thinning results ever

771
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:03,798
using our tool so the outcomes are

772
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:06,200
better IPM reduced pesticide use

773
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:08,800
improved Environmental Protection better

774
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,199
crop management improved crop quality

775
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,079
improved yield and definitely enhanced

776
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,158
decision

777
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,839
support so in the

778
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,519
future we've got some new partners and

779
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,599
some new directions to consider we've

780
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,838
just recently embarked on a partnership

781
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,000
with envir weather which is a similar

782
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:32,039
program based at Michigan State Unity

783
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,679
University and I've got a call in to

784
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:37,519
talk this up and see how we can move

785
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,639
forward to collaborate we have models

786
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,440
they want and they have models we want

787
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,679
and could really benefit

788
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,320
from we've been embarking on

789
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,760
conversations with two other state

790
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,519
climatology mesonets North Carolina's

791
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,480
econet and Delaware's Doos I probably

792
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:56,519
killed the pronunciation of that but

793
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,838
deos a New York state mezzet is going in

794
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:01,920
some of you may be aware of this

795
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:04,519
125 weather stations are going in across

796
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,320
New York funded with FEMA dollars in

797
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,400
response to Hurricane

798
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:15,359
Sandy uh tropical storm Irene and I

799
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:17,599
think uh lee uh so we are also

800
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,279
discussing with the the Mesonet on how

801
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,480
we can partner in the future the climate

802
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,079
smart farming group part of the Cornell

803
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,280
Institute for climate change and

804
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,280
agriculture is another area that's rip

805
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,000
for collaboration and we'll be uh

806
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,920
partnering with them and discussing how

807
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,358
to how to move forward and we've also

808
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,280
been discussing how we can partner with

809
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:42,319
ag radar at the University of

810
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,480
Maine again our stakeholder objectives

811
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,960
we keep these closely in mind I've

812
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,880
talked about pretty much all of these um

813
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,400
we've got a newad data product for

814
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,240
thirdparty

815
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,200
software uh called rimo so we just

816
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:00,759
launched that this month so that may

817
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:03,358
bring in some revenue for that product

818
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,440
and I would love to create a developer

819
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:09,838
sandbox so that developers could go in

820
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,079
on the web and plug in their messages

821
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:17,279
dates when those messages should occur

822
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,000
uh base temperatures key risk

823
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,519
Windows uh you know length of wetness

824
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that type of stuff and that model would

825
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:30,440
just essentially autogenerate you'd be

826
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,838
able to Val validate it in research mode

827
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,039
make sure it was working and then

828
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,119
potentially implement it wouldn't that

829
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:37,880
be

830
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,760
nice so the challenges and opportunities

831
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,960
going forward funding funding funding

832
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,520
obviously is Big we know that

833
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,920
Cooperative Extension and land grant

834
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:52,358
universities are losing funding across

835
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,280
the US and that's why our yearly fees

836
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:57,159
have gone down down down we've tried to

837
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,640
keep those as low as we can State

838
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,239
climate tology mezzet are in the same

839
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,639
boat in terms of funding and I'm working

840
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,318
with them to figure out how on our

841
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:10,440
website we can attribute that data to

842
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:13,000
that specific uh State mezzet and I've

843
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,880
got like two or three really good ideas

844
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,280
going forward that I think may work

845
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,200
we're going to have to figure out how do

846
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,640
we blend with existing systems like msus

847
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,639
and viral weather what is the geographic

848
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:28,318
reach of our models and and how do we

849
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,759
validate that it would would be really

850
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:33,480
great to have a model for leaf wetness

851
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,599
Leaf wetness sensors stink they're the

852
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:40,159
bane of plant Pathologists Across the

853
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,079
Nation we can't stand them we need a

854
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,159
really good algorithm for leaf wetness

855
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,039
and there are scientists across the US

856
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,838
and in Canada that have been working on

857
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:52,279
this for for some

858
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,279
time we'd like to obviously utilize the

859
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,000
national digital forecast database and

860
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,920
realtime mesoscale analysis data to do a

861
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,519
better job with precipitation humidity

862
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,440
and leaf wetness in those virtual

863
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,199
locations obviously data quality control

864
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,400
is always a challenge and very

865
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,519
important and we want that website

866
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,160
upgrade and responsive web design the

867
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,119
New York State IPM program is looking to

868
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,799
staff a newa coordinator full-time if we

869
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,920
can get the money to underwrite that

870
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,800
position and we would love to have a

871
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,838
programmer also in the New York State

872
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,318
IPM program to to help us build these

873
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:35,239
various

874
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:37,960
tools so basically Nua is access to IPM

875
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:39,959
decision support providing for the

876
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,838
sustainable management of pests using

877
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,800
methods that minimize environmental

878
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,960
health and economic

879
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,560
risks we use plant disease epidemiology

880
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,838
insect phenology plant phenology and

881
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,838
crop management to generate these

882
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,960
phenology models and forecasts we've got

883
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,318
40 plus tools on our wish list

884
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,119
we want more station locations better

885
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:06,880
end user cach and alarms better quality

886
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,440
control and support and that developer

887
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,119
sandbox would be pretty pretty cool I

888
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,079
think we are doing a really good job in

889
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:18,119
fruits particularly tree fruit and grape

890
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,519
in New York and across the Northeast

891
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,079
we're doing a pretty good job in

892
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,119
vegetables for onions and potatoes we've

893
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,079
got some sweet corn products a cabbage

894
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,800
maggot prod

895
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,560
product we've just put a grant in to

896
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,440
look at uh insect phenology models in

897
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,838
Christmas trees that could spill over

898
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,679
and help the nursery trade in New York

899
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,920
and across the area that that NOA

900
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:44,239
reaches into but we could do a lot

901
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:47,480
better job in field crops and livestock

902
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:49,279
could we do anything with that Don rutz

903
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,760
professor of Veterinary entomology when

904
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,040
he was director of the IPM program said

905
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,119
absolutely Julie of course and I expect

906
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,400
that you're going to do that so Nua

907
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,200
again is open access real time query

908
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,400
based decision support with built-in

909
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:06,679
biof fixes and an interactive

910
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,280
userfriendly

911
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:12,399
interface and with that I'll end and

912
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,760
thank you very much for your attention

913
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,280
today and open it up for any questions

914
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,280
you might

915
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,559
have this has been a production of

916
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:27,559
Cornell University on the web at

917
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,559
