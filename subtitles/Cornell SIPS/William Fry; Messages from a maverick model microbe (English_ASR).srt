1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,780
so my title today is messages from a

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,780
maverick

5
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,649
model microbe and

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,448
what I realized is how much I believe

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,890
you enjoyed my pathology this morning I

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,840
was grateful that I had the opportunity

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,120
to think about this seminar and

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:37,640
lecturing today instead of other things

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,640
and it was about very grateful for that

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,439
obviously the model microbe is

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,989
phytophthora infestans and we know how

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,838
order to say also this photo which I've

15
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:52,048
seen many many many many places without

16
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:54,899
ever any attribution was from Vaughn

17
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:59,039
chains from my lap about 30 35 years ago

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,158
um we know that are tough infestans is a

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,198
model micro because soak in commune and

20
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:09,650
31 and it's very closest friends have

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,649
said so it says so in this publication

22
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,849
sage advice Ellen I don't think so

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,290
that's not what actually you and I would

24
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,140
just say some of the reasons why I

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,390
cannot

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,939
first of all

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,849
I'm an introvert and

28
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:33,239
for those of you who are introverts

29
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:36,390
moves an introvert yeah okay so we don't

30
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,719
even buy so easily it's really hard and

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,719
you heard

32
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,969
finish finish finish

33
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:57,320
yes

34
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:00,189
absolutely crazy what's up I'll be

35
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:04,209
talking like this oh

36
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:08,270
and also you know my career

37
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:10,639
really did not have a special plan it

38
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,370
just sort of happened so i have to say i

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,529
have had no special career goals so

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,640
there's nothing I can say that would

41
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,960
provide any miracles to anybody

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,709
but I have wanted to do is be a

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,540
professor in a small University I got

44
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:30,469
the professor part right never quite

45
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:33,229
made a small University and life I think

46
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,479
some of you my first years in the in

47
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:37,429
graduate school were sort of tough I

48
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,539
wasn't sure that I shouldn't be in

49
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,540
technology and it was interesting to to

50
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:46,909
go through that experience

51
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:49,329
and I suspect that I'm not alone in that

52
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:52,250
and I think that that's

53
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,380
okay I have subsequently come to this

54
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,060
absolutely

55
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:58,669
really enjoy the subject is I find it

56
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,830
just really really exciting and really

57
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:03,919
lot of fun

58
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:06,190
so I have messages from five top 35

59
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,299
states and three categories and

60
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,400
since i'm not giving advice what i'm

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,920
going to do is sort of relate some

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,219
things that I've learned during the last

63
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,069
several years

64
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:20,629
in these categories first love

65
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,599
epidemiology and population genetics of

66
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:27,650
phytophthora infestans

67
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:29,229
short segment on humanity and a short

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,319
section on host-pathogen interactions

69
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:34,738
for I think I'm going to illustrate sort

70
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,628
of the Maverick qualities of this

71
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,128
organism

72
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:41,938
but I need to provide some context for

73
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:41,938
all of this and

74
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,489
this is me as a diligent graduate

75
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:50,408
student

76
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,420
some years ago and you're probably all

77
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:53,699
thinking that I'm just looking but I'm

78
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,199
thinking very hard

79
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,738
disappoint notice also that I do have

80
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,179
brown hair at that's

81
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,480
be probably thinking that maybe I was

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,400
thinking about

83
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,669
phytophthora infestans

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,439
but actually that's not true

85
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:14,768
when I was in graduate school I was

86
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,788
essentially a lab rat I which the Queen

87
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,280
house once a year and I never got to the

88
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:22,719
field and

89
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,388
my thesis action was really very

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,910
interesting i discovered a new enzyme

91
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,370
that

92
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,610
was typical of pathogens of silence any

93
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,139
plans some plants produce

94
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,680
cyanogenic glycosides a new brightest to

95
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,889
HCM on infection ACN is running quite

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,810
toxic and

97
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:46,658
but it turns out that many pathogens of

98
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,098
these plants produce an enzyme that

99
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:53,088
converts how to cyanide too far behind

100
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:56,240
and I was really was really proud of

101
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:56,240
that accomplishment

102
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:01,668
but I but there's another message here

103
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:04,490
in this one and that is

104
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:08,538
that your audience really matters

105
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:12,538
it turns out the audience for cyanogenic

106
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:14,098
work in plants and very small as well as

107
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:19,278
stated here my first phytopathology

108
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:19,278
paper on xen that must be 19

109
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,968
okay

110
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:25,158
cyanide tolerant since I'm feeling low

111
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:30,418
tide

112
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:32,490
since 1971 has had 15 of citations my

113
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,788
first paper on Fatah confessed ends of

114
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,538
1975 and

115
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:41,938
7 950 which is interesting three or four

116
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,778
and last six months which is also the

117
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:47,370
most impressive paper

118
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:49,788
certainly with HD and I published was in

119
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,310
archives and falconers from of physics

120
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:55,949
and it's had my

121
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,930
citations again nothing the past three

122
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,908
or four months

123
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,939
my most highly cited paper on fight off

124
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:05,158
infestans is this one in 1994 but we

125
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:08,759
just started a global distribution of a

126
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:11,188
single from a lineage in campus with 437

127
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,620
citations and 20 in the last seven

128
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,620
points which is different so the message

129
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,538
here that there was an audience for my

130
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,569
pudding excellent working sun identity

131
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,829
but there was an audience for work on my

132
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,629
top ten pheasants I have to say this

133
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:30,969
paper yeah I know demonstration

134
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:34,120
the obvious then yet was it was

135
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,120
picked up by

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,440
ok so I was hired and saw this picture

137
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,579
for was hired to

138
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,079
teach Disease Control and you

139
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:46,879
appropriate research and with my

140
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,259
background in the plant physiology and

141
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,009
biochemistry that seemed like his

142
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:54,670
stretch and it was I really know put in

143
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:58,279
the world I would be going to do

144
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:01,090
so I thought long and hard about it it

145
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,479
has started the

146
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:07,479
position was actually here and

147
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,710
what I decided to do was too focused on

148
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:16,210
late blood for a variety of reasons

149
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:16,209
first of all it was a model for

150
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,189
secondly it was important in New York

151
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,839
State

152
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:26,209
it was possible to me to do field

153
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,649
experiments and there was expertise in

154
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,649
department warrant credit

155
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,259
when credit digs Thurston who was

156
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,230
remarkably generous with

157
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,930
advice and help

158
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,069
during the early stages and

159
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,720
he had been working with phytother

160
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,420
Festus but required some time I thought

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,310
he was old at that time

162
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,480
but he was pretty very helpful so that

163
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:55,670
was the reason I chose it all right some

164
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,180
epidemiology and population genetics

165
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,530
studies when i first started work at

166
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,509
secret do you think that i would really

167
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:07,529
have to do some few experiments

168
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:10,980
management my first field experiment

169
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,379
occurred in 1917 tubes a total boss

170
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,920
we've got drowned out from Hurricane

171
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,719
Agnes our second field experiment was of

172
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,300
a lunar month later in the same year

173
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,970
there was absolutely no disease and I

174
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,150
realized that this is not easy as

175
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:30,180
packaging in the world to work with

176
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:32,490
subsequently moved to frito and did

177
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,769
learn how to do field experiments with

178
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,889
white tough investments this is narrow

179
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:40,579
photo of those plots and it's a false

180
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,080
color infrared photo and

181
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,139
the healthy tissue looks bright red

182
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,960
diseased tissue gray or in soil sort of

183
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:51,059
three so there were really significant

184
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,860
differences in these and listen buddy

185
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,039
actually found an interesting to do

186
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,039
these kinds of experiments because

187
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:02,879
there were almost analogous to doing

188
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:05,329
enzyme assays just how many people have

189
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,309
ever done enzyme assays artistic a

190
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:12,000
couple of us old folks right and we

191
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:14,609
that anymore but I did and the

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,490
kinetics were very interesting and aziz

193
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,810
development is one of these plots had

194
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,060
kinetics that work in use and there's

195
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,889
really good really develop over time in

196
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:29,279
kinetics were really quite important

197
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:31,740
so what we knew about the epidemiology

198
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,839
of phytophthora des des was really quite

199
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,120
a lot and

200
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Jack Brown in 1981 published a paper

201
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,659
describing a simulation model

202
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,450
cartoon of it you listed here and clean

203
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:48,159
enough to put this too

204
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,740
after it which was a really interesting

205
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,199
accomplished a person to run this model

206
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,759
took hours and hours

207
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,879
actually first time we get up is on

208
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,110
punch card to the mainframe

209
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,519
but we use in two experiments over the

210
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,649
weekend and come back and we have a

211
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,509
simulation experiment to do the same

212
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,110
experiment today takes less than a

213
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,110
second and

214
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,530
Jorge entrada

215
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:16,660
refine the model in 2005 and illustrated

216
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:19,769
that really works pretty well in these

217
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:22,990
various epidemics the

218
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:25,590
observations are in the open circles and

219
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,149
the prediction is in the straight

220
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,490
continuous line and you can see that the

221
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:33,370
prediction fits the observation pretty

222
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,560
nicely in most of these and that model

223
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,649
has been the basis for decision support

224
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,809
system that we've subsequently produced

225
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:45,129
students this paper by in small from

226
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:47,979
last year in which we named and use the

227
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:50,129
white pro decision support system and

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,800
that's really kind of cool

229
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,389
it involves host resistance

230
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,849
password future whether such a side a

231
00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:00,069
pathogen strain and pathogen proximity

232
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,230
all together in helping growers make

233
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,810
management decisions and what's really

234
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,230
important i think is that all this is

235
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:11,009
done in absentia so it's it's a it's a

236
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,129
very nice tool

237
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,379
what we didn't know at that time

238
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:21,200
was what caused

239
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:25,080
unexpected disease control and

240
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,610
we wondered about whether the University

241
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,149
of the pathogen population might

242
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:34,169
contribute to that and

243
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:36,089
so we began the question looking at

244
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:40,338
population genetics and photos and

245
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:44,940
festivals and when we started this

246
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:48,300
we knew that there were a 2 and a 1 many

247
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,580
types in Mexico what topic of Stanton's

248
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,549
head without so there are too many times

249
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,410
he wanted nature and

250
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:58,189
only a one mating types had been found

251
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:01,049
from the rest of the world

252
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,089
so two people coming to lab would

253
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,829
already had wonderful tools totally

254
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,170
brought allozyme stir that followed by

255
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,750
Steve good one who developed here rflp

256
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:12,269
fingerprint for DNA fingerprinting I

257
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,129
slits prior to this time the only

258
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,769
markers that were available for mating

259
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:18,659
type and morphology no diversity in

260
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,669
mythology so we only had meeting type

261
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,169
essentially single market and that

262
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:24,649
because you just been joking about

263
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:29,569
populations of plant pathogens from that

264
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:31,439
these these two games a

265
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,750
possibility of looking at population

266
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,709
structure and disorganization in other

267
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,740
locations so we so requested Isis from

268
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:43,338
people around the world some

269
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:47,789
culture collections and

270
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,709
analyze those isolates using both

271
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:53,990
markets and we felt like Paul Dooley and

272
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:57,449
markers developed by Steve good way

273
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,659
in Mexico what we learned is that indeed

274
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:05,300
the a1 and a2 mating types were present

275
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:07,818
proportions when we applied the dusties

276
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:09,740
do they think creativity's what we

277
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:12,438
learned is that the population of rivers

278
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,110
and with this slide illustrates these

279
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:16,958
these numbers real estate those three

280
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,329
individual

281
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,998
individuals the DNA is in this lady's

282
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:24,679
cup with restriction fragment

283
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:28,699
restriction enzyme and then probe with

284
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:31,338
our fee 57 and what you'll see is that

285
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:34,849
these individual states are really quite

286
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:38,680
different from each other which is

287
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:42,550
consistent with this being a sexual

288
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,549
population in central Mexico

289
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:48,489
what we learned from everywhere else was

290
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:51,350
something we need to management and

291
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,568
so does affirming US Canada Peru Ecuador

292
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,528
Colombia the UK Netherlands going to

293
00:13:53,568 --> 00:14:00,349
pantalon Philippines can under wanted

294
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:03,698
all had the same paper which was a

295
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:06,939
really interesting with occupation

296
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:09,919
we termed this

297
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:11,568
photo lineage the US 1 formal image if

298
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,729
you saw it first in the US and s are

299
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:16,759
everywhere else it's all it would maybe

300
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,360
type in one type of mitochondrial DNA of

301
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:23,180
the Allison's lurkin 112 had the same

302
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,818
DNA fingerprint and as always pop out

303
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:27,799
pretty to this paper doll talk about the

304
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,838
panworld with mr. grade distribution of

305
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,769
a single

306
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,000
linning to flip out that residents

307
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:37,269
how can you explain that kind of

308
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,429
situation

309
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:43,309
nobody can explain it for sure but one

310
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:46,250
possibility is that this organism went

311
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:49,250
through a severe bottleneck and when

312
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:52,429
somehow to northwest europe in northwest

313
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,649
europe there's a very vibrant seed

314
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:56,329
particular trait or secret a toner sold

315
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,659
all over the world to South America

316
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,570
Africa Asia and

317
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:05,629
this organism most very happily

318
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:08,360
tubers another possibility is that it

319
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:10,129
came first to the United States and in

320
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,779
fact make life appeared in the United

321
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,100
States before it appeared in Europe and

322
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,319
then maybe from the United States it

323
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,940
went to Europe and then subsequently was

324
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,540
distributed throughout the rest of the

325
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,400
world so those are some possibilities

326
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:26,079
but we continue collecting knife slips

327
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,459
from people around the world and

328
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,150
linda Spielman made a really interesting

329
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,150
discovery

330
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,139
she said look there's something else

331
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,880
happening in these locations around the

332
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:43,159
world and so sure enough there was

333
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,960
and what we suggested is that there was

334
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,589
a second worldwide migration and

335
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,940
population

336
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,910
this is some of the most exciting work

337
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,270
that ever been associated probably some

338
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:57,639
of the most important i wrote a

339
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,319
spectacular proposal to the best

340
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:01,909
traction

341
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,129
which is really interesting so it seems

342
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:07,338
like some of the most important and most

343
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,980
interesting projects to still make it so

344
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,589
that the

345
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,930
reviewers where he didn't like it

346
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:17,740
and they didn't believe that this could

347
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:22,269
be happening but in fact it did

348
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:25,430
it made the news in the early 1990s

349
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:27,159
there is an article from New York Times

350
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,509
and

351
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,778
this is what actually happened in the

352
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:36,620
1970s us one was disputed essentially

353
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:38,539
all around the world by 1997 those

354
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,669
populations have been replaced you can't

355
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,669
find it anymore locations can find that

356
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:46,459
particular video it's been replaced by a

357
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,759
different population of veterans which

358
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,629
is highly diverse in those locations and

359
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,389
actually there's sexual reproduction

360
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:55,629
occurring in in the Scandinavian

361
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:58,699
countries and

362
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:01,778
we do know how that happened there was a

363
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:06,529
shipment of potatoes from

364
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:07,959
Mexico after the 1976 season because in

365
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:11,558
New York there had been a drought in the

366
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,939
1976's a very short potato crop and

367
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:17,838
Europeans desire to allow Mexican

368
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:20,800
potatoes into Europe so that we use

369
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,799
exclusively for

370
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:28,569
you can't forget people who buy potatoes

371
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:31,299
store from planting and I'm sure that's

372
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,029
what happened and that's what brought in

373
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:37,649
these novel strains if I talk they're

374
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,649
testing and then they were

375
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:45,490
substrate from

376
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:49,180
northwestern Europe and it happened

377
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,839
really fast he didn't have Isis in the

378
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:55,120
Netherlands Germany and Poland we could

379
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:58,209
cut the deck and we can demonstrate that

380
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,049
this there was this introduction of the

381
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:06,150
new strings and they displaced

382
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:09,819
the old spines that had been and so this

383
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,160
message I guess is that with this

384
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,569
organism

385
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,009
vibration and population displacement

386
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:17,009
are really cute

387
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,759
and it didn't happen only in Europe it

388
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:24,179
also happened in the States here's an

389
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,879
example that is particularly

390
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,430
impressive to me and this concerns a

391
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,660
lineage that we've called the u.s. 800m

392
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:37,350
lineage we detected it in 1992 and watch

393
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,350
new computer

394
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,798
season at the invite season we had a

395
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,210
sample from Maine which also had that

396
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,369
which gives him astray before because

397
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,909
we've sampled from Northwest Mexico and

398
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:54,189
found this exactly

399
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:58,350
president in a Northwest Mexico and then

400
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:02,710
in 1994 you covered the entire

401
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:05,949
eastern part of the US and by 1995 could

402
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,890
colonize all of the western part of the

403
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,409
u.s.

404
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,528
so one of the things that we've done is

405
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:17,799
to look at the population structure over

406
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:20,950
time and this slide prepared by Giovanni

407
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:24,690
Johnny's illustrates that us eight was

408
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:29,048
the dominant strain from 1997 to 2008

409
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:31,990
replaced in 2009 by us 22 now they just

410
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:34,740
wondered throughout that and then you

411
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:39,700
can see that after

412
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:42,308
2010 that US 23 has become the dominant

413
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,298
strain and this turns out to be really

414
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:47,859
difficult for fight often festivals is

415
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:50,859
that there are these waves of

416
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:53,308
predominance and disappearance and it's

417
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:56,769
not is to not only in

418
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:59,319
the US but also in Europe and these are

419
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,990
data from people who illustrates that

420
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,629
the

421
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:08,769
u.s. one strains present 1982 were gone

422
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,720
by 1995 and then these a one stranger

423
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:13,778
present until about two thousand five

424
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,350
and starting in 2005 there was dominance

425
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:21,308
by destroyed here which of blue 13 or 13

426
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:24,308
a2 and that

427
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:24,308
and

428
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:31,418
so the take-home message concerning

429
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:35,898
epidemiology and population turns to me

430
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:38,269
is that all non Mexicans Mexican

431
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:40,778
phytophthora infestans populations are

432
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:44,388
recently derived from outside

433
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:47,419
this organs we just goes in lots of

434
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:49,209
places I've seen reports where people

435
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:52,009
have suggested that we have an Irish

436
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,240
stringing a fight off Manchester what

437
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:55,128
they don't say so we've been there for

438
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,278
10 years and prior to that it was in

439
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:59,689
Mexico would you say there's no way that

440
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:01,159
there is such a thing as an Irish

441
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,320
straight there's no way that there's

442
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:07,090
such a thing as the US as a nuestra

443
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,089
they're all recently arrived from

444
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:17,330
okay

445
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:17,329
so my next topic is about humanity

446
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,869
I took this picture in early August

447
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:31,279
[Music]

448
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:33,099
1994 and this is a potato form and this

449
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,569
is a potato field and

450
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,059
its ground because it was destroyed by

451
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:40,369
that light and

452
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:42,159
this is a sprayer right here in that car

453
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,989
engine spray two or three times a week

454
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,790
to

455
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,029
suppress lately so I talked on the

456
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,029
grower

457
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,399
this is always difficult to say

458
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:09,239
about where you could

459
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,308
and he said every Thursday night the

460
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,730
growers in this county pitfield in

461
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,730
Crimea

462
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:31,440
and that's because I think we're other

463
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:34,428
customers i think this strain would you

464
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,429
just relax all

465
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:44,309
spin dramatically more aggressive

466
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:48,319
you just wrote on a customer

467
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:51,480
so that was Sir my first

468
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:55,369
introduction to the damage and human

469
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,370
impact that this disease

470
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,120
it's a picture of Irish happened he was

471
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:09,490
a blower in Madison County

472
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,889
and in nineteen metaphor he lost his

473
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,140
problems

474
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:19,410
these are dead he said illustrating but

475
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:22,690
late blight 1990 94 in 1995

476
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,900
bankruptcy and a clean nurse later he

477
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,900
died

478
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:41,658
we 2009 of similar story having this

479
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:44,269
really fascinating Kevin Myers in my

480
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:47,210
life took this picture at our local

481
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:49,308
Lowe's to this picture and gene 23rd

482
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,919
these are explained of transfers to be

483
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:55,509
sold to local garters and they are

484
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,489
infected with Python third persons and

485
00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:01,639
what happened was what happened not only

486
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:05,269
in our Louis but New Jersey and

487
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:08,168
Pennsylvania in Connecticut in Maine all

488
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,169
throughout the Northeast

489
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,679
and a visit to this organic farm I think

490
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,469
forget of july in

491
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,849
2009 and this was the lat plenty of

492
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:22,159
tomatoes and they would be deterred by

493
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:23,439
the lake life as well and i received

494
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:29,089
this letter

495
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,219
which i think Bob's me I am an organic

496
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:33,138
gardener in Amsterdam New York with 63

497
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,960
heirloom tomato plants and 23 different

498
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:38,988
varieties they're all gone I was growing

499
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,940
very rare varieties blacks being oranges

500
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:44,088
whites I'll purchase from a very

501
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,038
reputable brands of Harry can I have

502
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:48,888
believed home as my husband pulling that

503
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:52,308
you all 63 plants I have a her percent

504
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:53,868
loss we know on 10 acres I inspected

505
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:56,710
every day and it seems the black took my

506
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:59,238
defense in a matter of hours

507
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:03,190
I was hoping to sell them for additional

508
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:06,619
people so on this

509
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,919
as I chose late blight to work on as an

510
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:08,918
academic

511
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,750
convenient system to use I've heard

512
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,059
about all this snow from the Irish

513
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,079
potato famine at all but to experience

514
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:20,819
is really really quite significant and

515
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:24,569
this side was given to me by san jo

516
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:28,579
Illinois it was an example of a 2014

517
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:32,579
lake in west bengal in india and

518
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:34,230
what happened there was that in 2013

519
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,449
Melvin's significant overproduction at

520
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,480
mid to low prices and centaurs could not

521
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:41,220
be the motorcade in 2014 there was a

522
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,920
devastating Lakeland epidemic caused by

523
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,529
13

524
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:48,750
in Europe

525
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:51,869
there were term Eliza's economic and

526
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,000
social amend farmer suicides and then

527
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:57,959
some toys particularly disappointed that

528
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,690
the government or he is limited exports

529
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,460
to other places because that sort of

530
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,279
distorted future markets for the growers

531
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,740
of our communities

532
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:11,569
so my lesson that I've taken from this

533
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,569
one is that light line

534
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,970
okay next on to host-pathogen

535
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:21,000
interactions is my third topic

536
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,920
message and

537
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,380
label this one of the fryer lab failures

538
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,529
and

539
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:32,170
is their failures because

540
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:34,440
we've been unable to see phenotypes that

541
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,480
other folks see

542
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,779
the first one concerns on purified

543
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,829
Osment in which according to the pnas

544
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,829
article confer resistance

545
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:50,529
so we've received the

546
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,450
developers of is we're happy to send us

547
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,789
transgenic potatoes that were expressed

548
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,440
in PR card

549
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:58,049
we put them in the field this is an

550
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,920
experiment where we had different

551
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:05,950
potatoes genotypes and

552
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:09,009
unfortunately the plants with pr5 we're

553
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,819
not at all resistant just completely not

554
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:15,849
so that's you know we just could not

555
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:17,308
achieve the same result that the folks

556
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:22,289
at Purdue energy

557
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:26,759
and then a year to later conversation

558
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:30,690
colleague in Europe and she said I've

559
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:33,259
created resistance to lately I said wow

560
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:37,289
that's great

561
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:39,420
the company and they were going to

562
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:42,149
create transgenic potatoes that were

563
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:46,170
resistant to late life and unfortunately

564
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:51,570
were able to do a test which confirmed

565
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:55,140
that experiment and this is a picture of

566
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:57,059
that field experiment there's some

567
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,900
people to know who were part of that

568
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,950
experiment and remember it well

569
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,420
and by this time I've learned how to

570
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:08,009
kill plants inflate boy and

571
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,200
although the company would never come

572
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:12,089
across or convinced that what happened

573
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,490
the concert had a pathogen specific

574
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:16,949
promoter

575
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:21,150
with an arching and a navy argue so that

576
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:23,610
upon our NOC ulation of leave with quite

577
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,950
often pest hands we make hypersensitive

578
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:26,729
response and

579
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:30,930
resistance and I think that's what they

580
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:33,269
saw in their experiments of Europe so

581
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,750
this is a just after we had an

582
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:41,179
occupation and this is what we saw after

583
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:44,210
the progressive turns out there was

584
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:46,480
indeed diversity in the transgenders

585
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:50,769
someone more resistant somewhere less

586
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,769
there is nothing associated

587
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:56,329
that was diversity so one of the things

588
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:58,548
I really don't think this is that if you

589
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:00,639
put potatoes to a palace reduce the

590
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:06,250
laughter's summer funk very much and

591
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,250
that explains the person that you'll see

592
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:13,030
the question is why why do some people

593
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:13,029
see these

594
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:20,089
these phenotypes that week and

595
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,640
I wanted that for some years and then

596
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:26,359
just in the last couple of years I think

597
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,640
I think I actually know and I think the

598
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,428
answer is at sporangia from a culture

599
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,460
are not the same as spread year from

600
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,259
leading colleges and people inoculate

601
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,048
the growth chamber with Sturridge of the

602
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:41,048
culture an epidemic in the field

603
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,630
so

604
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:51,400
the reason I think I know this

605
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,520
comes in part with work from

606
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:58,630
headquarters in routine

607
00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:01,650
water was this his approach was to his

608
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,900
goal was to look at how sensitive my

609
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,259
toughest had spread to our to solar

610
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:10,720
radiation and

611
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:13,180
you he had a terrible time he was one of

612
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,910
her happy register for the summer

613
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:18,700
because every time he did this

614
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,730
experiment you take the spreadsheet from

615
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,950
culturing expose them to someone

616
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,089
absolutely no surprise

617
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,799
finally a desperation when he didn't

618
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,589
have a culture available he took some

619
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,409
spreading from the leaf and long before

620
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:34,359
they didn't

621
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,430
copy conditions 87 survived for hours

622
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:38,859
mm-hmm under sunny conditions which is

623
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,500
illustrated here most of their dead

624
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:45,869
within 60 minutes but they survived 15

625
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:48,819
minutes installation so clearly

626
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:51,459
the sporangia from this culture army

627
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:53,950
which don't survive at all spend you

628
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,829
from the juicer god they're pretty

629
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,330
different from each other

630
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:01,449
they work with then closing we had

631
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:04,119
another insight into this dan was

632
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,130
working on arachidonic acid and where he

633
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:07,750
demonstrated that in fact retreat plans

634
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,220
of arachidonic acid to become more

635
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,069
resistant to phytophthora infestans

636
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:16,089
which is just great and here's an image

637
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:18,429
of that here is a leaflet that did not

638
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:21,099
have our economic acid applied to it and

639
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:24,090
you can see nice lesion here's a leaflet

640
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:28,929
that did have our epidemic acid and the

641
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:30,918
is a very small regional population but

642
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,288
we tried to repeat that experiment and

643
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,119
the same

644
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:37,638
and then I realize the reason we didn't

645
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:39,249
get that phenotype is that we were

646
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:42,158
taking our

647
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:44,298
spray get from papers and

648
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,259
inoculate so if you take a scrounging

649
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:49,548
from a leaflet and you put it on to

650
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:51,200
plants treated either treat not treated

651
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:54,668
with arachidonic acid or treated with

652
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,669
our economic acid um

653
00:31:55,538 --> 00:32:04,480
again it's this exact same pathogen one

654
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:04,480
comes from leaf the other comes from

655
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:10,220
so one of the questions that Shawn

656
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,788
parties was asking is is there an

657
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,798
effective dist pathogenicity and

658
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:18,528
he did a field experiment in which he

659
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:20,079
took sprang from the culture two

660
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:22,720
different isolates and

661
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:26,148
inoculated plants in the field and

662
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,118
leaflets in moisture and you can see

663
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:30,108
that he did get disease

664
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:34,038
different amounts of disease from the

665
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:35,918
two isolates if he took sporangia from a

666
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:39,798
leaflet

667
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,109
both in the field pots for both isolates

668
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:46,028
you've got a lot more disease the same

669
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:49,638
numbers branch then he did

670
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:52,308
if the ISIS came from culture and that's

671
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:54,699
particularly true with the disease on

672
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:54,700
leafless

673
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:02,308
in moisture

674
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:04,899
so our goal is to try to understand what

675
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:08,979
what is happening and one approach is to

676
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:10,569
use our NAC to determine first of all if

677
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:12,069
this branch are different from each

678
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:15,329
other and secondly to see what's

679
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:18,759
happening during the infection process

680
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:21,278
those materials are still at while

681
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:23,819
they're going to come back we don't have

682
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:27,638
them yet so in

683
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:31,358
lieu of having the RNA seek data Sean

684
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:34,838
did some one day in real time pcr and

685
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:38,168
what we know is that infamous elicited

686
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:40,239
by talking to us today that's a protein

687
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:41,940
if you put it into tobacco it's a

688
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:45,690
hypersensitive response

689
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,690
we know that that

690
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,450
smoothie indeed elicited is

691
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:53,668
downregulated in

692
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:57,429
Infante oh

693
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:59,409
there is an RX lr that which is an

694
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:01,028
effector from photographer investor from

695
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:02,669
previous studies we knew that one to be

696
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:06,308
upregulated in

697
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:09,778
in tissue and so what we did was to

698
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:13,628
compare the expression of these two

699
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:17,429
genes in spreads that came from the

700
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:21,460
leaves or from culture and what we found

701
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:23,818
was that from culture info on which

702
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,940
causes hundred

703
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:30,809
the are XLR which is an effector

704
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:34,809
was definitely so what Ron did was to

705
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:36,730
look at the ratio of inform the

706
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:40,628
expression of if one to the expression

707
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:43,019
of our XLR between spreads that came

708
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:46,628
from culture or sprint to the king from

709
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:48,878
leaflets and what he found is that for

710
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:50,529
these two isolates there's about a more

711
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:54,578
than a 50-fold difference in expression

712
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:56,500
of those teachers and our suspect that

713
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:59,019
that difference in expression can cause

714
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,760
a different phenotype if you're using a

715
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,759
strange infant culture person system

716
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:13,440
so the pathogen clearly is different

717
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,670
what about the host but that is in

718
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,980
different environments and it turns out

719
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,980
i think that the host also be different

720
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,570
we did this experiment

721
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,809
last year right now

722
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:33,099
2000 one or two thousand or two dozen

723
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:35,019
three something like that and chris was

724
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,549
heavily involved in this one we were

725
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:37,980
looking at the differences in resistor

726
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:42,130
between two

727
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:44,920
closely related tomato compressions but

728
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:47,940
we did find a QTL for resistance and

729
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,420
what was wrong about this

730
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,320
he's at first of all we could get fairly

731
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,170
expression and without a whole lot of

732
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,740
noise which mr. interested we used micro

733
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,420
thomas is old technology that

734
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:03,029
but one of the most interesting to me

735
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,400
discoveries

736
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:09,150
for plants that were not inoculated just

737
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:16,619
growing together what we found was that

738
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:16,619
the top 34 of the top 200 most variable

739
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,360
we're all defensively

740
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:27,230
and what I'm wondering is are they in

741
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,318
fact divest really are they just are

742
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,639
they just perturbation

743
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,969
in destroying in the field over here

744
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:37,909
exposed to all kinds of things and

745
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:40,129
the top six included catalase which is

746
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:42,009
the first one and then five PR team

747
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:46,068
concluded the most

748
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:47,740
variable strains of arabic genes in this

749
00:36:46,068 --> 00:36:51,440
experiment

750
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:57,098
we also found a significant differential

751
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,099
expression of genes in the two different

752
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:03,949
two different genotypes of planets and

753
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:05,269
we found that we were able to science to

754
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:08,989
of about thirty two they were

755
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:10,159
upregulated in il-62 but not i may need

756
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:13,879
to get maybe two of us and more

757
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:17,469
susceptible when we silenced those two

758
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:21,380
it reduce the resistance in il-6 to

759
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:23,989
the conclusion i come to is that field

760
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,750
expertise of field studies of gene

761
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:28,308
expression are entirely possible and

762
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,588
there's not a huge amount of noise you

763
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:31,849
don't have to

764
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:32,739
always get a huge amount of very sore

765
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,119
throat

766
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:36,858
and i'm just going to suggest that if we

767
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,450
really are interested in post per second

768
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:40,639
version that's happening sort of a field

769
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:43,449
that is a whole lot more efficient to do

770
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,449
this kind of experiment

771
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:50,929
so the third message I have concerning

772
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,619
post-crescent interactions is that may

773
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:55,868
be at least r500 distance and its host

774
00:37:53,619 --> 00:38:00,130
the

775
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:00,130
interaction can be specific

776
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,329
so finally

777
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,578
the three messages to me are there is no

778
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,559
such thing except in Supreme Mexico the

779
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,989
native

780
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,900
african fest and

781
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:20,210
late blight can be absolutely true and

782
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,880
we also get with it can be specific to

783
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:26,720
the environment

784
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,960
now this is a maverick micro I'm on my

785
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:33,518
good friend Cindy McNabb

786
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,519
developed this Limerick

787
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:39,498
phytophthora infestans is freaking

788
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:41,869
prototypical also quite speaking its

789
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:44,798
maverick waves cause eyebrows to raise

790
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:47,778
in theories turn porous and linking

791
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:50,268
sometimes it textbook quintessential

792
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:52,730
exemplary so elemental that's when it

793
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:54,548
conforms to microbial norms a model

794
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,019
that's quite providential

795
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:58,940
sometimes it's in freakin weird a

796
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:01,058
renegade has reappeared starts breaking

797
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,119
rules making us look like fools

798
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:07,339
conclusive results disappear this model

799
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,548
that's this micro that's model and

800
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:13,308
maverick exemplary and enigmatic we must

801
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:16,630
understand learned by both and eccentric

802
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:19,620
yet paradigm

803
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,970
so I'd like to thank you also to

804
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:24,029
recognize this group of people through

805
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:27,629
my work I

806
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:30,730
don't have pictures of everybody

807
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:34,470
this time but i would like to Lisa

808
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:38,010
Christmas in the audience now

809
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:38,009
over there oh

810
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:44,320
if I'd my wife Barbara is here she works

811
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:47,260
in the lab and has been a big partner so

812
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,750
I think with that homeless and there's

813
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,050
already questions of being happy to try

814
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,050
to dust

815
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:01,019
[Applause]

816
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:06,030
so you found that things like sporangia

817
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:06,030
or resistance or variable

818
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,409
parameters

819
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,849
uh

820
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,650
that's I think the matching the model

821
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:22,080
does need to be recalibrated what we

822
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,410
learned is that different isolates have

823
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,509
different parameters

824
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:28,579
most models are constructed on the US

825
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,099
for money

826
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:34,199
the

827
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:37,070
capability of those models is very not

828
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:40,559
known at this point to

829
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:42,599
how useful they are I think what we saw

830
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,900
was sort of a qualitative difference in

831
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:49,500
terms of

832
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,500
in terms of the

833
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:56,700
field versus the

834
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:59,429
greenhouse type of direction but this

835
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,980
problems intestinal exclusively or not

836
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:05,299
specific a lot in the field so I think

837
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,300
that has helped us a lot

838
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,900
so your take-home message number one is

839
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,210
that all the isolates that we know of

840
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,889
today came from Mexico if they're all

841
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,490
moving about we're giving these new

842
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:18,989
epidemics with new genotypes presumably

843
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:20,719
you get different mating types that move

844
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:23,429
out and then you could get

845
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,689
geographically specific isil's right

846
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:26,429
when do you think that's you think it's

847
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,519
already happening yeah it's happening

848
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:31,739
there's um there's a sexual population

849
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,679
in Scandinavian countries and probably

850
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,569
poland i still need Olivia western

851
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,980
Russia

852
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,809
and whether that will develop into

853
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,690
something dramatically different all

854
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:44,150
right ah in many places it's still

855
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:46,710
hiding from

856
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,380
traumatic apologists like it is in the

857
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,240
United States the all of Africans that

858
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,960
way

859
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:57,859
India Asia are that way

860
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,590
South America is that way

861
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,180
so there's there's its initiative

862
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,230
actually I mean there is sexual

863
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:07,329
reproduction in that part of the world

864
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:11,679
including the step

865
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:13,969
but most other locations have

866
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,549
clonal lineages and someone said the

867
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:18,259
same one like this blue 13 which is

868
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,810
found in Europe is now dominant in China

869
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,420
and

870
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:27,070
so just as the follow-up to that so for

871
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,559
places where the populations are clonal

872
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:31,210
quarantine issues seem to be

873
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,349
key

874
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,570
you're not going to get a diverse

875
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:38,000
population there unless you unless you

876
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:40,480
allow entry of new isolates right right

877
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,619
but this pathogen

878
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,199
travels on potatoes around the world and

879
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:48,529
it travels in the air as well so I think

880
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:51,099
there will be there is migration quite

881
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,100
quite

882
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,670
sexual

883
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:13,509
so I'm in actual potatoes were not

884
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:16,420
ground commercially and potatoes until

885
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:20,190
the nineteen existence prior to that

886
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,420
time it was on wild species but now

887
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:26,010
there's a hell of a lot of time decided

888
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,010
to use one commercial potatoes

889
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,150
so

890
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,980
stint little in tune with the value some

891
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,710
actually doesn't because of such a

892
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,630
diverse population it doesn't to look at

893
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:42,579
any single

894
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,970
but elsewhere pretend oh USA we saw in

895
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:48,569
the Los Mochis very similar state

896
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:50,679
forensic officer

897
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,470
anyway so I'm curious about the

898
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:55,509
transgenic AVR our gene potatoes nice

899
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:57,399
all kind of go down did that look like a

900
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,970
typical disease or to DC signs of

901
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,670
autoimmunity or a temperature it look

902
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:07,480
really typical like life

903
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,480
we thought there was no fee associated

904
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:19,949
this is so cool so when is it puts up

905
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,269
with the future so Jonathan ours on the

906
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,829
state of the jonathan Jones one time you

907
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:24,809
saying that our teams have you need the

908
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:26,400
very best thing since sliced bread and I

909
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:27,529
got before that and said they're never

910
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,110
gonna work

911
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:33,840
so what what what's really cool is that

912
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:37,470
if you combine the effect of an arching

913
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,470
with the fungicide that will make the RG

914
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:42,269
a lot more durable and

915
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:44,939
Simplot company is doing that you know

916
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:48,000
they have transgenic plants with our

917
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,860
genes they want those plans to receive a

918
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,679
little fungicide because as Michael

919
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:57,960
Milgram has demonstrated if you suppress

920
00:44:52,679 --> 00:45:00,509
selection then you delay the demise of a

921
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,550
particular RG and what way to do that is

922
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:04,650
to use a small amount of thunder second

923
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,870
edition so I think I think it's going to

924
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,470
be integrated management and I think

925
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,469
that's what's gonna happen

926
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:13,130
if anybody

927
00:45:15,068 --> 00:45:19,588
amazing your elders in Geneva have

928
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:19,588
questioned

929
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:35,139
to do we don't have

930
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:44,199
anybody else here

931
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:44,200
bill will help please go ahead

932
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:59,489
are you know

933
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,728
so sexual recombination

934
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:05,829
creates new genotypes and

935
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:10,179
mutation is the source of those of that

936
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:12,818
diversity so we know that my toddler

937
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:15,458
changes the law for example in a single

938
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:17,940
lineage there can be a whole bunch of

939
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:20,429
diversity for effectors that are

940
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,048
recognized by

941
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:25,568
but what we do see is you do get

942
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:28,599
tremendous more genotypic diversity in a

943
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:31,079
sexual population than and a central

944
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:31,079
partners

945
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:37,409
but we have honey clonal populations in

946
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,059
most of the early

947
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:43,318
well well we want to recognize you and

948
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:43,319
thank you again for really else

949
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:06,869
this has been a production of Cornell
