00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,129
hello my name is Celine deceases and

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:15,558
today I will be talking to you about the

5
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:18,350
mechanisms behind negative priming of

6
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:21,739
soil organic carbon by pyrogenic organic

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,140
matter so first we're going to start off

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:26,088
with the why we're really changing

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,580
scales and topics here from our last

10
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:29,598
talk or getting a lot smaller and so why

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,149
are we concerned about these

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,130
interactions and the number one why is

13
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,500
that pyrogenic organic matter is

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,239
everywhere so in recent history it's

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,609
been touted as this exciting new

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,009
agricultural amendment this magic bullet

17
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:44,719
but it's also been added to our soil for

18
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,879
hundreds of years for thousands of years

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,250
throughout human history through cook

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,080
fires burn pits and more importantly

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,179
it's been added to the soil through

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,299
natural events like forest fires

23
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,619
lightning strikes for hundreds of

24
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:00,939
thousands of years so this stuff is

25
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:03,949
ubiquitous in soils and we now know that

26
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:06,560
it has a profound it has profound

27
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,350
interactions between itself and the soil

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,118
organic carbon that's already there so

29
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:14,419
it's impacting the soil organic carbon

30
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:18,978
and in recent work in our lab we have

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,899
found some it's been found that this

32
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,090
could have long-term implications for

33
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,739
carbon storage so this is all very

34
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,390
exciting the carbon is there is

35
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:28,489
interacting with the carbon that we know

36
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,069
and care about and today we're going to

37
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:32,478
kind of pull apart these interactions

38
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:36,379
and brings break them down to a

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:38,239
mechanistic level so priming is a word

40
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,798
I'm going to be using one today and it's

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,849
used differently throughout the

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,850
literature but in relation to my work

43
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:49,339
that pile priming of soil organic carbon

44
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,188
by PI om is basically describing a

45
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,439
change in mineralization rate so when

46
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:56,419
you add pi om to soil organic carbon it

47
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:58,519
might increase the mineralization rate

48
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,289
that would be positive priming or it may

49
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,899
decrease the mineralization rate which

50
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,728
be negative priming and today we're all

51
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,019
we're only going to talk about negative

52
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,508
priming because this is what I've found

53
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:09,889
in my research and this is also kind of

54
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:13,000
what's exciting in terms of long-term

55
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,000
carbon storage

56
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,590
so this is a list of proposed mechanisms

57
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,419
of negative priming kind of gotten from

58
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,400
current literature surrounding this work

59
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,679
and we're going to walk through them one

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,150
by one and these little icons these

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,920
colorful icons on the right are going to

62
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,629
repeat throughout the presentation today

63
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,429
so you'll hear these words a lot you'll

64
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:34,048
see these colors when you see them in

65
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,610
the upper right of the screen that kind

66
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,629
of means that whatever i'm talking about

67
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,780
is related to that kind of them so this

68
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:45,000
is our baseline situation over here we

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,959
have soil microbes they're eating soil

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,299
carbon they're aspiring co2 so for their

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,039
first negative mechan- priming mechanism

72
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:55,319
we have inhibition of nutrient mining

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,798
and what's happening here is when you

74
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,780
add the pile em it basically creates a

75
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,189
nutrient source for these microbes so

76
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,289
instead of getting their nutrients from

77
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,729
the soil and aspiring that carbon is

78
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:09,019
they're going to get the nutrients from

79
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:11,729
the pile em and that will decrease their

80
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,039
soil respiration so a carbon respiration

81
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,530
so next we have toxicity so this is

82
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,229
pretty simple maybe you're adding the

83
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,318
pile em and it's killing the microbe so

84
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,750
it's reducing their respiration alright

85
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,388
next substrate switching so we're adding

86
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,430
a new substrate that some microbes might

87
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,349
find more tasty and so they're not going

88
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,340
to respire as much soil carbon they're

89
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:37,798
going to respire trial carbon substrate

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,959
dilution so this is kind of a little bit

91
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,000
of the substrate switching and also a

92
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,609
physical die we shun of the soil organic

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,769
carbon so basically the pilum addition

94
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:51,959
is making it harder so those microbes to

95
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:55,560
get at their tasty soil carbon SOC

96
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,989
sorption so pi om has a really high kind

97
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,199
of absorptive potential it has high

98
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,329
surface area charge and so what may be

99
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,430
happening is that the do see in the soil

100
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,829
or in the soil carbon in general is

101
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,359
being sorbed onto the surface of the

102
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:14,159
char and this is protecting it from

103
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:16,109
being mineralized by microbes and then

104
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,219
microbial signal structure so this is

105
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,658
something I'm not really going to touch

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,250
on today because I haven't worked with

107
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,589
it at all we're doing some of that in

108
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,468
our labs but it's exciting stuff and

109
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,569
break it down to its simplest form

110
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:29,100
essentially perhaps ty om

111
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,129
is creating a barrier between the

112
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,420
communication of microbes say one of

113
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,579
them is saying hey there's a bunch of

114
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,050
tasty food over here and the pile em is

115
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,459
blocking that from getting to their

116
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,520
fellow microbes so it's going to reduce

117
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:44,969
the amount that they were aspiring that

118
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,339
carbon and then the last one is kind of

119
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,040
facilitated aggregation in that when you

120
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,289
add PI om perhaps it's increasing the

121
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,260
ability of that soil to make aggregates

122
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,540
and cause physical protection so these

123
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,269
are kind of the mechanisms that are in

124
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,450
the literature right now and that will

125
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:07,139
be kind of talking about today so

126
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:09,120
overall my overarching question is which

127
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,189
mechanisms are responsible of that big

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,750
list that we just talked about and today

129
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,610
I'm going to break this into a couple

130
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,810
different questions and topics first

131
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,600
we're going to talk about the dilution

132
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,149
mechanism followed by substrate

133
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,740
switching toxicity and then we're going

134
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:24,870
to see kind of what's left after that

135
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,040
and how might you parse that out once

136
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,920
we've gotten rid of a couple of these

137
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,710
and so our hypotheses as I was

138
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,449
mentioning we know that PI om is very

139
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:36,689
absorptive so we're thinking that

140
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,550
sorption is a really important mechanism

141
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,350
but we also know that there's probably

142
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,090
more than one going on and so we're

143
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,860
going at that with this approach kind of

144
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:48,449
keeping an open mind throughout this

145
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,370
mechanistic study so to look at the

146
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,769
dilution experiment I set up an

147
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,949
experiment where I'm basically trying to

148
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:58,560
simulate the dilution effect with other

149
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,689
inert media so I'm adding so I'm adding

150
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,030
pile em and then I'm adding these

151
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:05,879
different media and the same volume

152
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:09,239
equivalent so I've added perlite courts

153
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,579
and and also a carbon with soil version

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,220
of the soil and I'm using in this

155
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,539
experiment i use mardan topsoil from

156
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,870
Mount Pleasant that's about five percent

157
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,330
carbon and I'm pH adjusting the charge

158
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,399
that is equals that of the soils and I'm

159
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:25,500
also adding nutrients that kind of

160
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:30,539
overwhelm any nutrient effects that you

161
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,459
would get from adding the char so this

162
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,650
experiment is really targeting the

163
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,039
mechanisms of dilution but also

164
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:39,389
substrate switching and because of the

165
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,710
way that we've created the experiment

166
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,229
were able to cross off

167
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:44,759
so we can get rid of nutrient mining

168
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,460
because we're adding more nutrients than

169
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,810
the microbes could ever really need or

170
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,199
that they could get from that extra char

171
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,180
we're also able to cross off ph effects

172
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,420
because we're at ph adjusting the chart

173
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,660
that it equals out of the soil and then

174
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,100
also this is a pretty short scale of

175
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,950
incubation it's only about 30 days and

176
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,450
so we can kind of cross that aggregation

177
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,680
because that's not quite enough time to

178
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,060
really facilitate those type of

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,769
interactions in the foil so this slide

180
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,810
is kind of walking through my general

181
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,399
method of investigation this is

182
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,550
simplified we could be like two years of

183
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,859
my life in web site so um so what we did

184
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,590
is I grew I could possibly labeled

185
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,590
willow biomass this has a really super

186
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,929
high 13 c label and then we're creating

187
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:33,389
piyo em out of this biomass so for this

188
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,879
experiment i'm using a 450 degree char

189
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,979
and then we're adding that char to the

190
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,680
soil and also our other amendments or

191
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,930
their treatments we're wetting these and

192
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,560
then we're monitoring their respiration

193
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,540
over time and we monitor the restoration

194
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,670
using this fancy machine on the seventh

195
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,060
floor of the Picaro and essentially what

196
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,340
this thing spits out is a ppm co2

197
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,009
respired per day and also an isotope

198
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,989
value that corresponds with that co2 so

199
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,550
with those two numbers were able to

200
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,740
throw a little bit of algebra at it and

201
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,870
basically determine how much of that

202
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,610
soil how much of that respiration is

203
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,620
coming from the soil and how much is

204
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,150
coming from the char and through that

205
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,490
calculation we're able to determine

206
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:19,949
priming so these are some results from

207
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,019
that first experiment so we can see

208
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,430
first I'm going to explain this chart

209
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,740
actually because I'm going to be using

210
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,780
these units a lot today so on the y axis

211
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,000
we have cumulative soil c respired

212
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:35,100
divided by the initial soil in the jar

213
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,899
so this is normalizing every treatment

214
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,810
based on the amount of carbon that they

215
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,730
started with and it's also cumulative so

216
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:45,179
it's adding the amount of soil carbon

217
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:47,370
respired day by day so we see here is

218
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,469
the black line is the control so that's

219
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,330
just the soil we've added nothing to it

220
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,610
and in this particular experiment we

221
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,389
experienced negative priming for all of

222
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,180
our treatments

223
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:00,330
so even just adding sands completely

224
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,219
inert really low surface area media we

225
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,650
had some negative climbing with that but

226
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,389
we can also see that the perlite may be

227
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,459
a little more surface area more negative

228
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:10,379
priming followed by this ash sub soil

229
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,660
contains clay probably a lot more

230
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,309
interaction going on with that media and

231
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,639
then finally we have the most negative

232
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:20,009
priming with our PI om edition and so

233
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,860
what we can say about the aleutian is

234
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,019
that perhaps the dilution effect can be

235
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,730
explained by this difference between the

236
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,939
control in the sand or even the control

237
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,340
in the pot and the in the perlite but

238
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,750
this isn't completely compensating for

239
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,910
the amount of negative priming that we

240
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:41,370
have from our char and so this is

241
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:43,500
another way to look at this data so this

242
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,080
is you know the same treatment but

243
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,690
instead of cumulative it's looking at

244
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,940
daily soil carbon respiration and so you

245
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,740
can see that most of this effect most of

246
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,660
this negative priming is happening

247
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,360
rather quickly within the first five

248
00:09:54,659 --> 00:10:00,240
days and also on this chart I've added

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,620
the respiration of the char itself you

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,289
can see that this has it's pretty

251
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,700
negligible compared to the soil carbon

252
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:11,009
that's being inspired and finally what

253
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,870
I've done is I've taken each treatment

254
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:14,939
away from the control so that we can

255
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,279
really have a look at the magnitude of

256
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,810
priming that's going on so the control

257
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,459
doesn't exist in this experiment because

258
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:23,250
it's Bureau that's what this line is

259
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,700
right here and what we can see is we can

260
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,379
see this increasing negative priming

261
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,590
kind of weird language when less is more

262
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,240
but we can see that yes we have

263
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,850
significant negative priming with this

264
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,519
pi om treatment and up here is the

265
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,050
respired char and so we can also see

266
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,029
that the restoration of the char

267
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,429
definitely can't compensate for the

268
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:48,899
amount of negative priming that we have

269
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:51,299
of soil carbon respiration so overall

270
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,009
from that experiment what we can say is

271
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,409
that dilution definitely isn't the only

272
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,639
story neither its substrate substrate

273
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:58,649
switching but we're going to get back to

274
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,689
that but both are definitely having an

275
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:04,559
effect they're exerting negative priming

276
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,540
and this is kind of showing us of all

277
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,679
this negative priming exerted by the

278
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,079
chart

279
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,759
me this much about about this much at

280
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,310
this point can be described by this

281
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,600
dilution effect and this much by

282
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,609
substrate switching so we still have

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,740
this huge part of the pie that's

284
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:25,950
unexplained mechanistically so far ok so

285
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,740
now moving on we're going to target

286
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,230
substrate switching as well as soil

287
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,269
organic carbon sorption and so the next

288
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,528
questions to get at these new mechanisms

289
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,370
now that we've kind of crossed off

290
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:40,169
dilution is how can you be term oh and

291
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,450
also toxicity so that's an important one

292
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:44,278
so first for toxicity how can we

293
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,110
determine that the char we're applying

294
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,120
is not just killing these microbes and

295
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,419
that's what's causing these interesting

296
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,039
effects next can we make a better case

297
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,409
for refuting the substrate switching

298
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,778
that might be happening and finally if

299
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:59,338
sorption is this driving mechanism kind

300
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,929
of does it have an end point is there a

301
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,029
smaller amount of char we could add that

302
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:08,278
wouldn't have this exciting negative

303
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:10,019
fremming so to ask the answer these

304
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,759
questions I designed an application rate

305
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,309
experiment and it's really simple just

306
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,429
adding kind of different concentrations

307
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,559
of char to the same soil that I use in

308
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:22,679
my last experiment so we're adding point

309
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,500
5 12 and a half five and ten milligrams

310
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,899
per gram char to the dry soil that same

311
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,580
size percent carbon soil and we're

312
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,899
trying to see if there's an ideal

313
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,900
application rate for negative priming

314
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,399
and also if negative priming doesn't

315
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,559
exist at all over application rate

316
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,679
because maybe all the absorption sites

317
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,359
of the char totally used up and so other

318
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,250
kind of other factors are over

319
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,440
overwhelming this negative farming so

320
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,190
we're kind of trying to see if it has as

321
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,870
an end point and this is kind of a

322
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,070
simplified version of the results but

323
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,649
it's the same type of figure we saw

324
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:58,079
before cumulative soil c respired and

325
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:01,169
here we see we have our control again in

326
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,819
black but we have positive priming as

327
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,919
opposed to the last experiment where we

328
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,339
only had negative priming so when you

329
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,059
add the one milligram per gram

330
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,250
application rate we're actually

331
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,949
increasing the rate of soil organic

332
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,570
carbon mineralization but when we have

333
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,490
the higher application rates of five and

334
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,980
ten this is decreasing the

335
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,009
mineralization so it's important to note

336
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,129
that yes

337
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:26,700
char's is kind of causing negative

338
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:29,500
priming but it may not in all situations

339
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,080
and this is something we'll kind of have

340
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,870
to parse out in the future but maybe if

341
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,520
it's the mechanism like sorption those

342
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,909
sites are being used up there's no more

343
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:43,779
slice left to absorb the carbon so we

344
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:46,240
have positive framing and again this is

345
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,860
that same kind of figure taking away

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,480
each treatment from the controls to see

347
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,190
the magnitude of priming see the

348
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,980
positive standing over here the negative

349
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,140
here and again to speak to the substrate

350
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,420
switching mechanism which if we can all

351
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:01,389
recall is where the microbes are eating

352
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:04,149
the char instead of the soil this

353
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:07,049
basically the cumulation of the soil of

354
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,279
the char carbon respired would be would

355
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:11,259
describe that substrate switching and we

356
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,419
can see that the magnitude of this

357
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:15,299
respiration is nowhere near the

358
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,829
magnitude of our total negative priming

359
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:21,849
so we can really kind of cross off

360
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:24,430
substrate searching at this place and to

361
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,610
speak to toxicity this is kind of the

362
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:29,500
easiest way that I could think of to

363
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,360
kind of a say how microbes are doing

364
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,299
after being exposed to charge so this is

365
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,730
a fumigation extraction method of

366
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:39,069
microbial biomass so after I've

367
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,830
incubated my char in my soil for 40 days

368
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,360
I completed this assay and what this is

369
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,310
saying this is kind of a messy grass

370
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,730
with huge error bars is basically that

371
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:50,889
there's no significant differences in

372
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,500
microbial biomass communities if we're

373
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:55,240
adding charge or if pilum or if we're

374
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,610
not and this is looking at both the

375
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,860
topsoil and also a sub soil so a higher

376
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,570
carbon soil and a lower part as well so

377
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:06,129
you can kind of stage from this that

378
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:09,129
toxicity isn't really occurring which is

379
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:10,539
what this was saying over here and so

380
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,789
now we're going to move on to what we

381
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:14,829
have left so finally we're going to talk

382
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:18,189
about SSD sorption because that seems

383
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,700
most likely as a candidate for our

384
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,890
negative priming that we're seeing and a

385
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,750
really neat way to look at sorption is

386
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:28,600
just creating these adsorption isotherms

387
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,370
so I've taken different concentrations

388
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,379
of do see from the soil I use in my

389
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,950
incubation and I've shaken them

390
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:36,590
overnight with

391
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,160
different media so either a 200-degree

392
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:42,649
charge 450 degree char 752 creature or

393
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:46,429
these two soils and what you're seeing

394
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:49,429
here is over here we have desorption so

395
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:51,229
below the zero line all this DLC was

396
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:53,029
desorbed so we're seeing complete

397
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,250
resorption for this high temperature

398
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,159
with low temperature chart as well as

399
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,740
the topsoil and kind of the subsoil is

400
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,689
right in the middle and then for our

401
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,629
charge for our higher temperature charts

402
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,850
we have these or patients at lower

403
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:10,100
concentrations adsorption at higher

404
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,480
concentrations for the 450 degree char

405
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,680
which is the one I used in the

406
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,789
experiments I've talked about already

407
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,049
and we have complete pre almost complete

408
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:20,029
these absorption with a higher

409
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:21,740
temperature chart so as you increase the

410
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,490
temperature of pyrolysis we're having

411
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,950
more absorption another really exciting

412
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,250
way to look at adsorption institue is

413
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:35,240
nano SIM so I've labeled my charge very

414
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,889
highly with Delta 13 C and using this

415
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,379
amazing technique we're able to look at

416
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:43,159
the char and see what kind of carbon is

417
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:46,159
sticking to it so the char by itself so

418
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,289
this is one that's been uninvited so it

419
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,819
just has a super high delta 13 c value

420
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,069
which is indicated by this purple color

421
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,250
and this is a piece of char that's been

422
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,500
incubated with soil for 40 days and so

423
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,480
we can see that on the surface we have

424
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,539
these modeled colors we have a lot of

425
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,400
the slough natural abundance carbon so

426
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:06,769
what this is telling us is that over

427
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
time we are seeing adsorption of natural

428
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:10,699
abundance carbon on the surface of char

429
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,400
this can't tell us what exactly we're

430
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:15,949
looking at or why this is happening but

431
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,650
it's kind of a new neat way to be able

432
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,630
to look at sorption institue and

433
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,820
hopefully in the future this will be

434
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,140
kind of more quantitative science that

435
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:30,609
will be able to make more conclusive

436
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:33,050
more conclusions with so in conclusion

437
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:35,899
basically we've been able to cross off

438
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:38,509
or minimize a couple of these mechanisms

439
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,420
today and so and based on our results

440
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:45,440
we're thinking that SOC sorption is an

441
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:47,360
important mechanism we also have a lot

442
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,429
further to go with things

443
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:54,259
microbial signal sorption kind of

444
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:56,390
aggregation and we also know that this

445
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:58,400
is probably a combination of many

446
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,470
mechanisms as we've seen today we can

447
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,960
kind of compensate for part of this pie

448
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,120
but there's so much left and is all that

449
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,429
really coming from sorption maybe maybe

450
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,029
not we've basically ended the day with

451
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:13,820
more questions than we started with but

452
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:16,129
it is called research for a reason and

453
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:18,678
it's exciting to keep moving forward and

454
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:22,520
this mechanistic approach is just I

455
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,980
really love how really deeply scientific

456
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,079
it is it's just kind of probing at the

457
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,058
continuous details and being able to

458
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,099
build further from that and I've really

459
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,149
enjoyed this type of science and it

460
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:34,789
wouldn't be possible without my

461
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,410
committees so honis and janice and also

462
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,289
everyone in my lab who helped me out

463
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:42,169
especially our amazing research research

464
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:45,079
technicians and really everyone the

465
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:47,190
student hasn't done without my lab and

466
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:54,939
without all of you thank you

467
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:54,940
[Applause]

468
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,659
yeah so the soil I got it from Mount

469
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:15,788
Pleasant and kind of homogenized took

470
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:17,649
out all the rest rocks and roots and

471
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:20,440
dried it out saved it and then

472
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:21,939
completely dried it down and then I've

473
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,548
messed around I've done a lot of

474
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,798
iterations of the incubation or as like

475
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:29,109
pre-incubated the soil but for these

476
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,750
experiments today I mixed them with the

477
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:33,729
amendments dry and then added water

478
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,308
right before it started which i found

479
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:39,788
was just kind of the most types of Titus

480
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:41,109
way to keep everything keep everything

481
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:43,869
the same it's really hard when you're

482
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:45,339
like mixing mud and char together so

483
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:47,709
that's how they were treated before and

484
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:50,888
yes I have other experiments where have

485
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,649
added usually I'm adding an uncharged

486
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:55,719
version of the pile em so I am adding

487
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:57,699
biomass and in those were basically

488
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,130
seeing we are seeing negative priming

489
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,139
but it's mostly compensated for by this

490
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:06,399
substrate switching so you can see this

491
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:10,000
huge surge in the in the microbes eating

492
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:11,589
that that's like spicy exciting carbon

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,669
source and it's definitely different

494
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:17,879
mechanisms been with the charge any

495
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,880
other

496
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:29,200
the ones the five percent organic carbon

497
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:31,959
that sort of left so that was the way to

498
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,870
start with naturally yeah yes kind of a

499
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,170
tough yeah it's uh it's kind of like the

500
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:48,579
topsoil of yeah Mount Pleasant you have

501
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:51,250
four and a half five you can program

502
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:53,829
yeah at point five one two and a half

503
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,289
five and ten and on my figure I only

504
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:58,210
showed a couple of them because the

505
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,700
point five and the two and a half just

506
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,250
kind of mess like muddied it up but

507
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,259
essentially the points I've exerted

508
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,839
positive framing as well as the one as

509
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:09,579
you saw and the 2.5 exerted negative

510
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,289
priming but neither of those were

511
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:12,579
different enough from the control they

512
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,700
just kind of make it look a little messy

513
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:18,299
so what I was just going to be some

514
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:22,509
calculated in my head of what I mean

515
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:30,009
qualifying yes when acres of land so

516
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:31,629
yeah so I'm for the and so the for the

517
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:34,359
five milligrams per gram application

518
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,630
rate which is the one that we had that I

519
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,309
had on the figure so that would exert

520
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:43,050
kind of significantly different negative

521
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:48,099
priming and that translates to about

522
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:52,029
four tonnes per hectare four tonnes per

523
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:55,719
hectare yes no four tons per acre about

524
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:57,750
11 tonnes per hectare yes he did a lot

525
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,750
in

526
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,589
that would be yeah that would be a large

527
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:08,158
application so if you think about adding

528
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:11,428
compost a typical addition of compost is

529
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,650
about 10 tons per hectare 10 tons per

530
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:16,740
acre which is twice the amount of my

531
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:20,759
application rate but that has a similar

532
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,069
bulk density or even like much higher

533
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,869
higher than the char which is really

534
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:26,399
fluffy stuff so this would be like yeah

535
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,869
we would be adding a significant amount

536
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,820
of char but it's also confusing because

537
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:34,649
of the you know the depth of soil and

538
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:36,029
like that 8-inch plow where I don't it's

539
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,890
kind of really hard to translate it to

540
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,538
this but it would be like a significant

541
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,530
addition of char yeah it's not a

542
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:47,849
sprinkle yeah so you can away why cause

543
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:49,230
the mountain forms then over time I mean

544
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,459
that's kind of what this is saying but

545
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,860
we definitely need to look into that

546
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,750
more and break that down into especially

547
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,359
field experiments I mean this is in jars

548
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,079
in a lab so we need to accept this

549
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,079
further yes

550
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,570
we added oil

551
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:28,990
what well I don't think it should be

552
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,558
ruled out but I guess for me it wasn't

553
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:35,710
as exciting to look at so char has an

554
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,359
inherently like super high pH and a lot

555
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,480
of the soils I'm looking at our around

556
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,428
for so we know that's going to have a

557
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,950
huge effect to me we know that that's

558
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:46,929
probably I mean it's just kind of

559
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,110
something that we know what's happening

560
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:51,548
and that I didn't I just kind of wanted

561
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:53,048
to look at different mechanisms I wanted

562
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:54,519
to try to control for that and I know

563
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,558
it's super hard to control for that

564
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,839
because basically I'm adjusting the ph

565
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:02,230
with HD el Halim industrial ph of the

566
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:04,658
char which maybe isn't completely you

567
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,279
know compensating for the pH changes but

568
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,530
for me I was just kind of more

569
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,240
interested in other mechanisms that we

570
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,668
didn't know already had a profound

571
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,429
effect like we know pH is so important

572
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:18,009
like creation th and moisture arguably

573
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:22,110
like the most important factors but I

574
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:22,109
was kind of trying to probe beyond those

575
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,420
support

576
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:45,990
yeah it could very well be and that's

577
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:48,289
not something that I've looked at so in

578
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,289
the future

579
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:06,690
Oh

580
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,270
in fact we provide a little garden

581
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:29,640
pretty much what reduced at high ph oh I

582
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,009
don't know because I've only looked at

583
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,040
the system with these pH adjusted

584
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,019
situations but I mean I could it would

585
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,349
be pretty easy to do at these adsorption

586
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:42,720
isotherms with a nun pH adjusted charge

587
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,909
to see what happens because as we're

588
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,410
seeing in one of my first pieces of data

589
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,290
a lot of this negative priming is hat

590
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:52,380
can be happening very quickly so within

591
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:55,230
the scope of you know a 24 or 36 36 hour

592
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,420
adsorption experiment so I guess we'll

593
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,099
have to see I'm not sure how the change

594
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,100
in charge or pho

595
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,039
I

596
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:13,629
um we don't I mean we don't know it

597
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,829
could be i mean that's like adsorption

598
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,570
is something that could be happening

599
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:20,279
that quickly and it would probably

600
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:23,019
increase if you had a super high ph char

601
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:30,490
but that's not the mannequin feature yet

602
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:40,960
cuz i haven't tried it out there the

603
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:43,089
changing position without oh yeah i mean

604
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,440
they're definitely our changes sia my

605
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:47,349
kind of credit mr. did some work with

606
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,730
that kara in my lab is also working with

607
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:54,750
that that's not something that I've

608
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,750
looked at at all kind of avoided it but

609
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:07,230
this has been a production of Cornell

610
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:07,230
University on the web at cornell edu
