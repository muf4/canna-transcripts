1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,739
I just love sharing what I know with all

4
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,958
of you and I know we've got growers in

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,868
the audience we got graduate students in

6
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:19,448
the audience we've got garden centers in

7
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:21,189
the audience we got everything and I and

8
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,110
I'm pleased to be able to do that

9
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:25,449
somebody will recognize me and I got

10
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:31,689
heck last night Jeff told me where's my

11
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:36,399
hat so this is me I am here all right i

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:38,590
am here so so and again i have way too

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,960
little time to tell way too many stories

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:44,710
but the fact is that this hat is a whole

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,230
lot more important than i am but we got

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,509
i gave you a handout which is kind of

17
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:52,148
fun to do of course boats fit percent of

18
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:54,960
it you won't even see today but it'd be

19
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:57,370
a good handle for you anyway and i am

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,770
going to talk about veggies as well

21
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:01,599
because unlike Peter I haven't quite

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,129
gotten all the way there but I love

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,349
veggies we've been we've been trialing

24
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:08,109
veggies at the University of Georgia for

25
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,969
all the new what I call patio vegetables

26
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,010
ornamental vegetables my daughter who is

27
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,959
going to get vegetables and doesn't want

28
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,030
to have a vegetable garden my neighbors

29
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,609
who want vegetables but don't want to

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,109
make a big deal and so I've been doing

31
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:22,450
this for some time as well I'll show you

32
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:26,250
a few things but in the meantime here's

33
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:29,049
what I'm going to do everybody we talk

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,879
forever about how we're going to get

35
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,880
young people and I look at young people

36
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:37,149
anybody under 50 as a young person into

37
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,489
this hood of his game and everybody and

38
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,009
I mean everybody is using a cell phone

39
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:44,469
smartphone to do things by my son who's

40
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:46,030
way too old living in San Francisco and

41
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,379
he doesn't move a muscle without doing

42
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,379
this little thing whether it's an uber

43
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:52,449
or a restaurant or a review and so why

44
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:57,129
don't we do something about what we do

45
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,020
on the smartphone I mean if you look to

46
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:01,269
try and find information on the web you

47
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:03,039
can find a ton of things but you got to

48
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,629
be sitting on the web okay so you go to

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,820
your phone go to the webinars a ton of

50
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:08,799
things a ton of different places why

51
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,389
don't we find a place that works so I

52
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:14,010
have developed this for what it's worth

53
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:17,229
and if it's if it works bill we will see

54
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,060
if this thing actually happens and if it

55
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:23,429
doesn't happen I

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:26,340
really giving you a great haha so this

57
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,250
is a cell phone on the right you can see

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,180
an app called Armitage okay I have

59
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,419
developed an app for you for gardeners

60
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,480
landscapers garden centers anybody who

61
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:42,179
touches plants all right and it is an

62
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,729
app that I developed for my neighbors

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,159
and my daughter's people not like you

64
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,639
know something but people who want to

65
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,930
know something and they don't want it so

66
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,539
complicated I can't figure out what to

67
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,549
do so if you do this and this is totally

68
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,099
up to you there's about 10,000 on this

69
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,590
thing right now if you do this you just

70
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,750
go to your and this is right now and I

71
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,848
really hesitate to say this right now

72
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,209
the new version what you're looking at

73
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:11,459
is on the iphone and ipad it will be on

74
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,019
the android hopefully by next week but

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,479
if you have an Android you want to do it

76
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,799
wait all right just wait for a week or

77
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,949
so because the new version is much

78
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,150
better than the old one having said that

79
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,798
if you want to do about your App Store

80
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,750
search armitage and this will come right

81
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,310
up it's called dr. raise greatest

82
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,780
perennials and annuals and I guess going

83
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,250
to demonstrate this wrote five minutes

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,189
and then we'll get into the talk so if

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,739
you hit this thing ok it comes up here

86
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:38,699
and then it comes up to this screen so

87
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,230
this is your iphone screen or your iPad

88
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,449
which is really spectacular by the way

89
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,949
it says everything up there and there's

90
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,629
all sorts of stuff there's there's

91
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,159
there's a ton of things but let me go to

92
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,500
the ton of things that you're interested

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,329
in like every single plant that you sell

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,750
and I'm saying you sell you breed you

95
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:57,030
work with is on here so and reels and

96
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,769
perennials and whatever here's angelonia

97
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,389
for example i'm just going to this is a

98
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:06,060
good place to start as any if you hit

99
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:08,519
this ok it comes up and it's real simple

100
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,509
its common name every single plant has a

101
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,759
deer browsing rating meaning so in other

102
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:17,310
words if you hit this it says three and

103
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,399
it comes up and it says one two three

104
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,449
four or five is it is it a hosta or is

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,250
it something that they're not going to

106
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,079
get really touch now dear will he eat

107
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,939
anything we know this but having done

108
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,459
all the research on this it's the best I

109
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,379
can do also on here there's a rabbit

110
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,008
browsing the same thing Heights etc so

111
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,288
it's real self

112
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:37,379
and you can see it says why it makes my

113
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:39,628
cut sorry gang it's my app so like it or

114
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,908
don't like it and I tell you why I think

115
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:45,689
it's a good plant and you know believe

116
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:47,278
it or not actually a few people actually

117
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,189
think i know what i'm talking about so

118
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:51,749
it's it's good hints for success for my

119
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,789
neighbor for your neighbor it's its Sun

120
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,800
as its shade is it what's it need etc

121
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:57,930
and then the neat thing is my top

122
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,919
choices so these are the varieties are

123
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,968
the cultivars that you're probably

124
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,378
selling anyway having said all that

125
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,748
people like pictures so if I can do this

126
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,249
picture right here I can then do this

127
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:10,020
picture and it's going to take a little

128
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:11,849
bit of time but there's there's about 12

129
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,288
different pictures of Angeloni on here

130
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:18,978
which I can see is not going to happen

131
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:22,348
but anyway we'll go back hold on maybe

132
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:24,180
maybe if I do it this way anyway all

133
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,949
these little dots up there each one is a

134
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,899
different photograph and most of them

135
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,050
are the ones that I am recommending so

136
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,119
you have photos you have information you

137
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,770
have something it's really simple but

138
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,870
let me show you something else so any

139
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,579
plan is in here I mean we could have fun

140
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,728
with this there's videos on here where

141
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,658
I'm yapping about something there's a

142
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:46,168
lots of goodies let me show you a couple

143
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:48,629
of other things if I go over here this

144
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:50,668
says plants so you can do annuals or

145
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,199
perennials or natives or grasses you can

146
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:54,209
go all the way down to a usda zone

147
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,749
you're in ok so you can do all that kind

148
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:59,959
of stuff and that's fun but if I also go

149
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:02,909
over here I hit garden centers now I I

150
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,788
know the sewer marg atoms are here

151
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:07,110
somewhere and i know that i wrote a

152
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:09,538
bunch of you if there's any garden

153
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,189
center people in the audience and if i

154
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,408
wrote you and you ignored me so be it

155
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:18,028
but you can get listed on this app free

156
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:20,158
of charge so these are people in in the

157
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:22,740
area there were 200 miles in the area

158
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:24,028
but so here's Adams there in Kingston

159
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,009
their new burger Poughkeepsie and

160
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:28,709
they're in wappinger waban girl whatever

161
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,569
anyway so if I hit this thing what

162
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,889
happens on any garden center if you know

163
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:34,110
a good garden center and these are good

164
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,088
garden centers I'm not going to internet

165
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,430
and grabbing them I'm writing them based

166
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:40,620
on recommendations or they write me so

167
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,050
it says okay here's Adams Ferris in

168
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,360
Kingston this is something that sue sent

169
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,930
me or whatever okay that's cool phone

170
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,910
number

171
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,379
can call them the global thing that's

172
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,120
their website I won't hit it because

173
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,100
it's just real slow in here and the

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,590
other thing up here and again I'll hit

175
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,509
it but I want to want to work is go go

176
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,668
google maps so google maps will take you

177
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,069
right there wherever you're standing so

178
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:04,379
any garden center in the country who

179
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,978
wants to get on here gets listed free of

180
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:11,009
charge and what it costs them is to tell

181
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,930
their people that they're on the app but

182
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,788
they're on the app so why wouldn't they

183
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,319
tell them anyway and the last thing I'm

184
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:19,110
going to show you is things that I

185
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,879
believe in there's birds and butterflies

186
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,530
so everybody who's in a sustainable

187
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,240
thing you'd like this there's a couple

188
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:26,549
of good books I like ground covers I

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,220
work with HGTV here's some thoughts on

190
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,449
plant food you know this is

191
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,770
recommendation of my daughters and

192
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,439
others too little time and too little

193
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:36,089
money nobody fertilizes plants you know

194
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,189
we talked about it but they don't

195
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,899
fertilize a lot so we found something

196
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,629
and I work with a really key cool cuff

197
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,939
and it's out here and this cool company

198
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,370
is called nature source and anyway so if

199
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,199
it says a plant food it says how to get

200
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,209
it it says what stores are doing it

201
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,590
right here and the cool thing again and

202
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:56,908
unfortunately probably oh good I took

203
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,288
some photos just this has done to

204
00:07:56,908 --> 00:08:00,209
Cornell this is done in the greenhouses

205
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:01,469
yesterday with nature source vs. not

206
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,509
nature so that again I'm not selling it

207
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,830
I don't do whatever you want but I'm

208
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,839
just showing it this is what I believe

209
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,939
in and so on I believe in something I

210
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,288
like to tell the world so there's one on

211
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,699
the right with nature source on the left

212
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,168
with something else and there's a whole

213
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,848
slew of these things that we can show

214
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:18,418
but nevertheless so this is what this

215
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:20,430
app does it is for and I tell you who's

216
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:23,758
really using it or the staff of garden

217
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,829
centers they can go behind a pole I can

218
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,639
check it out and can I guess there how

219
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:31,288
can I help you so so anyway I wanted to

220
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,509
show you that because that is truly a

221
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:35,639
trend if there is one trend in this

222
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:37,649
world it is a smartphone and the trend

223
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,389
that we have never even taken advantage

224
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,799
of at all I mean I mean horticulture

225
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,968
magazine has their thing and we probably

226
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,458
all have a little thing here and there

227
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,899
but what are your neighbor have you know

228
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,519
I get high with wish they would buy all

229
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,159
my books and Holliman are not going to

230
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,769
so my daughter for sure well by one of

231
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,689
my books so the thing is that's what

232
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,889
this is all about so if you want if

233
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,480
you're interested have fun if your

234
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,490
garden center let me know i'll certainly

235
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,789
put you on if anybody needs a card and

236
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,310
stuff

237
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,019
we'll do it so that that's the app and I

238
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,359
wanted shorter now we're going to get

239
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:13,129
into something else assuming we can make

240
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:15,120
this work so you have a handout and

241
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,289
again I'll never get through all this

242
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,210
stuff so they don't worry about it we'll

243
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,730
do the best we can I've already taken a

244
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,259
bunch of stuff off you know I'm lugging

245
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,360
a mark and Sue here I know they're going

246
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,950
to carry much of this stuff I work with

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,779
so many different people i work with a

248
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,080
pro a place called the perennial far

249
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,549
more over the nature source people I'll

250
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,020
Newsome is here with this good dirt

251
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,479
which is going to be a great product for

252
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,610
you guys coming down the road I work

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,560
with HDTV so they have any questions and

254
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,690
all that stuff I certainly worked with a

255
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,969
cut flower people and I can't wait to

256
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,890
hear what Chris has to say so it's good

257
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,019
and of course I've always I've often

258
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,220
been speaking with Marjorie and its

259
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,620
really good to speak with Marjorie

260
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,480
because I know I have pretty stuff and

261
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,500
Marjorie comes in and boy my stuff looks

262
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,210
awful after she's done with it so well

263
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,580
so anyway how can we keep up with us to

264
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,790

272
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:30,149
fact is it's there and I mean let's see

273
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:34,470
if there's this thing working maybe this

274
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,000
is merc know and are we really serious i

275
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,620
think truly is there such a thing as a

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,759
ketchup and fries plant are we really

277
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:49,500
gone that far down the road so here we

278
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:50,879
go anyway this is plants that I and I

279
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,110
talk about plants a lot i talk about

280
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,610
marketing a lot of how about anything

281
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,240
you want me to talk but unfortunately

282
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,590
but this is in front of stores in a

283
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,870
little town in Canada called

284
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,580
niagara-on-the-lake if you get to nag on

285
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,830
the lake you'll understand why plants

286
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,780
make a difference this town and many

287
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,670
other towns I know I'm in Cooperstown as

288
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,549
fabulous too they plant plants because

289
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,629
they know in front of stores that people

290
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:14,939
are more comfortable when there's

291
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,580
around they know that and they'll spend

292
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,370
more money it's a simple thing so we can

293
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,860
do you know we can beautify America we

294
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,860
have programs to certainly help towns

295
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,779
and all do beautification just plant

296
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,580
some plants and if you're a grower give

297
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,370
plants away to stores help them to do it

298
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,200
this is how we get it done you know as

299
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,610
much work it is to sell plants and

300
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,170
customers simply want to have fun

301
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,970
remember that I don't care how serious

302
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:41,939
you get their customer is not serious so

303
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,560
serious about spending money but they do

304
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,930
it for therapy and they do it for the

305
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,169
beauty they don't have that same kind of

306
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:50,309
like in those guys and in general I mean

307
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:51,299
you know I mean you've got these master

308
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,279
gardeners it'll knock your head off

309
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,500
absolutely without a doubt but the fact

310
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,299
is people buy plants for therapy it

311
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,259
makes them feel good quite truthfully

312
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,240
and and and keep them happy don't take

313
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,529
yourself seriously like goodness you

314
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,990
take yourself seriously you would just

315
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:09,059
have no friends whatsoever because this

316
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,590
is who we are okay come on let's just

317
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,819
get ourselves under don't take me

318
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,060
seriously I can tell you a bunch of

319
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,510
stuff because I think this is my hundred

320
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,369
years in in practice here has shown me

321
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:22,529
what I think are great plan so that

322
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,970
people want to do but you're you're

323
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:28,019
going to walk with here hopefully with

324
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,580
two plants out of all these so it says

325
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,889
American horticulture gardening have

326
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,720
come a long way but gang just in case

327
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,149
you're wondering let's not get ourselves

328
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,090
too carried away we still have a long

329
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:41,970
way to go we really do but this was cool

330
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,700
because there were three new guinea

331
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,820
impatience this year and next year we

332
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,370
are hoping for six if we could double

333
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,690
the number of plants and person buys we

334
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,610
ever be in pretty good shape wouldn't we

335
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,080
but we have come a long way we really

336
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,060
have and where do you see what that with

337
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,860
Kendra and group have done this

338
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,489
afternoon it's really neat the plants

339
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,610
that are out there but we're going to

340
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,899
start with these off the line creatures

341
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,789
we're going to start today with annuals

342
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,409
okay and angles really are maligned you

343
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,759
know there's so many plants knobs out

344
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:17,309
there and they certainly wouldn't

345
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,750
wouldn't buy annuals oh my goodness now

346
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,609
those of you who are in the garden

347
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,409
center business and in the petunia trade

348
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,850
and a calibrachoa tray we know how

349
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:26,429
important these are for landscapers are

350
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,050
no important they are for those people

351
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:34,109
want to beautify properties but you know

352
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:37,588
angles a geranium a miracle you I'd be

353
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:40,019
kidding but it is it is so fabulous what

354
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,640
has gone on out here and the breeding

355
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,110
has been nothing short of spectacular

356
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,240
you're going to see some of that this

357
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,500
afternoon as well so I'm just going to

358
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,810
start taking you through a merry little

359
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,509
tour of some of the plants that I think

360
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:54,109
are terrific and again I don't have a

361
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:57,990
lot of time so if I do speed up please

362
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,990
yes i'm in North Country now so you can

363
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,019
raise your hand and I can say yes if you

364
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,480
don't know something shoot the puck let

365
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:11,370
me know all right shoot apart can't do

366
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,250
that Georgia rule will you can old

367
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,750
Canuck that's all we used to do so it's

368
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,399
early i hope you're ready because it is

369
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,919
time to start the engines this is where

370
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,028
your your handout starts and if you see

371
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:26,129
anything you want to take a look at

372
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:28,379
please feel free angelonia and again

373
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,088
I've really cold this list down again I

374
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:34,320
do talks and annuals at last I horse

375
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:36,029
really boring but angelonia called angel

376
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,230
flower called summer Snapdragon whatever

377
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:38,580
you want to do it's a plant that

378
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,100
tolerate you know you've had a nice

379
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,230
relatively cool summer lots of rain here

380
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,269
I know the assembly and joins look

381
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,009
pretty good at the trials of if you get

382
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,480
a summer where it's warmer and you get a

383
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,299
summer where's dryer this is a fabulous

384
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,740
plant and what I I think and I've told

385
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,079
all my students and I think all of you

386
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,399
understand even though my daughter will

387
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,940
come in and she won't have a clue what a

388
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,929
cultivar is it's a cult of our world I

389
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,120
don't even know what the specie of this

390
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:06,120
looks like anymore so we live in a cult

391
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,399
of our world so you should know and it

392
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,070
gets really are there any other any

393
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,600
retailers here okay well you guys are

394
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,310
where the rubber hits the road you must

395
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,290
understand this that when your neighbor

396
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:18,569
comes in to your store and looks or

397
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:21,870
something they're not going to ask for

398
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,459
carita angelonia but if you realize or

399
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,810
you know because you've walked around

400
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,639
you've looked around you studied you've

401
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,619
maybe even believe me but this is a good

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,539
series then you sell them that because

403
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,519
if you're not coming into your store

404
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,539
because they don't like you they're

405
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,819
coming into your store because they

406
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:37,799
trust you and you don't have to sell

407
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,930
them a cult of our name but you have to

408
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,459
sell in a good cultivar

409
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:45,419
because nobody comes into your store

410
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:48,509
today nobody and says hey Mark what's

411
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,219
old right nobody says that and they come

412
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,470
in they say what's new they go they'll

413
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,720
all know what's new well what's new to

414
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,050
you my daughter's going to see for five

415
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,490
years all right so what's new is really

416
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:02,639
means what what do you got that's good

417
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,289
and so anyway so enough of that that

418
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,580
that's this one that I think is a

419
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,809
terrific there's another series out

420
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,360
there the Sarah need is which are a

421
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:11,519
little shorter the whole short and

422
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,930
compact thing we really kind of like is

423
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,490
an industry because we can ship them

424
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,989
easier we don't have to maintain quite

425
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,820
as much in the landscape they're

426
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,060
generally better bright better braking

427
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,450
and they're just as easy to grow so this

428
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,859
is pink and there's other colors as well

429
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:29,879
Archangel dark rose these are all on

430
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,740
your hand oh by the way so just you know

431
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,838
we need different colors so I picked a

432
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,570
few from this and the other thing that

433
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,660
is really happening today to the garden

434
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:42,950
of today and certainly the garden of

435
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:47,189
tomorrow without a doubt is the deck

436
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:50,070
okay absolutely that means containers

437
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,110
baskets and what you see from the deck

438
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,230
so you can have a garden I don't mean to

439
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,180
say to me no gardens but containers and

440
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,070
baskets are becoming more important not

441
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,719
just because well they're kind of fun

442
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,339
what else are we going to do with a

443
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,720
bacopa I mean what else going to do

444
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,400
throw in a container because it nobody

445
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,009
else would have it otherwise but the

446
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,530
fact is you know a lot of these plants

447
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:12,240
have been bred to fall out of baskets to

448
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,369
fall out of containers and that's a good

449
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,410
thing so these spreading ones I think

450
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,428
are good there's even spreading roses

451
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,420
you might know that actually are

452
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:24,990
designed for baskets so this is a trend

453
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,390
to be sure you know somebody asked me

454
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:31,980
once how how big is that deck going to

455
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:34,980
be as pretty simple as large as the

456
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:39,890
Wi-Fi signal reaches I mean solely

457
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,329
that's where we are so anyway begonias

458
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,429
you know again that's sort of a bonilla

459
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:46,230
kind of like oh my god a begonia but the

460
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,269
fact is wax begonias are almost

461
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,589
indestructible you know and when you're

462
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:53,849
working with people that really don't

463
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:55,349
and I said any landscapers here well

464
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,500
a few of you I won't say anything

465
00:17:55,349 --> 00:18:00,480
terribly bad but but you know

466
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,730
landscapers are a great group and they

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,589
really do enhance properties and all but

468
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,019
a lot really don't know a whole lot

469
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:08,369
about plants and so what you do is you

470
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,569
make sure they have plants that are not

471
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:11,308
going they're going to succeed with the

472
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:13,470
begonias are just a great success plan

473
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:15,089
certainly the wax begonias I like the

474
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,860
big series right now they've been really

475
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:19,649
working on it this is a Benari product

476
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,959
out of Germany and they it looks really

477
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,700
good it's a big plant and gardeners love

478
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,980
it landscapers can fill in a lot of room

479
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,269
with it the dragon wings I mean good

480
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,460
grief or whether for dragon wings we

481
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,048
wouldn't have the bonus today now

482
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,120
they're all to be sure but there's still

483
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:34,679
a fabulous seller and here it is with

484
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,119
our damn easy on the ground we know they

485
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,798
work in the baskets we know they work

486
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,139
just what anywhere in fact on the app

487
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,339
under begonias I made a special thing

488
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,320
for dragon wings because it's so

489
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,599
important but what else is happening

490
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,240
well this is what's happening and you'll

491
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:52,949
see some in the garden this afternoon

492
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,089
the pendulum of bolivian sis types but

493
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,519
don't you worry about that but the

494
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:58,139
penniless forms of begonias and there's

495
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,619
Santa Cruz and I'm going to mention

496
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,900
cultivars remember that and you should

497
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,569
know a little bit about cultivars now as

498
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,460
a consumer you don't care but as a

499
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:10,319
certainly a person in the plant world

500
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,090
you should Santa Cruz is a good one and

501
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,038
I've trialed everyone known to man and

502
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,869
then I think probably kandra's going to

503
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,019
be trialing a lot more this is the

504
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:22,709
newest called San Francisco and again

505
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:24,990
another binary product but you can see

506
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,090
how pendulums are now this is going in

507
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,259
California okay big deal I can put this

508
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,939
in George it's not going to look as good

509
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,679
as still go look pretty darn fine and

510
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,200
certainly nothing in New York this is

511
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,780
going to look terrific so this is the

512
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,730
newest one if you're interested and and

513
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,288
then you can see this other new group

514
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,919
that I think is this fabulousness this

515
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:49,589
comes out of a place called now

516
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,480
digitalis but anyway this is bossa nova

517
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,819
series so there's the Santa Cruz in San

518
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,990
Francisco group and then the bossa nova

519
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,129
group that i think are terrific now

520
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,929
there's lots of others but there's

521
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,260
something you can take a look at maybe

522
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:03,230
try one or two of these if you like them

523
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:06,058
any questions

524
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,029
if I have but one plant to put in front

525
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:11,730
of my store or one plant to put you know

526
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,960
on the door the doorway going into the

527
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,200
house it would probably some of these

528
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,549
new Rex hybrids not because of any

529
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,730
better than the others but they just

530
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:23,210
have that look that people just love so

531
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,730
here's Jurassic is a new group out of

532
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:30,569
well it's out of out of ball and then

533
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,819
Shadow King is out of green fuse both

534
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:34,678
breeders in this country and it's kind

535
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,450
of cool but the Jurassic one has gone

536
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,980
crazy they've run out of they run out of

537
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,620
plant material long before they ran out

538
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,360
of people who wanted them and the Shadow

539
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,759
King is just just finding its mark right

540
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,069
now but these are all these are all che

541
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,079
plants for foliage they don't flower

542
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:51,599
with a darn but boy do they make a

543
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,509
splash and they're easy to grow they're

544
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,279
just easy so give them something they

545
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:57,929
want they're going to spend the money

546
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,329
give them something that they're going

547
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:04,710
to be happy with parting with their

548
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:06,569
dollars i put in can is because you know

549
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,829
this tropical look as another trend it's

550
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,389
been a trend with us a long time you

551
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:11,669
know there's been a fad in a trend five

552
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,740
years so to speak you know fab last

553
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,789
three years or so a trend last five plus

554
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,808
years and maybe continues forever but

555
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,399
trend has to stop being a trend of being

556
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:22,920
real world and this is real world the

557
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,290
tropical look as real world whether it's

558
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,850
a taro or whether it's a canna it

559
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,819
doesn't I mean every annual is a

560
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:32,039
tropical and patience is tropical but

561
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:36,029
it's a tropical look that many of us are

562
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:39,539
after so this is in Montreal you should

563
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:42,990
have ahead and canna and this is a this

564
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,308
is a wasabi coleus at the Botanical

565
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,079
Garden Montreal to have a chance to get

566
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:50,399
up there boy is it spectacular place to

567
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,720
go and anyway so there's a can of pretty

568
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,150
far north so we don't have to be in a

569
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,579
south to grow these things I know that

570
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,200
ken is working with cannas there's a lot

571
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:59,399
of fabulous Canada's the foliage on

572
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Canada's can be really quite exciting

573
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,429
and of course the dark forms like

574
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,808
Australia which has been out for a

575
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:05,519
little bit but you pull Australian

576
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:07,920
remember most Candice today now are

577
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,359
grown from seed because there's a well

578
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,980
as margarine all those big virus

579
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,099
problems with Canada's and all that are

580
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,980
propagated vegetatively so if you cannot

581
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,269
get as a

582
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,539
roller you cannot get your material from

583
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:23,289
seed I'd be real careful about putting

584
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:26,470
it out there so the newest seed stuff

585
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:29,769
are these two this is a the one on the

586
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,419
top is canova and again another ball

587
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:34,569
product the terrific product there's a

588
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:37,179
mix i was at georgia trials there came

589
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:41,769
out this year and then this new one can

590
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:43,450
us all from let's say syngenta is coming

591
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:44,740
out next year there's a group this one's

592
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,259
called CLE over there's a whole group of

593
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:50,679
them coming out these are all bred to be

594
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:57,039
short okay I mean short meaning no

595
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:58,570
higher than no I'll say three feet but

596
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,619
you know give or take you're going to be

597
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:02,079
shorter here than we are in Georgia

598
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:06,519
right oh there they look good there are

599
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:08,349
diseases disease hardly any disease to

600
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,589
speak of whatsoever and so two new

601
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:12,969
groups from which to choose and again I

602
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:14,558
guess through this in because I thought

603
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,089
this was really cool it looked like a

604
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,428
bird of paradise was actually a can of

605
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,689
called bird of paradise so I thought I

606
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,940
just stuck that outside that went

607
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:26,610
outside the drive out is really cool is

608
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:31,000
it's too weird to ignore but speaking of

609
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:33,699
a little weird you know what we need

610
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,369
plants every now and then that people

611
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,740
talk about and we hope that they're as

612
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:41,199
good as the hype but we need plants that

613
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:46,839
people talk about and they are talking

614
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:48,160
about this thing digi plexus now for

615
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:50,798
those of you and of course we're here

616
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:55,750
the endemic enviros of Cornell

617
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:59,829
University you know that this is a this

618
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:01,720
is a very interesting inter generic

619
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:04,470
hybrid at least that's what they thought

620
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,360
it was this is a cross between digitalis

621
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,808
that we know and a plan from the Canary

622
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:14,678
Islands called ISIL plexus i supply i

623
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:17,168
know and and and so they called digi

624
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,679
plexus now digi plexus is a common name

625
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,480
only botanically it is now digitalis

626
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,269
okay botanically it is a digitalis

627
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,279
hybrid but the fact is this digi plexus

628
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,668
people kind of think this is neat and it

629
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,168
is neat plant as long

630
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:34,970
long as the retailers understand it is

631
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,009
an annual now certainly should be pretty

632
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,808
easy to understand in Cornell but their

633
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,999
silliness is an annual even in Atlanta

634
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:43,668
and it excuse me as a perennial even in

635
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:45,618
Atlanta it is not the Canary Islands are

636
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:49,639
not exactly the perennial capital of the

637
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:50,778
world so but it's cool anyway so people

638
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:53,058
are talking about it is a fabulous

639
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:54,648
annual it will continue to flower if you

640
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,538
cut back to full or the cut back the

641
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:58,038
spent flowers and there's a lot of

642
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,808
breeding being done on it this is

643
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,950
illumination flame was the first one but

644
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:03,079
there's three or four new ones coming

645
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,720
out very canary and a couple of others

646
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,849
it is I think it's got a three year

647
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,519
three to five year lifespan so getting

648
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:11,928
it now I just don't think it's going to

649
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,009
hang in there for a long period of time

650
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:15,109
even though they're going to continue

651
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,460
it's got some issues and certainly I

652
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:18,168
don't know if Marjorie look at it it's

653
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,028
got some disease issues for sure it is

654
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:22,580
not a digitalis as we think of a

655
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:24,470
digitalis so just be careful call it

656
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:26,418
dizzy plexus and you'll sell a ton to

657
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,749
call it and make it an annual and you

658
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:31,038
will do just fine and getting people

659
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:34,519
getting exciting I think that's a cool

660
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,980
thing I don't I don't I don't think I

661
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,499
can stand anymore sonals Ives or told

662
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,788
myself to death I trialed I tried we

663
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:43,429
started the University of Georgia trials

664
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:44,658
when 1983 82 been gone for a long time

665
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:45,859
and we've trial probably a hundred

666
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,649
different geraniums almost every year

667
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:50,028
and how has hired students that was the

668
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:54,248
best part of the whole garden I hired

669
00:25:50,028 --> 00:26:00,378
students to take care of things deadhead

670
00:25:54,249 --> 00:26:03,558
zones in August in Georgia you have a

671
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:05,089
tough student all my students were very

672
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:06,769
easily employable believe me they

673
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,148
learned out of work but I mean they're

674
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,409
they're terrific and I mean they're not

675
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,878
going to go away and there's a zillion

676
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:12,649
em out there whether it's Patriots or

677
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:15,678
lures or whatever but this is of course

678
00:26:12,648 --> 00:26:17,449
what's happening the what's happening

679
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,330
again back to the basket container thing

680
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,278
the the hybrids between the zonal and

681
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:25,699
the IV's that's been happening in the

682
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,589
last five years and Kellyanne t is one

683
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,109
that I think most of us can rely on and

684
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:32,689
you don't know what timeless is it's a

685
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:35,980
cali auntie with a new name the company

686
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:39,519
that put out timeless simply bought that

687
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,929
breeding and it's exactly the same thing

688
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,529
so that's what's happening i think the

689
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:43,759
IV's

690
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,289
are just spectacular the real

691
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,450
improvements in geranium of the hybrids

692
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:49,430
and the IV's and you're going to see a

693
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,500
lot more of those but there's also all

694
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,420
sorts of you know scented geraniums and

695
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,339
color geraniums and we'll see some of

696
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,519
the trial I know we saw some last night

697
00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:01,009
at that plantation the variegated

698
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,420
geraniums are all cool but again for the

699
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:03,920
landscaper for the person it really

700
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,500
wants a plant that's going to last all

701
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:11,380
summer and really make a show I think

702
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,380
this is where we're at my opinion I

703
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,590
mentioned last night that if I did it

704
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:21,279
planting for a dormitory like I sorry

705
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:24,799
dormitory or horas aura or eternity I

706
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,750
would use Lantana's and gomphrena so

707
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,789
anak student fell out the window they

708
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:34,099
would land on a lantana and no damage

709
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:35,960
would be done to either my antennas are

710
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:38,240
tough but so are gone freenas and these

711
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,130
are what you put in is parking lots this

712
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,289
is what you'll use in a median and a

713
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,840
roadway that gone friends are just tough

714
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,039
as nails and then you put Canada's and

715
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,679
gone freenas and everything look out

716
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,750
Lantana's and go fetus so Las Vegas are

717
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,250
short they're wonderful they do they do

718
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:56,299
well there's and that note the old gnome

719
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,859
series this is much better and again

720
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,990
there's of Las Vegas purple in Las Vegas

721
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:01,369
pink in Las Vegas weight and then this

722
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,759
is the one I think is really wonderful

723
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:07,279
if you have a gardener on your clientele

724
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,829
or a landscaper as opposed to somebody

725
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,660
just wants to throw color out there this

726
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:16,970
this is almost waist high and this is

727
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,470
fireworks and I think it's just a finest

728
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,630
conferring out there but you're not

729
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,860
going to stick hundreds of out there you

730
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,510
know this is a garden plant or a

731
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:26,629
landscape plant and I think it's

732
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:29,420
wonderful so that's again my take on

733
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,080
gomphrena except for this thing and I

734
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:35,269
won't know how many people have tried it

735
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,789
we tried this and we are we are we done

736
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:39,349
pink zazzle anybody okay Pink's hassles

737
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,000
now out there ok it was out there last

738
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:43,609
year in little limited things that's

739
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,490
been out there this year we bit for

740
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:47,839
again those garden centers or growers or

741
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,480
somebody want to try something different

742
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,849
it looks terrific it's just whether

743
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,740
tolerance is the issue in cornell here i

744
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:55,619
think in New York may be fabulous it

745
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,450
gets

746
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:59,399
little tough when it gets 24 hour south

747
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,690
but for you guys and maybe for terrific

748
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,430
and people like it that you don't like

749
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,630
it or hate it you know I I won't tell

750
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,970
too many stories but i'm from montreal

751
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,350
i'm from way the heck up there i'm in

752
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,880
georgia now okay and they keep saying

753
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:17,399
that the Canadians keep saying I are so

754
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,840
lucky must be so much fun to garden

755
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,280
almost year-round oh you know we do have

756
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,619
winter but it's still a long guarding

757
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:24,269
season and then they complain that they

758
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,219
can't grow this and can't grow that it's

759
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:28,500
too cold for this nicole for that and I

760
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,910
look at them like they're crazy it is so

761
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,549
much easier to garden in the North and

762
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:35,480
the South so much easier because in the

763
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,529
north it's either very pretty or dead

764
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,660
okay i mean it's it's there's there's

765
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:42,509
really no middle ground like it is south

766
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,220
its other's languages it hangs in there

767
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:46,829
you know and you don't want to cut it

768
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,779
because it's there but it is so much i

769
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:52,319
just spent a week in maine I mean it is

770
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:55,789
fabulous everything was fabulous so so

771
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:59,308
this may do very very well for you and

772
00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:02,399
give it a go well this is from our jury

773
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:04,410
of course this is Marjorie slides thank

774
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,240
you one of these these are on the and

775
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,550
for your your book and easier on this is

776
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,319
on the app by the way Marjorie so downy

777
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,419
mildew is not a problem give thanks you

778
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,700
know and and you know there's a

779
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,950
gazillion beddings as you know I don't

780
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,360
know I assume it's a problem here in

781
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,920
this area okay so you're probably not

782
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,959
selling much if I'm knowing not a whole

783
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,880
lot of people selling them or buying

784
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,860
them or whatever so you know that's the

785
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,540
same picture than Marjorie sent me and

786
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:32,279
and no it's a huge problem in here is

787
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,899
and you know I don't know if you'll

788
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,039
agree with me Marjorie but what I see is

789
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,769
the good news it doesn't seem to be

790
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,849
getting a whole lot worse but we still

791
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:44,990
have lots of problems so is there any

792
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:49,379
help coming with this thing and and and

793
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:52,470
whoops the good news is that there is

794
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,640
help coming you know we have margarine I

795
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,049
think you're probably talk about this

796
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,230
little bit about what's going on or

797
00:30:55,049 --> 00:31:00,149
whatever James in here graduate student

798
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,339
James Roy he's working on the breeding

799
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,840
to breed a downy mildew out of this

800
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:05,879
thing I can hardly wait to see what you

801
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,519
get so watch this kid he's going to be a

802
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,619
star and

803
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,979
so there is help coming but what do we

804
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:16,798
got today we know that the new guineas

805
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:17,940
aren't susceptible we know that we can

806
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,469
throw in the guineas but new guineas

807
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,749
aren't betting patients are just not

808
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:23,038
they're more expensive though they're

809
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:25,288
just they're just not they don't take

810
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,329
shade as well but you know that's okay

811
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:29,788
certainly the Sun patients of Sun

812
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:36,319
harmony won't work in a shady area very

813
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:44,578
well by 10 0 what do we need now well

814
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:46,200
lady Marjorie waiting larger E and we

815
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:47,908
need James and we need all the people

816
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,889
involved in this problem because boy oh

817
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:52,679
boy I don't have to tell you what a huge

818
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:57,019
problem this has become I mean a number

819
00:31:52,679 --> 00:32:01,109
one ornamental seed plant in the world

820
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:03,509
in five years con and so we need help

821
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:04,558
and and and the help is going to be from

822
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:07,378
breeding there's absolutely 0 doubt

823
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,700
about it will make sprays in this now

824
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:10,199
because this is a decent plan i'm

825
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,729
showing you this not because i'm selling

826
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,919
bounce me because i think this is as

827
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:18,690
good as what we have at the moment to

828
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:21,119
replace those bending and patience lots

829
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,239
of brakes on bounce low growing lots of

830
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:26,759
flowers and shade tolerant so I again it

831
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:29,548
is what it is we had better bergoglio's

832
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,139
we need we need better shade material we

833
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,548
need lots of lots of things and we have

834
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:34,678
lots of things you just got to try them

835
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:38,519
but for those beds where you want to

836
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,070
have a lot of color and you have partial

837
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,088
shade this might be one and again i wish

838
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:47,458
i was going to penny for every one i

839
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:54,239
sold but I'm not okay what am I going to

840
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:56,339
go to do ok no more than good ok alright

841
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,989
sweet alyssum vast and frozen start with

842
00:32:56,338 --> 00:32:59,668
snow princess there's a variegated one

843
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:02,149
is really ugly down there White Knight

844
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:05,729
don't buy it but nevertheless it's there

845
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:07,918
but this is a snow princess was the

846
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:09,749
beginning of it all and if you were an

847
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,399
old codger like me you remember sweet

848
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:12,959
alyssum mean eight they just didn't last

849
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:14,608
the summer they did they did it they

850
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:16,200
just didn't have the bigger they didn't

851
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:18,269
have anything and it's certainly going

852
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,649
to heat on them forget it but now we

853
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:22,319
have some terrific clients i think the

854
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:24,089
stream series is extraordinary

855
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,220
this is lavender stream in a basket and

856
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:30,000
here's lavender stream in the ground and

857
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,470
here's white stream over here as well so

858
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,298
I think that's a good one there's yolo's

859
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,538
come out just recently it's a new one

860
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:40,788
with a really good white so the LOB

861
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:44,398
Galleria's or whatever this thing is now

862
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:47,250
already quite good and I have to show

863
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,869
you this because while I showed you some

864
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,019
pretty pretty pictures really lovely

865
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:53,969
stuff we really do have to understand

866
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,259
there's some dogs out there I mean this

867
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,870
is ugly as sin as far as I'm concerned

868
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:00,839
but they're selling it as Tom Tom or

869
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,219
told him or something so as I was with

870
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:06,720
my friend and we were we were

871
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:09,809
disparaging this really ugly plant we

872
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,550
know that plants can't read we decided

873
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:13,108
out yesterday that plants can't read we

874
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,179
put them in areas that we shouldn't

875
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:19,500
Courtney the books most books that is

876
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:21,480
and they do just fine so as we were

877
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:26,878
saying these terrible things are not

878
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:33,210
sure that plants can't hear because as

879
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:35,929
we were walking away it was saying it

880
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,929
was number one

881
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,220
always have fun with this stuff always

882
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:43,750
have fun you know truly do not take any

883
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,668
of this stuff seriously because this is

884
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,039
like people love this stuff so you know

885
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:50,529
whether whether they can hear or not who

886
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,119
knows but it's fun it really is fun I'll

887
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,460
just finish off this annual thing with a

888
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,858
few terrific rudbeckia is I think the

889
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,599
tiger eyes are extraordinary denver

890
00:34:56,858 --> 00:35:01,029
daisy has been a real good one from osu

891
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,410
a big flower seems to do well and the

892
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,019
Prairie son just won't go away it's just

893
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:07,539
a good plan so the annual Rebecca's are

894
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:10,809
really quite terrific really quite

895
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:13,630
terrific the ornamental foliage ones

896
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,769
such as alternate there's ma'am and this

897
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,838
foliage is where it's at right now

898
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:18,789
here's Brazilian red hot but if you have

899
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:21,099
one plant to buy for foliage for your

900
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:23,500
landscapers get this one this is little

901
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,269
Ruby it is it is low growing it's not

902
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,989
more than six to eight inches tall it

903
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:30,880
stays that color all season and it is

904
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:33,368
just that the extraordinary plan and

905
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440
it's an alternate IRA copper leaf which

906
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:39,099
nobody knows what to do with anyway but

907
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,740
full Sun it does very very well Coley I

908
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:44,859
are never going to go away no bill is so

909
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,929
excited we got some saw Salina stemming

910
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:48,848
okay which is what your coleus work

911
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:50,889
would call we knew most coleus now

912
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,720
they're all of a sudden a seminar so

913
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,730
that's something they're not even that

914
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,079
any more than all now plectranthus for

915
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,699
what it's worth so there's no such thing

916
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,809
as Cole there's no such thing as salinas

917
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:01,239
them and now they're all plectranthus

918
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:04,389
who cares certainly my daughter doesn't

919
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:07,299
but they're great plants so I Stepan

920
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:09,338
Newfoundland so we can I mean it's

921
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,080

926
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,659
annuals everyone likes wine it's a lady

935

every darn finger you know they just

937
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,750

950
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,010
him die so he can get something new next

951
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:32,539
year but they do need heat to get going

952
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,550
there's no doubt about it they need to

953
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,110
heat to get going but that whole

954
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,480
tropical look thing you know on how you

955
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:40,400

963
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:58,639

969
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:15,319
from from annuals you can see in my hand

970
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:16,940
out I got a ton of perennials that

971
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,539
you're just not going to hear about but

972
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,280
some other time I'm going to take a

973
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:25,239
little trending look at this vegetable

974
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,240
thing too and

975
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:33,708
I think again when when things were

976
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:36,289
really rough veggies helped an awful lot

977
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:38,208
of people people always love vegetables

978
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:40,400
it used to be that we could say that

979
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:42,889
women like flowers and men love

980
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,630
vegetables but but that's no longer the

981
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:47,328
case I think the vegetables are just

982
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,130
everybody wants vegetables today and let

983
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:53,239
me tell you again that you do not have

984
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:55,880
to believe a word I say the garden of

985
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,318
tomorrow is the deck and that's where

986
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,079
we're going to be selling vegetables for

987
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:01,219
we're still going to have vegetable

988
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,469
gardens we're still going to have

989
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:04,579
tomatoes taller than I am we're still

990
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:07,099
going to have all that stuff that's not

991
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:10,818
going to go away but if we're thinking

992
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:12,318
of getting my neighbor your friends you

993
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:14,449
know you know you guys if you go look if

994
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:15,829
you go to a gathering and you're just

995
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:17,599
talking with neighbors and friends or

996
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:21,219
whatever and then somebody comes up and

997
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,630
starts talking about plugs and cultivars

998
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:26,298
you know you turn around and those 10

999
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,910
people that were there it's just you two

1000
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:32,719
left they don't want to hear about this

1001
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:34,338
right so but vegetables everybody wants

1002
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,039
vegetables so what are we doing in

1003
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,748
vegetables these days this is a major

1004
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,880
trend I have absolutely no doubt good

1005
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:43,038
vegetables will keep going you know the

1006
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,959
big names are in there okay whether it's

1007
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,209
Burpee or whether it's ball or whether

1008
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:50,118
it used to be that you had some seed

1009
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:51,618
veggies now all the major breeders that

1010
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:53,869
we're breeding caliber colas are now

1011
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:56,749
breeding vegetables this is a good thing

1012
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:58,999
because they have the distribution means

1013
00:39:56,748 --> 00:40:00,919
to get these out to you the garden

1014
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:02,928
centers now you're still going to buy

1015
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,479
your seed for whatever I don't care but

1016
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:06,829
this is an opportunity now for you to

1017
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:09,768
get some of the newer materials that are

1018
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:11,839
coming down easily you know and then you

1019
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:13,698
know on a the places like the burpees in

1020
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,558
the balls and the Syngenta's and the

1021
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:17,900
whoever is they going to give you p 0 p

1022
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,209
material if you want it and for the

1023
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,410
landscapers in the gardener's this is

1024
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:23,778
the information that they're going to

1025
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:26,358
get instead of oil that's a pretty good

1026
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:28,429
tomato I don't know if it has wilt or

1027
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:32,389
not and there's lots of interesting

1028
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:34,219
things going on grafted vegetables now

1029
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:35,538
again I I don't want to believe with

1030
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:37,278
this grafted vegetable thing that

1031
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:39,979
happens to me me and those vegetables

1032
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:42,519
are probably well he'll tall I am those

1033
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:45,019
are my tomatoes last year okay

1034
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,489
there's no doubt the grafted vegetables

1035
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:49,789
like the graph the tomatoes grafted I

1036
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:55,069
call this thing it's it's a it's from a

1037
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:56,840
company in California and call ppl and

1038
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,220
they're doing everything it's cool and

1039
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,200
the nice thing about graft it is you get

1040
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:02,239
a group stock that's much more disease

1041
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,269
resistant and much more vigorous to save

1042
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,259
a Brandywine tomato that you want it but

1043
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:08,809
you don't get a lot yield you'll get

1044
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,000
more yield much more expensive so you

1045
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:13,099
guys in a garden trade in the landscape

1046
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,440
trade you might are in the retail trade

1047
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:18,440
might not be able to sell that many

1048
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,829
because a tomato myself for 398 and the

1049
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,150
cells for 1398 so what who cares it's an

1050
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:25,610
opportunity so you want to get a few in

1051
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:29,090
people are talking about it those are my

1052
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:31,099
tomatoes but I so sort so combo colored

1053
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,990
seat offers are happening to like this

1054
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:35,119
multi pellets is a fusible for the

1055
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:38,359
growers in the audience then what we get

1056
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,130
is we get a plug that comes into this

1057
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,470
wrong way to get this plug that has two

1058
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,329
or three seed materials in it different

1059
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,279
lettuces different whatever's plunk it

1060
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:48,920
in a thing and now you've got now you've

1061
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,000
got this wonderful combination you're

1062
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,039
going to see call you're going to see

1063
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,530
combinations this afternoon they're

1064
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,329
going to knock your socks off of

1065
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:58,250
vegetables and herbs and colorful plants

1066
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:01,429
but this is where we're at i think as

1067
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,260
far as this and lots of breeding and

1068
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:05,389
selection for this patio thing this is

1069
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,800
our University of Georgia we started

1070
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,379
this 10 years ago we started working

1071
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,750
with vegetal us and few others to see

1072
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,329
what was out there and you know this is

1073
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:17,119
what's happening this may never ever

1074
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:20,150
looked like this in your garden it

1075
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,710
doesn't look like that in my garden but

1076
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,539
nevertheless these are this is a son of

1077
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,550
things that we're looking at or that the

1078
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:28,730
companies are looking at you know grape

1079
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,900
type vines on tomatoes and these are

1080
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,519
available by the way anybody wants to

1081
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,289
try them and if you're a tomato

1082
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,949
aficionado give them a go there there

1083
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:39,829
there absolutely available but not just

1084
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:40,969
big things but shorter more prolific

1085
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,340
plants and again you're going to see

1086
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:44,779
those this afternoon for the tomato

1087
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,309
whether it's neat and sweet or this big

1088
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,160
league I think it's wonderful we're

1089
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:50,719
going to see some really cool tomatoes

1090
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:54,170
this afternoon as well they've been bred

1091
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,609
for the patio so big fruit small plants

1092
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,039
if we can get that

1093
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:00,380
tomatoes by the way there's vegetables

1094
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:02,779
and there's Tomatoes okay I mean truly I

1095
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,970
mean it's it's like it's like a whole

1096
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,410
different world is I mean when people

1097
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:11,269
ask about vegetables are usually Haskell

1098
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:13,789
tomatoes and if we can go a good tomato

1099
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:17,509
we're doing okay so lots of cool things

1100
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:19,789
happening it seems that everyone a

1101
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,980
mental breeder is doing veggies again

1102
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:25,460
this is it i think is syngenta this is

1103
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:28,309
all the Asian vegetables this is from

1104
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,650
taki in Japan there praying Asian

1105
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:32,150
vegetables to the consumer actually to

1106
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,950
you the garden center or to use a

1107
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,809
landscaper so you can put Asian

1108
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:39,109
vegetables in there are new cultivars of

1109
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:43,009
which go very very very strong and our

1110
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:44,480
wonderful the herb tray is exploding for

1111
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,160
what it's worth on the app I've just

1112
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,929
partnered with the american herb society

1113
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:51,969
and we're going to put herbs on this app

1114
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:54,379
as well because they are exploding so

1115
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:55,969
guys that's this is where these are the

1116
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,869
trends there's no doubt about it and i

1117
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:00,139
don't know what to do with this stuff

1118

1121
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,309

1124
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:21,739
hula bit anyway it's like it's like

1125
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,030
Brazel berries and all these other kind

1126
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:25,189
of things where we're getting fruit in a

1127
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,840
container and it's kind of neat so you

1128
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,929
might not like it doesn't matter who

1129
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,579

1130
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:34,940
that's where we are these are the trends

1131
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:37,969
that are happening and so it's always

1132
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,440
fun to see what's going on eggplants big

1133
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:41,750
in containers i think eggplants are

1134
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,909
really very very ornamental plants they

1135
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,739
truly are there are some eggplants in

1136
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:47,929
Chicago Botanic Garden eggplants with

1137
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:49,339
petunias in our garden so it's just a

1138
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:50,629
real versatile plant and there's

1139
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,370
eggplants over here to guard you're

1140
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,200

1142

black there's polka-dotted I don't what

1143
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,450
you do with an eggplant by truth I can't

1144
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:04,430
think I think am I not a big egg plant

1145
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:09,538
guy but they look nice

1146
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:13,288
they look nice and this was a somebody

1147
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:15,960
in in Ohio who kinda I thought this was

1148
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:17,549
cool they put together towers for

1149
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,909
potatoes I want to grow potatoes I don't

1150
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:23,759
have a space so I put together a tower

1151
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:25,379
with with all sorts of soil and pine

1152
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:27,778
straw and whatever and plugged her

1153
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,660
tomatoes in our potatoes in and she had

1154
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:32,179
a nice yield the potatoes and also the

1155
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:35,338
same gardener I thought was fantastic

1156
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:39,389
look at these darn things I mean I mean

1157
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:41,788
this is terrific so so people are going

1158
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:45,509
to be a whole lot smarter and I say real

1159
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:46,799
people a lot smaller than we are ok

1160
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,269
they're going to do whatever it is

1161
00:45:46,798 --> 00:45:50,639
they're going to need to do but you got

1162
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:53,848
to give them the good plants and and so

1163
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:59,308
I think this was really cool and more

1164
00:45:53,849 --> 00:46:05,609
power this is Oberlin Ohio and in fact

1165
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:07,528
that person is quite a gardener but you

1166
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:10,619
know working and she got no more time

1167
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:11,789
than you or I do so anyway this is son

1168
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:14,970

1184
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:00,889

1196
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:25,849
produced a lot of small fruit and fruit

1197
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,380
