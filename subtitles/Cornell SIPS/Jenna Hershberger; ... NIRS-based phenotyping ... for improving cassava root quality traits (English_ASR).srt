1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,769
okay thanks Jacob and sorry for them

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:16,859
mouthful of a title I shortened it a

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:19,710
little bit for here but oh well okay so

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,110
building off of what Evan said about

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,660
cassava already I'll just jump right in

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,660
some of the major cassava breeding

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,320
targets that the programs in the

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,780
next-gen group work on our pest and

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,520
disease resistance sorry about the I

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,509
need to figure out how to hold this

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,659
better okay

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:43,108
including CBS D or cassava Brown Street

15
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:45,960
disease this is the root on the left and

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,899
then cassava mosaic virus which is a

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,030
mosaicing on the leaf here yield and

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,239
field performance so the number of roots

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,670
per plant on the size of the roots shown

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,558
here and then quality traits and these

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,359
are all part of the selection indices

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,939
that are used by the breeding programs

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,420
today I'm going to focus mostly on this

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,039
quality trade part and the actual

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,040
measurement that's put into the

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,710
selection index is the root dry matter

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
content this is the percent of the root

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,849
that's not water and that's calculated

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,950
by the dry weight over the fresh wait

30
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,759
times hundred percent it's a major

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,930
component of the dry yield and the food

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,740
quality so it factors in to needs of

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,300
both processors farmers and consumers

34
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:35,069
it's typically ranges from twenty to

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,569
forty five percent with the higher the

36
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,250
better the twenty percent is not

37
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,949
something you'd actually want to eat or

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,569
grow and it's not uniform within the

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,350
root which is something I'll come back

40
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:49,139
to later the dry matter contents mostly

41
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:53,729
made up of starches carbohydrates with

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,519
some protein fiber ash lipids as well so

43
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,439
though it's so important for reading

44
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:02,609
programs it's time-consuming and

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,219
laborious to measure so in Uganda the

46
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:09,209
roots are graded by hand they're dried

47
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,459
in big ovens and when you consider that

48
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,859
there could be thousands of plots per

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,930
breeding program per season and limited

50
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:19,079
electricity that could make the ovens go

51
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,560
offline and then off-site trials that

52
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,450
you have to try

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,530
sport the roots back and forth that

54
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:27,899
creates a lot of work so the goal is to

55
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,848
reduce the amount of work that braiding

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,099
programs have to do each season and

57
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:33,899
that's where near-infrared spectroscopy

58
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,419
comes in and this has been used before

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,640
in cassava but I'll explain a little bit

60
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,109
about what it is so this is looking at

61
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,238
the reflectance in the near infrared

62
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,140
region of the electromagnetic spectrum

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,170
this is 780 to 2500 nanometers so just

64
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,439
beyond the visible it's measured by

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,969
using an active light source that emits

66
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,549
wavelengths in this range on a

67
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,979
biological sample and then the sample

68
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,790
itself changes the reflectance pattern

69
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,979
that's sensed by a sensor and so this is

70
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,348
what cassava looks like when you scan it

71
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,598
with a near infrared spectrometer so we

72
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:14,009
see reflectance on the y axis and

73
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,719
wavelengths on the X and this tells us

74
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,429
about the chemical and physical

75
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,500
properties of the sample that was

76
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,269
scanned but the signal that comes back

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,489
is complex and so it requires

78
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,519
multivariate statistical techniques to

79
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,680
decipher what's actually going on but

80
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,379
once you have models calibrated for the

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,680
traits of interest you can measure these

82
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,419
traits quickly and non-destructively so

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,459
like I said it's been used before in

84
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,298
cassava to look at dry matter content in

85
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,599
roots this has been done first of all

86
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,180
with the 6500 this is a benchtop model

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,549
that's been shown to be highly

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,340
predictive of dry matter content so

89
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,170
above 0.94 in the literature and then we

90
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,150
have a spectral range here that includes

91
00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:00,899
some some of the visible range as well

92
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:07,469
from 420 580 meters the next generation

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:09,810
was from EK sorry Google Yahoo from John

94
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:12,209
Luke's lab and he looked at this mobile

95
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,579
spectrometer the quality spectra it has

96
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,108
an even larger spectral range but the

97
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,569
predictive ability dropped a little bit

98
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,620
in his tests to 0.8 which is still

99
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:24,990
pretty good and it passed the standards

100
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,509
for breeders but the problem with these

101
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,848
two units is they're really expensive

102
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,800
and for a small breeding program this

103
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:35,889
might be way out of the budget you could

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,228
extra workers you could put extra field

105
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,629
plots do more trials for this amount of

106
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:42,908
money so for these reasons we've been

107
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,000
looking into the CEO which is a small

108
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:49,240
hand handheld spectrometer that's only

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,129
three hundred dollars per unit but it

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,319
does have a smaller spectral range and

111
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:58,389
this this means that we need to evaluate

112
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,069
the performance of the spectrometer

113
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,769
before we can fully recommend it to

114
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,379
breeding programs in order to do that we

115
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,750
collect calibration data so scans from

116
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,918
the spectrometer paired with these oven

117
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,408
measurements that I was talking about

118
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,299
before we use those as input for

119
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:15,370
prediction model development and once we

120
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,020
have models that pass our standards we

121
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,389
can use them routinely in breeding

122
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,370
programs but to get to that point we

123
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,129
need to optimize the protocols that

124
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,189
we're using both in actual sampling of

125
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:29,439
the roots and in model development and

126
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,908
then we do need to keep going back and

127
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,279
making sure that our models are still

128
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:35,829
appropriate as our populations change we

129
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,408
have three generations so the

130
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:41,228
calibration data collection looks like

131
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:44,259
selecting several routes for plot and

132
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:48,879
then slicing them so this you have three

133
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:51,129
different slice points and that is that

134
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,918
is so that we can cover the variation

135
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,899
within the route these route slices are

136
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,788
each scanned with the spectrometer and

137
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,500
then we take a mean plot dry matter

138
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:01,120
content measurement using the oven

139
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,278
method that I talked about earlier and

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,829
these scans are paired with these

141
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:08,408
measurements and those go into our

142
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:10,149
prediction models so these are the

143
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:12,639
populations that I've been working with

144
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:15,788
so far the dry matter content varies

145
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,310
pretty widely both within and among both

146
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:21,339
trials and breeding programs I want to

147
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,500
point out a couple things here first is

148
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:26,439
these two trials a timber Appa and

149
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,598
Brazil are seedling evaluation trials

150
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,000
and if you talk to any cassava breeder

151
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:34,000
you'll know that seedling evaluation

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,250
trials from true seed are not always

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,439
indicative of what the plant will

154
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,250
actually do when you take a clonally a

155
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,569
clonal probably from it so we see a wide

156
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,309
range of dry matter content in those two

157
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,199
these two trials from my ITA are

158
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:51,779
actually the same genotypes grown in two

159
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,419
different years so we do see a lot of

160
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:58,618
variation due to environment here and

161
00:06:54,418 --> 00:07:00,868
then this trial at nakri is has a low

162
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:05,009
tail here for dry matter content and

163
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:07,679
that is because of CBS d incidents in

164
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,360
Uganda so that's those disease routes

165
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,588
from that first slide that I showed and

166
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:18,270
that really affects the dry matter

167
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:20,189
content of okay so once we have these

168
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,468
oven dry matter content measurements

169
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:25,499
paired with our scans we can use those

170
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:27,329
to create prediction models so I divide

171
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:30,059
them into training and test sets and

172
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:31,978
then use five fold cross validation and

173
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:34,409
partially to tune partially squares

174
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,748
model parameters with the training set

175
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:39,498
and then use the optimized model to

176
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:42,149
predict our training star test set I

177
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:44,490
output model performance statistics like

178
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:48,079
R squared root mean squared error and

179
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:52,649
then I repeat this with different

180
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,448
subsets of training and test sets so

181
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:56,999
when we look at performance within

182
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,819
breeding programs so that's the diagonal

183
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:02,879
this is not a correlation matrix it is a

184
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,189
training set on the y-axis test set on

185
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,338
the X this is whole breeding program

186
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:12,689
performance so we can see up in the top

187
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:16,709
left is using AIT a data to predict AIT

188
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:19,588
a data and then so on so this is in 2018

189
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:24,418
we see that model performance is pretty

190
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:28,228
high we got a 0.85 r squared with a 2.6

191
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:31,408
our MSE for i-i-i-t a and then going

192
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:33,899
down there but the real test would be to

193
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:35,729
see how the models perform when your

194
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,519
training on one breeding program and

195
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,329
testing another so can we train models

196
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:45,929
at iit a and test them in rwanda say

197
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:48,000
answer is mixed back we have some models

198
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:52,349
doing really well like using the

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,990
improper data to predict the plots at

200
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,120
nakri but then when you use iit a we're

201
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,169
getting poor performance predicting

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,679
either of the other breeding

203
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:04,078
programs this is a little concerning but

204
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,479
again we could just train models for

205
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,399
each individual breeding program ideally

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,860
though we would use everything we have

207
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:17,399
and training like a major model and then

208
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,990
use that to test everything and so when

209
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,360
we do that we actually see the

210
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,659
performance go back up which is pretty

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,050
great so this is really comparable to

212
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:30,740
this diagonal here we only lose a very

213
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:34,919
small amount of our predictive ability

214
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,139
but in order to make these big models

215
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,599
using everything we have we have to be

216
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,070
able to put everything together in one

217
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,050
place

218
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,820
so this is where cassava base comes in

219
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,669
I've been working with Lukas Mueller's

220
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,680
group to create the infrastructure to

221
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:52,828
store an access spectral data within

222
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:56,549
cassava base this will allow for us to

223
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:59,399
take training and test sets from any any

224
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:03,509
trial within the database and then use

225
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,429
them to build and evaluate models so the

226
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,948
functions that I've been writing and

227
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:11,039
using from my own work we're putting

228
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:16,469
into cassava base for use by any breeder

229
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:18,360
and then they can build evaluate their

230
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,100
own models and use them for prediction

231
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,230
and then the predicted value is can be

232
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,490
used for selection in the selection

233
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,170
indices I've been talking about so

234
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,509
that's our plan moving forward but I'd

235
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:35,578
really like to thank all of the next-gen

236
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:37,409
cassava breeding programs Gore lab the

237
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:39,659
pheno apps team my committee and then

238
00:10:37,409 --> 00:11:05,759
the funding from the Vino apps project

239
00:10:39,659 --> 00:11:11,360
so that I'll take questions yeah Evan so

240
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,360
by combining - you mean two programs or

241
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:25,419
yeah so um here what I did is trained on

242
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:28,480
two programs and like 70% of the third

243
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:31,209
and then tests on that 30% hold out so I

244
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,909
haven't tried training a model on say

245
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,230
IIT and a Korean predicting Embrapa but

246
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:49,000
that's definitely something that I could

247
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:52,330
do yeah so for here I'm just training it

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,039
on the spectra but I do have a test

249
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,220
plots from all of the environments

250
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,250
included in the training set so I also

251
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,529
have done cross validation schemes that

252
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,370
hold out an entire environment or

253
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:09,250
specific genotypes and those as you'd

254
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:17,700
expect perform a little more poorly than

255
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:17,700
these do yeah it is pretty exciting

256
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:43,870
yeah so the question was could I subset

257
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:46,809
the data from the spectrometers with a

258
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,679
larger range to my smaller range and

259
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:52,750
compare how they do compared to this one

260
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,659
yes we actually did that before starting

261
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,330
with Lugo's data is take a subset from

262
00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:01,659
740 to 1070 nanometers which is the

263
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,190
Visayas range and saw pretty high

264
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:05,379
performance I don't remember the exact

265
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,770
numbers at the top of my head but in the

266
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:11,679
high point eats for dry matter content

267
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:13,750
we we also looked at carotenoid content

268
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,729
for that and so it was as expected

269
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,440
pretty low because most of the signal

270
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,509
for carotenoids is in the visible range

271
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,850
which is outside the range of the SIA so

272
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:24,139
that's why we went ahead and moved

273
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,930
forward with the dry matter content

274
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:32,620
thank you are there any questions over

275
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:32,620
zoom okay well thank you very much Jenna
