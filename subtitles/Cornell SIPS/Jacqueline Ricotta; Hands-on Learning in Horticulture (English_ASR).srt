1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,059
today we'll be talking about hands-on

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,000
learning in horticulture but first and

5
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:16,730
Steve did point this out there we go um

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,559
we are in pen even though our name is

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:23,300
Delaware Valley we are in Pennsylvania I

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,089
put a big star up here for of course

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,800
this is Cornell we are down here in

10
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:30,079
Doylestown this is Bucks County

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,929
Pennsylvania this is Philadelphia and

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,689
interestingly enough we are just about

13
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:38,030
as far from Cornell as we are from Penn

14
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:41,718
State so I'm gonna be coming north

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,910
rather than west from now on so I can't

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,600
talk about hands-on learning and

17
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:50,179
teaching in horticulture without

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,929
discussing some of the work from Liberty

19
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:53,269
High Bailey

20
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:55,698
of course since I've been here I spent a

21
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,430
lot of time reading about Liberty hi

22
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:59,960
Bailey looking at all his portraits and

23
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:03,289
I thought this was particularly

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,719
interesting he wrote a book back in 1910

25
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,510
talked called the training of farmers

26
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,539
and he said I regard certain kinds of

27
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,000
demonstration work on farms as of the

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,759
greatest teaching value if it is

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,859
conducted by a good teacher and this

30
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,478
quote really struck home with me because

31
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:26,328
we we definitely use our teaching farms

32
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:29,359
at Del Vale we use the farms in region

33
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:33,649
and it's really important to the faculty

34
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:35,989
at del val to be good teachers we for

35
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:38,960
the most part do very little research we

36
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:41,839
are not we don't have to publish papers

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,078
most of us do not have big research

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,280
programs we don't have to unless we want

39
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:52,099
to apply for grants what we do is teach

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,728
and so and I'll talk about that through

41
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:58,158
the seminar so it's really important

42
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:01,849
also to know a little bit of about the

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:06,229
history of del val it was actually

44
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:09,680
founded in 1896 as the national farm

45
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:12,409
school and so this is this is Rabbi

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,599
Joseph Kraus coffe and this is actually

47
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,969
on one of the original buildings that is

48
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,599
now still honor

49
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:22,729
campus but what's really interesting is

50
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,829
how this all came about and believe it

51
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:28,909
or not there's actually connections to

52
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:32,030
Cornell in the history of del Val

53
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:38,569
so hopefully everybody recognizes Andrew

54
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:41,389
Dixon white here in about 1887 Joseph

55
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:45,530
Krause coughed was the the rabbi he was

56
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:48,529
the leader of a large Jewish synagogue

57
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,349
in Philadelphia called kinetise Israel

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,870
and krauskopf was really known as a

59
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,349
social reformer he was very

60
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:01,640
forward-thinking on the role of women on

61
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:03,859
the the need for for social programs and

62
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:07,159
he addressed these issues in his writing

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:12,170
he was again very well known at that

64
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:14,750
time in 1894 he actually wrote to Andrew

65
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:19,399
Dixon white who was the ambassador to

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:22,699
Russia okay and it was because of Andrew

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,750
Dixon white putting him in touch with

68
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:29,869
count Leo Tolstoy that Rabbi krauskopf

69
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,709
met with Leo Tolstoy and Tolstoy

70
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,140
actually told him return to America and

71
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:39,019
lead the tens of thousands from your

72
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:43,309
congested cities to your idle fertile

73
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:47,390
lands what krauskopf spoke to Tolstoy

74
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,360
about was his worries his concerns for

75
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:52,339
many of the Jewish immigrants coming to

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,910
the United States he was especially

77
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,840
worried about the Jewish youth coming

78
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:01,639
over and not having jobs and the the

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,989
anti-semitism that they were beginning

80
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:10,069
to see so again this was a seminal

81
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:13,400
moment in the in the genesis of del val

82
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:18,790
and krauskopf actually wrote about it in

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:22,220
my visit to Tolstoy interestingly the

84
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,530
friendship and this is just an aside the

85
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,240
friendship between Andrew Dixon white

86
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:30,859
and Joseph Krause cough continued in

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,129
1906 white actually

88
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:38,840
came to Philadelphia and he gave the

89
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:42,229
keynote speech a dedication of a stained

90
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,008
glass window that was being installed in

91
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,218
kanessa

92
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:49,520
Kenneth us-israel in Philadelphia this

93
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:52,728
is this is a photograph of that the

94
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,399
window was dedicated to the Secretary of

95
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:59,300
State John Hayes who apparently Andrew

96
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:01,188
Dixon white knew very well and in one of

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,340
the publications I was reading he gave a

98
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:07,490
wonderful speech about this and so this

99
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:10,158
friendship between krauskopf and Andrew

100
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,439
Dixon white continued for many years

101
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:14,449
I've actually well being on sabbatical

102
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:18,560
here at Cornell's have spent some time

103
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:21,770
in the archives down in Olin library

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,680
which is an amazing place and these are

105
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:28,038
some of the letters that I found this is

106
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,579
from these two set of correspondences

107
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:34,519
this is from Joseph Krause cough and

108
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:37,668
this is actually from Andrew Dixon white

109
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:42,758
it's a it's a multiple page letter back

110
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:45,769
to Krause cough and I I wanted to read

111
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,750
it's hard to for you to see right here

112
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:50,359
but you could tell that there was an

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,180
affection between the two men crossed us

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,788
says in his letter with kindest regards

115
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,310
to your dear wife and daughter who I had

116
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,918
the pleasure of meeting at our temple in

117
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,978
all of which mrs. Krause Cobb heartily

118
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:07,038
joins me I remain with sentiments of

119
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:09,468
esteem very Sincerely Yours Joseph cross

120
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:13,399
cough so there there was this connection

121
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:15,408
between dehl Val and Cornell but so

122
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,489
let's get back to teaching and learning

123
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:23,168
when krauskopf got back from Russia what

124
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,759
he did was he what he learned from

125
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:28,218
Tolstoy was that there should be science

126
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,710
with practice and so Krauss cough came

127
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:32,870
back and he bought hundreds of acres of

128
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:36,079
land in Bucks County Pennsylvania and

129
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,939
you can see an aerial photograph of what

130
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,129
it looks like and of course this is what

131
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:43,580
kind of a more modern schematic of what

132
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:44,168
campus looks like today from the hundred

133
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:46,180
or so

134
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:49,658
years that krauskopf started with he

135
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,199
bought more and more and more and over

136
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:55,509
the years del val has been gifted with

137
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:59,499
farms so we actually have a wealth of

138
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:03,400
acreage we have three separate farms and

139
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:05,860
over a thousand acres of farmland which

140
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:09,329
enforced land which we have orchards and

141
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,580
we have vegetable crops and animals and

142
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:16,269
pastures and everything that that an Ag

143
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:19,508
school might have so the National farm

144
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,549
school changed through the years in 1948

145
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:25,658
it became the natural National

146
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,759
Agricultural College in 1960 it actually

147
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:30,310
became Delaware Valley College of

148
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,528
Science and Agriculture somewhere along

149
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,899
the way they dropped the science and

150
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:38,348
agriculture and we were just for many

151
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,628
years Delaware Valley College we added

152
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:45,519
buildings and as again as I said we

153
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:48,789
added farms and it was in 2014 that the

154
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:52,120
college became a university and so what

155
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:54,818
we are today is about 1,700

156
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,069
undergraduates we have about 300

157
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,319
graduate students but all of our

158
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:02,710
graduate programs are in business and

159
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:05,039
education and we now have a couple of

160
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:07,598
smaller programs in criminal justice and

161
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:11,408
policy studies we actually do not have

162
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:15,009
graduate programs in any of the sciences

163
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:18,550
but there are about 25 majors and once

164
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:22,149
Daleville became a university we broke

165
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,968
up into three separate colleges so AG

166
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:26,680
and environmental sciences business in

167
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:30,399
humanities and life and physical

168
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,948
sciences and of course I am and part of

169
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,889
the AG and environmental science College

170
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:38,490
at Dell Vale so we have about 90 total

171
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:41,198
faculty which is really interesting and

172
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,159
as I understand that there's about 90

173
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:47,139
total faculty here in six at Cornell so

174
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,719
it's just been really wonderful to know

175
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:52,629
that that you know I'm surrounded by so

176
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,639
many people who love plants as much as

177
00:08:52,629 --> 00:09:01,289
as much as I do so the science with prac

178
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:04,389
that historical way that Krauss

179
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:07,089
co-founded the National farm school has

180
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,539
stayed with us through all of these

181
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:12,970
years and all of these changes

182
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:16,289
historically so when I began in 2000

183
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:20,560
students had the requirements of working

184
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:23,679
900 hours in their field before they

185
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,379
could graduate and so over the years

186
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:30,489
that's changed slightly and we now have

187
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:33,460
what is called the e360 program or the

188
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,090
experience 360 program and a hundred

189
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,580
percent of our students graduate with

190
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:42,790
experience in the field that they want

191
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,400
to go into so you cannot major in

192
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:49,269
something without having worked in that

193
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:53,799
field and along with the actual work

194
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:59,409
experience we have classes that go along

195
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:01,919
with a 360 that that require that the

196
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:05,589
students actually reflect on their work

197
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:08,319
experiences so it's not just doing a job

198
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:11,110
it's reflecting on wow did I like this

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,480
job just my personality suited to this

200
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,240
job is this something I think I can do

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,450
long term so it's really developed into

202
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,600
an entire program and the experience is

203
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,730
that the the student received through

204
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,920
this e360 program actually go on their

205
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:31,269
transcripts so it's something that they

206
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:34,839
can present to an employer part of the

207
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:37,419
work experience that Daleville students

208
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,910
are required to have can be done on

209
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,009
campus and I think this is one of the

210
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:45,459
things I've noted that might be a little

211
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:48,639
different than here is we have we have a

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,740
few farm managers but by and large the

213
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,740
work on the farms is done by student

214
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,529
employees and so these are actually

215
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:01,019
students who are working we have

216
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:04,629
orchards we have a apple sorting

217
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,340
equipment we have a cider press and so

218
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:10,659
the students are the ones who are

219
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,000
working on the farms providing much of

220
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:14,299
the

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,230
that's needed to keep all this acreage

222
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:23,029
going in the plant sciences at Del Vale

223
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,370
we are actually split up into two

224
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,559
different departments and similarly to

225
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,549
what has happened here you know there's

226
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:34,639
been this this change in our we one

227
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:37,459
department are we two are we three but

228
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,100
right now this is where we are I'm in

229
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,100
the Department of Plant Sciences we have

230
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:47,450
around a hundred and five students and

231
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,040
we have majors in all of these areas so

232
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,700
there's a horticulture major a

233
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:55,639
sustainable AG major a turf major crop

234
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,710
science and then our organic farming

235
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,759
certificate which I'll talk about in a

236
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,769
few minutes

237
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,159
landscape architecture and environmental

238
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:06,529
sciences is just a little bit smaller

239
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:10,579
and you can major in environmental

240
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,199
science you can actually do a landscape

241
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,580
architecture degree which we have a

242
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:19,940
Delvaux alum who is here now getting her

243
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,550
mla and our program is an accredited

244
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,770
landscape architecture program which is

245
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:27,289
really has been a benefit since the

246
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,019
student who's here now was able to cut a

247
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:34,009
semester out of her program because of

248
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:37,759
coming through this program we have lots

249
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:40,338
of different facilities on campus one of

250
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,980
the things that's really popular and

251
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,870
this is actually part of the

252
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,860
horticulture major is we have both

253
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:53,089
hydroponics and aquaponics on campus and

254
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,860
and we were able to retrofit some of our

255
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:59,030
greenhouses because of an extremely

256
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:02,029
large for us donation and so this now is

257
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:05,120
somewhere that students work there's a

258
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:07,809
class around this and then the lettuce

259
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,519
that produce is produced shows up in our

260
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:16,009
cafeteria we also have as I mentioned

261
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,049
lots of trees the campus itself is

262
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:21,889
considered to be the Henry Schneider

263
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:24,309
Arboretum and so almost all of our trees

264
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:27,278
and our shrubs are laid

265
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:30,998
so you you know what everything is in an

266
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,159
in our Arbor culture class students are

267
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,980
actually taught so this is this is a

268
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:39,519
class this is an actual student they're

269
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,889
taught to climb trees and and which is

270
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,808
is something that someone who going out

271
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,240
into the world to be an arbor

272
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:50,039
culturalist might need to know and then

273
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,049
are generally in our laes department

274
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:56,139
what we are involved in is the

275
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:57,998
Philadelphia Flower Show which is every

276
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:01,089
March it's one of the largest flower

277
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:04,930
shows in the country and there's actual

278
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:07,180
class that students take in the fall

279
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:10,508
semester where they design the display

280
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:13,179
for the Flower Show and then in the

281
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:15,970
spring semester they actually build as

282
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:18,219
much as they can on campus and then are

283
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,740
responsible for taking it down to Philly

284
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,649
to the convention center and assembling

285
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,519
and painting and doing everything but

286
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:30,429
the display needs advising is also

287
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,308
really important at so avail one of the

288
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:36,429
things that we have in place is it's

289
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:38,969
called a hold on the student accounts a

290
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:42,508
student cannot register for classes

291
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:45,278
unless they've seen their advisor and

292
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:49,089
what that means is that when once the

293
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:53,198
advisor has met with the student then we

294
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:55,290
go into a system online and release the

295
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,479
hold and the student is able to register

296
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:00,789
it's that important for us to have this

297
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,188
one-on-one contact with the student

298
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:09,849
every single semester so I advise and it

299
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:13,240
varies we added two new faculty a couple

300
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:16,089
years ago it's been as many as 30 but

301
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,839
now it hovers around probably 12 to 15

302
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:23,040
so it gets really busy during advising

303
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,679
season all right so we are a unionized

304
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,049
teaching institution and what that means

305
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:32,740
is we are actually contractually

306
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:36,549
obligated to teach twelve contact hours

307
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,500
each semester so this is actually this

308
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:40,139
is what I'm heading

309
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,799
back to white this is what I was so

310
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:48,720
great to be on sabbatical this is what I

311
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:52,079
missed so and so this is a lecture in

312
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,940
lab this is a lecture lecture this is a

313
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,950
lecture and a lab I just teach the

314
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,770
lecture portion and this is just more of

315
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,920
a almost like a a discussion section I

316
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:06,000
thought it'd be kind of interesting to

317
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:10,349
show everyone this is my schedule this

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,659
is what so we actually are obligated to

319
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,009
in fact this was really funny when I

320
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,889
came here I'm like where's everyone's

321
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:19,740
schedule on their door we have to put

322
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:22,529
this on our door this is so that

323
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,190
everybody knows not only where we are

324
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,569
but where we can be found because again

325
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,120
advising is such a critical piece of

326
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,250
this this hands-on this close

327
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,980
relationship we have with students the

328
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,889
other thing I wanted the other thing I

329
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,039
wanted to point out was that we schedule

330
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:43,710
in a way that helps us do this hands-on

331
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,319
learning so for example commercial

332
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,050
vegetable production has a lecture on

333
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,450
Monday but it also has a lecture and a

334
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:55,139
lab on Wednesday so I have a good 4

335
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,420
hours with the students in order to take

336
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:02,309
them on trips and do longer types of

337
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:05,039
projects IPM is there is no lab but the

338
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:07,259
lectures are scheduled back-to-back so

339
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,199
we in this case we have like about a 3

340
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:14,609
hour time frame that allows us to do a

341
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:17,220
little more oh and last thing is we are

342
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:20,578
also again contractually obligated to

343
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,439
have six office hours per week and so

344
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,688
these are these are times that we have

345
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,230
to be in our office and available to

346
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,680
students

347
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,660
alright so finally to the really fun and

348
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,880
interesting part what I actually get to

349
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,220
do when I teach horticulture it's oval

350
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,830
so this is the marketing of

351
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,559
horticultural products class this class

352
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:43,439
once again is really is required of

353
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,329
horticulture majors because a lot of our

354
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,940
students are going back to family

355
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:51,509
businesses or they're going to have

356
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:54,900
their own farms and so in this case we

357
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:58,799
take about four to five field trips each

358
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,530
semester the students are creating new

359
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,109
businesses and in this regard

360
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:07,470
it's a horticultural business they have

361
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:09,659
to actually have business cards they

362
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,390
create brochures they have an online

363
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,670
newsletter they write press releases in

364
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:18,270
some cases the students are actually

365
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,160
creating real businesses so it's pretty

366
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,809
exciting when they actually have

367
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,110
something that they're going to use

368
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:27,690
later on the end of the semester is what

369
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:30,509
we call shark tank and they're actually

370
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,029
doing presentations as if they were in

371
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:35,700
shark tank so that they can get

372
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:39,329
experience looking for business loans

373
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,610
some of our field trips are awesome it's

374
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:44,250
a little dark here but this is actually

375
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:47,399
the Philadelphia regional wholesale

376
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,589
produce market it is an amazing

377
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,780
state-of-the-art place it is the largest

378
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:54,480
refrigerated terminal market in the

379
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:57,690
world and if you have not been there I

380
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,210
would highly recommend a trip there it

381
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,890
does not break the cold chain so it's

382
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:07,289
very different than Hunts Point Market

383
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:09,330
we also visit farms in this case this is

384
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,750
an entertainment farm they have the

385
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:15,990
bouncing pillows and the pea so this is

386
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,240
like an open moon bounce and the farmers

387
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,779
are insistent that if the students try

388
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,839
that so they get a chance once again to

389
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:29,069
really get a feel for what it's like to

390
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:33,389
have an entertainment farm in organic

391
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:37,500
food and fiber which is a fall class we

392
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:40,440
take field trips again probably about

393
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,390
four every semester one of them is to

394
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,940
the Rodale Institute which as you'll see

395
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,830
is our partner in the organic farming

396
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,640
certificate program it's about an hour

397
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:54,928
from Del Val we visit various organic

398
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,320
farms this is a particular farm this is

399
00:19:54,929 --> 00:20:00,690
a an organic grocery store that's about

400
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,298
20 minutes from campus but one of the

401
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:06,629
neatest things that we do is the student

402
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:09,118
are actually involved in the organic

403
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:12,808
certification inspection that takes

404
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:15,298
place on one of our farms for many years

405
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:18,960
I was responsible for maintaining the

406
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:21,808
certification so what I will do is I'll

407
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,569
haul all my organic system plan and

408
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:28,200
documentation to class the students

409
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:32,009
actually get to see that and then this

410
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,960
is our inspector we go through the

411
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:37,710
inspection on the farm and then they

412
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,808
actually sit through the the exit

413
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,659
interview which is part of every organic

414
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:46,678
inspection this has been a really

415
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:49,109
wonderful exercise because of having so

416
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:54,359
many students who want to have organic

417
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:56,668
farms so often there is this curtain

418
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:59,970
behind what it means to be certified

419
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,919
organic and this exercise really opens

420
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:07,079
the curtain and shows everyone that it's

421
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:10,470
not a process that is is is terrible to

422
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:13,888
go through by any means the other thing

423
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,960
that we do again because organic food

424
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:20,038
and fiber has to deal with animals as

425
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,220
well we get in some guest lectures this

426
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:25,980
is a cow signals workshop and so we

427
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,368
actually are down in a dairy farm on

428
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,399
campus which you can just walk to and

429
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:34,678
the organic veterinarian is leading this

430
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:37,918
is actually a student he's leading the

431
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,129
students through an exercise looking at

432
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,019
cow signals which is a way to keep

433
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:47,699
cattle healthy when you are an organic

434
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:50,788
producer commercial vegetable production

435
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,788
which I've really enjoyed sitting in on

436
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:55,919
Steve's class we have a lab attached to

437
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:57,749
ours and one of the biggest things we do

438
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,559
is what's called the farmers apprentice

439
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:05,009
project in one of our greenhouses on

440
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:08,099
campus we have 12 raised beds each

441
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:10,108
raised bed is 40 square feet and so the

442
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,288
student and their partner raise

443
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:16,199
vegetables all semester and so it starts

444
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:17,460
out the beds start out empty or with

445
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,980
just you can see

446
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,620
the beginnings of the plantings we do

447
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,929
have lights in the greenhouse so this

448
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,689
helps in January and February when

449
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:30,240
there's really not enough outdoor light

450
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:32,759
but you can see that it becomes a jungle

451
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,940
in here and students really take

452
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:41,158
ownership of producing their crops they

453
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,960
love that they are able to harvest and

454
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,110
take everything home and eat what

455
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,850
they've actually produced not only bad

456
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:50,158
but they're doing scouting they're doing

457
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:52,019
pest control and one of the most

458
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,690
important things that they do in this

459
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:57,298
project is record keeping as anyone

460
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,149
knows today whether you're organic or

461
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:02,158
whether a conventional farmer because of

462
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:04,288
food safety concerns and traceability

463
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,460
every farmer needs to have good records

464
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:10,890
and so this is a this really trains them

465
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,288
in record-keeping absolutely everything

466
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,110
they're doing from what varieties

467
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:17,490
they've chosen to plant to what types of

468
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,189
pests or what types of pest control

469
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,829
measures they've done this is something

470
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,880
that students really enjoy and if you're

471
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:28,558
ever feeling gloomy on a March day you

472
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,409
just find people wandering in here

473
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:35,009
because it just becomes this wonderful

474
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:38,330
jungle of vegetable crops we do take

475
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:42,028
field trips in our commercial veg class

476
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:44,699
this is an alumni farm del val is

477
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:47,069
actually across the street from burpies

478
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,710
ford hook farm which is a really

479
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:54,389
beautiful place to go so we've gone to

480
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:56,490
Fort Hood farm this is jr. Peters it's a

481
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,880
fertilizer company about an hour from

482
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:03,690
Del Vale this is Kerry Peters and this

483
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,299
is Krystal Snyder crystals and alum and

484
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,179
so she hosts us at this amazing

485
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:12,210
fertilizer facility and so the students

486
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:15,000
actually get to see fertilizer being

487
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,890
blended and bagged and some of the

488
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,950
testing that they do with that facility

489
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:25,950
as well often times farms will they will

490
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:29,100
have exercises for the student or tasks

491
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,179
for the students to do so we've we've

492
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:34,888
done everything

493
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:37,940
from planting to digging the holes for

494
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:40,979
irrigation all kinds of different things

495
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,740
we're a little over an hour from hers

496
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,048
potato chip factory so we will sometimes

497
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,599
take field trips to hers where we meet

498
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:50,868
with gene her one of the owners and

499
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:54,178
operators who does all the potato buying

500
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:56,368
for the the chipping that goes on at

501
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,350
hers and the tour is just really fun

502
00:24:56,368 --> 00:25:00,569
because of course they pull the fresh

503
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:03,928
potato chips off the conveyor belt for

504
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:05,878
everyone to taste and then Lester

505
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:09,389
wondering why I have a chocolate world

506
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:11,668
photo here this is because one of the

507
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:14,849
field trips that's so important to us in

508
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:17,429
commercial vegetable production is the

509
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:19,918
going to the Mid Atlantic fruit and

510
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,499
vegetable growers convention in Hershey

511
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,019
Pennsylvania vegetable growers has been

512
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:28,019
gracious enough to let our students in

513
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:32,190
for free this has been going on for as

514
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:36,269
long as I as long as I've been there and

515
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:40,590
so we go on our class day it's a

516
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:43,169
Wednesday we take a bus and del Val used

517
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:46,439
to have their own buses but we now rent

518
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:48,720
through a service but we go to Hershey

519
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,340
for the day and students are able to get

520
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,200
in they're able to experience what a

521
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:56,220
grower meeting is all about they go to

522
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,869
talks and then every now and then if we

523
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:03,629
have extra time we stop at chocolate

524
00:25:57,868 --> 00:26:06,778
world so we do labs on campus similar to

525
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:10,439
what Steve has done we get students it's

526
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:13,048
we get students out on equipment we get

527
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,950
them planting laying plastic we're

528
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:19,589
planting potatoes sometimes we are able

529
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:22,619
to take advantage of what's happening on

530
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:24,740
our farms so in years past students have

531
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:27,689
actually helped build a high tunnel and

532
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,999
so it's I'm usually in pretty close

533
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,190
contact with our farm managers and if

534
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:34,139
something's going on and it fits into

535
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,899
our schedule in their schedule we try to

536
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:40,439
jump into this this is one of our high

537
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:42,928
tunnels that we actually plant and the

538
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,009
students are able to actually set up the

539
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,170
trickle irrigation

540
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:49,140
system so they get that kind of hands-on

541
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:52,200
way to do the plumbing and with the

542
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:57,420
headers and so on and so forth I also

543
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:00,000
teach a lab on grafting and so our the

544
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,250
students are taught three different ways

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,829
to graft Tomatoes

546
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,559
and so they do the grafting exercise and

547
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:09,679
then we monitor the progress on whether

548
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:14,509
the graft has been successful or not

549
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,509
throughout the remainder of the semester

550
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:20,910
IPM I wanted to include a class that

551
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,759
doesn't have a lab if you recall this is

552
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:27,600
scheduled so we have a long course

553
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:31,109
period we take a couple of field trips

554
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:34,079
that are really valuable you you may

555
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:36,089
remember Lloyd and Alex Traven from

556
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,369
Pease tree farms they are Cornell alums

557
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:41,819
they have a certified organic greenhouse

558
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:44,549
but they use all beneficial insects and

559
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:48,750
IPM practices in the greenhouse and this

560
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:50,490
is one of the most eye-opening field

561
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,650
trips for the students because they see

562
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,599
that you can have this immaculate

563
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:58,170
greenhouse full of many different

564
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:00,299
species of plants and have very very low

565
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:04,470
pest pressure through the use of

566
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:08,279
biological controls the the New Jersey

567
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:10,650
beneficial insect lab is an amazing

568
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,779
place in fact it's probably the next to

569
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:19,560
Steve is the best thing about New Jersey

570
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:21,599
yep this is part of New Jersey's

571
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,269
Department of Agriculture they actually

572
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,659
raise beneficial insects there it is

573
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:29,460
very unique there are not labs like this

574
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:33,210
around the country this is only one of a

575
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,730
handful and we take students there and

576
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,559
they're very welcoming they show us the

577
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,360
lab they show us how they raise their

578
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,399
beneficial insects and some of the

579
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,769
projects that they are they've been

580
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,259
involved in students also do what's

581
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:48,299
called an IPM toolbox it's a very

582
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,670
lengthy project broken up into pieces

583
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,639
but again they're able to choose a crop

584
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,820
and they come out with a set of

585
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,620
information that they take with them

586
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,559
when they're working in a greenhouse

587
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:04,559
when they're working on a farm and so

588
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,690
the the IPM toolbox as big of a project

589
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,419
as it is I always get very positive

590
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,430
comments that students have enjoyed

591
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,310
doing this and taking this deep dive

592
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:18,570
into what IPM really means for their

593
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:20,879
specific crop um I would be remiss if I

594
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:23,279
didn't actually talk about assessment

595
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,140
and student engagement I've spent a lot

596
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,789
of time here at Cornell looking over

597
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,880
your Center for teaching innovation

598
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:31,200
website and I think that we are I think

599
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,790
we're doing what we're supposed to be

600
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,900
doing in Daleville which was really a

601
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:39,930
nice thing to see and so we have a lot

602
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:43,259
of time for discussion one of the things

603
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:46,110
that I do is that there's actually

604
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:48,720
questions about the field trip on the

605
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:51,359
exams so these field trips don't just

606
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,309
exist because they're enjoyable to get

607
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,959
off campus they're tested on what they

608
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:57,990
learn students are encouraged to take

609
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,299
notes to take pictures and to integrate

610
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:04,230
what they've learned on the farm into

611
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:08,940
any project that they're doing the e360

612
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:11,490
program again students are employed

613
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,009
they're working they're encouraged to

614
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,500
provide feedback on whether learning has

615
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:19,319
taken place so again I believe that

616
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:23,809
we're doing what we should be doing as

617
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:27,569
far as all of the teaching and learning

618
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:29,789
research that's been done lastly I just

619
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:33,089
have a few more slides on one of our

620
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:35,159
most hands-on programs not a class but a

621
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:37,470
program is our organic farming

622
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,230
certificate program we are partnered

623
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:45,240
with the Rodale Institute and we've

624
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:47,370
actually been supported by to USDA

625
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,750
beginning farmer and rancher development

626
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:53,759
grants really exciting at this point in

627
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,089
my career I'm finally getting grants

628
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:59,099
which is so but it has been a whole

629
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:01,889
learning experience for me

630
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:04,409
we have about 75% veterans in this

631
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,810
program but they're integrated right

632
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,740
into our regular classes which has been

633
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:10,168
a real challenge

634
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,609
from a teaching and learning perspective

635
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:14,230
they're spending the summer session

636
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:18,298
though at Rodale where they have two

637
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:22,269
other academic classes and then the the

638
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:24,940
farm practicum is essentially our

639
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:27,099
version of this e3 60 they're actually

640
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,320
working on a farm and then we have a

641
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:31,538
class period where everyone reflects on

642
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:34,028
the work they're doing and shares what

643
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:39,009
they're doing and everybody kind of gets

644
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:42,038
to to learn from that this is an awesome

645
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:44,409
hands-on thing that I'm able to do this

646
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:46,419
is global field studies and so I do

647
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:49,210
teach a course every other year in

648
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:51,309
gardens food food and farms in Tuscany

649
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,629
you really can't learn about Italian

650
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:59,829
food without going to Italy and and so

651
00:31:55,628 --> 00:32:02,498
so we take or I should say I take

652
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:04,868
students and we go to this amazing farm

653
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:07,659
called spin akhiya and I would truly if

654
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:10,599
anyone here wants to take students I

655
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:13,629
would highly recommend this place it's

656
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:17,439
awesome they are set up with places like

657
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:20,138
almost like dorms for students to live

658
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,860
in they produce all the food that they

659
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:26,229
serve they have classes right there so

660
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:28,928
this is something that again hands-on

661
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:32,139
learning not only about horticulture but

662
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:35,379
about the culture of Italy and the there

663
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:38,498
the way they approach food so that's a

664
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:41,349
lot of fun as well and then lastly our

665
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:44,980
clubs and our organizations also reflect

666
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:47,740
the hands-on philosophy of Deauville I'm

667
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,649
the advisor of ort Society which is our

668
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,679
horticulture Club and so we take field

669
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:56,199
trips to of course see mushrooms which

670
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,350
Philadelphia is the mushroom capital of

671
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,379
the US and we're not far from a

672
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:05,079
cranberry farm and which I was saying to

673
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:07,740
someone this morning the if and I'm

674
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:11,048
inviting you all to come out next fall

675
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,990
the farmer actually has a whole set of

676
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:16,349
hip waders and so everybody puts on hip

677
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:19,419
waders and goes into the cranberry bog

678
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:22,449
which is awesome and then we also take

679
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:24,910
groups of students to another conference

680
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,490
Sylvania Association for sustainable

681
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,279
agriculture which has been historically

682
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:33,099
held at Penn State but now it's gonna be

683
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,069
in Lancaster so it's even closer all

684
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:38,169
right so my time is just about up and I

685
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:40,569
just want to once again thank everyone

686
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:44,670
here at Cornell for being so welcoming

687
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:47,710
I've had such a wonderful sabbatical I

688
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:50,519
came across this poem from Liberty High

689
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,750
Bailey and I felt like it's really

690
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:56,319
important for me to finish with this I'm

691
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:58,990
gonna read this because it it's about

692
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,960
the way that Liberty High Bailey thought

693
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:05,289
we should be teaching and the way I

694
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,139
believed in teaching so there certainly

695
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:10,659
will come a day as men become simple and

696
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,589
wise when schools will put their books

697
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:16,539
away till they train the hands and eyes

698
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:19,450
then the school from its heart will say

699
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:24,579
in love of the wind and the skies I

700
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:28,839
teach the earth and the soil to them

701
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:34,389
that toil the hill and fun to common men

702
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:36,760
that live just here so thank you

703
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:50,379
everybody I'd be happy to answer any

704
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:52,120
questions so the question was when do I

705
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,550
schedule the longer field trips so the

706
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,219
Italy trip because it's horticultural in

707
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:00,250
nature I go in September and I always

708
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:03,849
schedule it over the Labor Day it's ten

709
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:06,340
days so we I schedule it over the Labor

710
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:09,909
Day weekend and so the students are

711
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,829
missing like a little bit less and also

712
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:14,349
because it's so early in the semester we

713
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,929
actually start about a week later than

714
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:18,940
Cornell starts we're usually in about

715
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:21,789
the second week of the semester so

716
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:25,059
students aren't really big they're

717
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:26,529
missing classes but it's it's they can

718
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:28,739
catch up they have a lot of time to

719
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,740
catch up

720
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:36,900
No

721
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,610
um we are that's a no that's a great

722
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,289
question to other faculty get upset

723
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,940
because students are missing classes I

724
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:47,250
would honestly tell you that we are so

725
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,490
everyone does lots of trips and field

726
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,440
trips you get used to it it's something

727
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:54,419
that is part of the Daleville culture

728
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,630
that everyone just is accepting if

729
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,240
somebody we have a very active FFA group

730
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,519
and they usually go for a whole week you

731
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,250
just you just help the student catch up

732
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,889
and provide as much support material as

733
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:11,489
you can through blackboard and

734
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:13,559
everything else so that the student you

735
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:22,129
know as I said is missing as little as

736
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:22,130
possible so UT of classes I'm wondering

737
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:39,539
thank you so much I asked when I took a

738
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:44,030
risk I think that the I think that the

739
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:47,099
the biggest risk I felt was teaching IPM

740
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:49,320
just because I had a very coming out of

741
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,110
graduate school I had a very strong

742
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,420
background in weed science but not so

743
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,460
much in entomology and plant pathology I

744
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,690
mean the background that everyone

745
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:03,659
typically has but um I feel like IPM is

746
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:08,159
the class that I've I've developed the

747
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:11,159
most and am very very successful at

748
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:14,250
teaching and so yes I think it I took

749
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:18,000
some risks with that but also then I was

750
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:21,570
um very early on I also started

751
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,570
promoting the whole idea of beneficial

752
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:26,970
insects and using bio controls and I

753
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:31,019
think everyone now can say wow this is

754
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:33,480
there's so much going on in that area so

755
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:36,360
that's where I would say yes taking

756
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:41,190
taking a risk of teaching is that's

757
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:43,440
where that was Don Jackie first thank

758
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:46,860
you so much for your seminar and for

759
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,568
sharing LH Bailey's home that home was

760
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,439
very reflective

761
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:54,599
is engagement with the nature studies

762
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:58,678
which also featured people I get a box

763
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:01,859
for Comstock and Louie Ghazis my

764
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,289
question is can you talk a bit about the

765
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:06,389
demographics of your students where they

766
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:09,150
come from what their backgrounds are

767
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:10,650
like yes thank you Don the demographics

768
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,769
of our students and that's a good that's

769
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:16,108
an excellent question the majority of

770
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:18,238
our students are from Pennsylvania and

771
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:21,900
New Jersey and then the mid-atlantic

772
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:24,749
region many of our students are still

773
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,660
first-generation college students and

774
00:38:24,748 --> 00:38:32,248
they and they are by and large from

775
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:35,489
rural backgrounds so their high school

776
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:37,649
preparation for college is certainly not

777
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:41,608
as strong as you would find in a Cornell

778
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:45,869
student also our average SATs although

779
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:49,528
in horticulture is fairly high in

780
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:52,919
general for for Daleville as a whole is

781
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:56,009
significantly lower than the typical the

782
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:57,989
typical Cornell student so so while not

783
00:38:56,009 --> 00:39:00,838
everyone is from a farm they're

784
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:03,749
generally from a rural community in the

785
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:07,679
mid-atlantic region and so they want to

786
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:11,368
go back to that community and and and

787
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:14,989
have some sort of career in in

788
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:18,449
agriculture also I should make note we

789
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:23,759
we do not send very many students to

790
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:27,028
graduate school I would say 5% of our

791
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:30,659
graduates go on to graduate school maybe

792
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:33,150
10% but but really very very few so

793
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:35,729
these are people who are going into the

794
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,889
agricultural industry working in

795
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:40,828
greenhouses we do a really good job

796
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:43,348
placing students at Longwood Gardens and

797
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:45,689
Delvaux students are known I think

798
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:47,939
historically for being able to hit the

799
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:49,739
ground running when they start their

800
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:52,858
employment because they've had such a

801
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:57,858
such a hands-on type of training on so

802
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:57,858
much job experience Hannah

803
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:09,460
so almost all of our um almost arbor

804
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:12,009
Hannah's question was what our summers

805
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:16,030
like at Dell Val for four faculty

806
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:17,580
they're awesome I would be lying if I

807
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:20,950
didn't say that

808
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:23,769
but for students some students will stay

809
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:25,239
and work on the farm at Dell Vail this

810
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:29,259
past summer we actually had something

811
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:31,868
new since we're so close to burpees Fort

812
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,130
Hood farm we actually they wanted to

813
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:35,349
give their round a rest

814
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,690
so all of their trial gardens moved over

815
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:39,640
to del val so we had a number of interns

816
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,010
working on the trial gardens this summer

817
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:44,650
there's also just a group who works with

818
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,900
production we have what's called a hope

819
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:50,530
for the harvest garden a charitable

820
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:54,400
garden where we just produce four to

821
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:57,040
give away to fill abundance it's a local

822
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,269
food charity but most students will go

823
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:02,858
back to where they're from and and find

824
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:05,500
some sort of because they're generally

825
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:07,989
from an agricultural region they'll find

826
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:21,338
some sort of job that will count towards

827
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:22,569
their e3 60 credits yes so the question

828
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:25,349
is do students go through the

829
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:28,690
tree-climbing certification program I

830
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:31,180
don't know exactly if they do but we

831
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,519
tend to have a lot of in that because I

832
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:36,449
don't teach that class but we tend to

833
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:39,070
have a lot of add-ons in our class so

834
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:41,409
there's a course where that you can take

835
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:45,700
that you get your pesticide applicators

836
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:48,579
license and then in the past and I

837
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:51,129
haven't done this recently because but

838
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:53,079
in the past some of my classes have

839
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,880
actually counted towards the credits

840
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:58,000
that you need to keep renewing your

841
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,670
pesticide applicators license so we do

842
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:08,760
try to have add-ons like that as much as

843
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:11,769
possible all right so I can't wait you

844
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,810
know and I actually that's a again a

845
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:15,610
great are there things I've seen here

846
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:20,199
yes there absolutely are and

847
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,519
bencao very helpful in the plant anatomy

848
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:25,149
class

849
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:28,179
alejandro nixon flips the classroom and

850
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,160
i'm going to i'm gonna do that we're

851
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,960
going to integrate that into the botany

852
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,559
lab which I've been working on revising

853
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:38,369
a botany lab manual Steve and his

854
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,049
vegetable production does the

855
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:44,829
problem-solving which has I think is

856
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:47,080
excellent because it really it it gives

857
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:50,110
the students an opportunity to actually

858
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,179
talk to the class about you know

859
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:55,630
questions and what type of what they're

860
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:57,219
seeing in the field so yes that and then

861
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,650
Marvin I love the idea of the

862
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:01,809
e-portfolio and I'd love to bring

863
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:05,230
something like that back to del Val

864
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:23,079
so we'll see all right Annie oh yes one

865
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:25,510
more I'm back yes so the question is how

866
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:29,559
like how much leeway do you have for

867
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:31,120
developing new and innovative you can we

868
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,670
have a lot of leeway if there's

869
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,589
something that you want to teach then

870
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,900
you are encouraged to develop a new

871
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:41,079
course around that so for example we

872
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,180
have someone who just was hired about

873
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,009
two years ago from University of

874
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:47,859
California Davis is a she's a plant

875
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:51,250
breeder and she's developed a new crop

876
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:54,010
evolution class we have someone else who

877
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:56,769
is interested in medicinal plants they

878
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:00,880
just developed that new class someone

879
00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:03,309
else her global field studies classes

880
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,369
she took students to Hawaii last spring

881
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:09,400
break so she developed not only the

882
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:12,219
Hawaii trip but a lecture class around

883
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,349
that so that's that's because we're not

884
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:17,769
doing research we're really encouraged

885
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:19,599
to do that type of scholarship for our

886
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:22,090
promotion and tenure packages our

887
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,880
portfolios it's the scholarship of

888
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,730
teaching that is really what has to come

889
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,960
through loud and clear so developing new

890
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,750
classes is

891
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,960
part of that and then there's also a set

892
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,989
of one credit honors colloquia that are

893
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,480
usually available to teach if you want

894
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:44,049
to try something out just one lecture a

895
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:54,429
week you can do but take that path as

896
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:56,500
well all right thank you everyone this

897
00:44:54,429 --> 00:45:02,279
has been a production of Cornell

898
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,280
University on the web at cornell edu
