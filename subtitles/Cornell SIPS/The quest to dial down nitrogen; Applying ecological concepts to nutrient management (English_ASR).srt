1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,269
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,269
University

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:14,240
so I'm gonna talk about the quest to

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,410
dial down nitrogen today and I bet some

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,109
of you were wondering where I got that

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,390
title from somebody told me that they

7
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:25,129
were surprised to see the title from

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,630
someone serious like me so I'm not gonna

9
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:30,500
tell you who said that I'm gonna share

10
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:32,479
with you some information you can find

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,609
anything on the Internet there is an

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:40,179
advertising slogan generator there's the

13
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:40,179
URL now I had choices and it was hard

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,500
but I ultimately settled on this one

15
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,420
because I could relate it to my research

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,920
I liked this one but I couldn't think of

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,600
how to relate it to my research so if

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,460
any of you people to think of how to

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,000
relate this to what I'm talking about

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,539
today let me know afterwards okay all

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,670
right so today I'm going to talk about

22
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,198
some of the recent projects that we've

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,058
been working on in my lab and I want to

24
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,280
thank you all for coming and I really

25
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:10,009
appreciate this opportunity to share

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,170
this with you I'm going to first start

27
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,420
by talking about the context of the work

28
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,210
we do in the lab I am going to spend

29
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,710
about a third of the talk on that

30
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:22,039
because there are some new discoveries

31
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,899
that are really useful to apply to the

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,790
problems that we work on so I want to

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,430
spend time talking about that before I

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,979
go into three different projects which

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:33,740
I'll touch on briefly beginning with

36
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:35,450
some mass balance work and then I'll

37
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:37,069
talk about some of our work in nitrogen

38
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,618
fixation we've been doing quite a lot of

39
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,059
work on nitrogen fixation in many

40
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:44,478
different settings for the past few

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,719
years and then I'll tackle the monster

42
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,340
project that is the collaboration with

43
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,179
social scientists and biophysical

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,000
scientists about linkages across the

45
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,820
ecological social ecological interface

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,728
okay so the one thing that's notable

47
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:04,188
about the problem of nitrogen loss from

48
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:07,459
agriculture is its persistence and also

49
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:10,310
the global extent of the consequences of

50
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,780
this problem so about half the nitrogen

51
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,879
fertilizer is lost from agricultural

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,500
and this really varies depending on the

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,840
type of system that you're talking about

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,210
but it accounts for about three-quarters

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,210
of the anthropogenic nitrogen that's

56
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,349
been added to the global nitrogen cycle

57
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,599
and there's a number of environmental

58
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,459
consequences ranging from increased

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,900
greenhouse gas emissions and climate

60
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:36,150
change to changes in ecosystem species

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,370
composition function due to things like

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,159
nitrogen deposition and then also

63
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,400
eautiful or pollution of fresh water and

64
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,250
also nearshore marine environments so

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,780
that now we've got about 400 hypoxic

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,300
zones and actually the number is

67
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,069
increasing so before I go into some of

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,230
the work we're doing I want to just

69
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,789
review the nitrogen cycle really briefly

70
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:04,500
for those of you that don't live

71
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:07,919
immersed in nitrogen like we do so in an

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,270
unmanaged ecosystem the internal cycling

73
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:14,280
dominates most new n is coming in as

74
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,290
from nitrogen fixation and then there

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,629
are multiple loss it's feels weird to

76
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:21,539
use a laser being this close but I need

77
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,939
a stick there's a multiple lot I like

78
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,250
this better there's some multiple loss

79
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,099
pathways these are usually small but

80
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,019
they can vary and actually understanding

81
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,479
variation in these losses across

82
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,200
ecosystems has been a focus of a lot of

83
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:39,780
of forests and other ecologists working

84
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,488
on ecosystems ok we have a different

85
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,009
situation in agriculture we've got this

86
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,590
huge off take through harvest so to

87
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,870
compensate we add nitrogen fertilizer

88
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,569
which increases our inorganic nitrogen

89
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,969
pools especially nitrate which then

90
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,549
pushes these loss pathways particularly

91
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,709
denitrification and leaching in north

92
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,219
american to some extent ammonia

93
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,140
volatilization so how do we deal with

94
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,409
this problem

95
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:09,988
well what's notable about the approach

96
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,599
that we've used is that we're focusing

97
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,700
mainly on this single pathway here so

98
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,608
nitrogen fertilizer goes into the soil

99
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,719
in this plant available form and the

100
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,819
strategy is

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,770
to increase the efficiency or delivery

102
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,110
to the crop and there are many there's a

103
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,269
plethora of technologies that are all

104
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,939
geared towards increasing this

105
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:35,310
efficiency the sort of guiding sort of

106
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:36,870
the guiding strategy is the four R's you

107
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,430
can find this all over the internet with

108
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,620
you know how to improve your nitrogen

109
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,800
management focused on using the right

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,079
product at the right rate and time and

111
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,319
place so delivering it to the crop roots

112
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,509
when it's needed and this strategy has

113
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,139
been somewhat effective there are some

114
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:57,990
cases where the efficiency of fertilizer

115
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,029
use has been more than double by side

116
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,920
dressing for example five times during

117
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:04,019
the growing season is one thing that's

118
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,140
been effective so the approach that

119
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:08,939
we've used in my lab to address the

120
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,039
problem of nitrogen is is sort of

121
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,500
complimentary to this where we focused

122
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,280
on a number of processes at the same

123
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,610
time and there's two areas of ecological

124
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:23,339
research that are the basis for most of

125
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,169
our work the first comes from ecosystem

126
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:28,619
ecology and this is called the nitrogen

127
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:31,680
saturation Theory nitrogen saturation is

128
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,470
defined as when the nitrogen in flux in

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,290
exceeds the capacity of the ecosystem to

130
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,760
assimilate nitrogen through either plant

131
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,800
or microbial uptake or to store nitrogen

132
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,478
basically in soil organic matter

133
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
reservoirs for the most part in ways

134
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,579
that could be accessed by plants or

135
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,119
microbes later on so once you get beyond

136
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:56,728
this point then you are at saturation

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,060
and I'll talk about the symptoms in a

138
00:05:56,728 --> 00:06:02,129
minute but this framework is able to

139
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,339
predict the ecosystem response in

140
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:07,469
pollution or atmospheric deposition and

141
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,049
actually that was one of the main

142
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,800
reasons why this framework was developed

143
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,449
by a group of ecologist working in

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,939
forested ecosystems in the northeastern

145
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,128
US so they were trying to explain

146
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,348
differences in nitrogen loss of

147
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,689
tension that they saw in these natural

148
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,800
ecosystems which were all in theory

149
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,050
undisturbed

150
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,059
they had very high biodiversity no

151
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,489
tillage you know why were they losing so

152
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:35,669
much nitrogen and this has had a huge

153
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:38,128
impact on ecology and I think also it

154
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:40,948
has potential to really inform

155
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:44,819
agriculture provides a framework for

156
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,459
understanding how nitrogen cycling is

157
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,080
connected to other elemental cycles in

158
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:55,429
particular this connection between

159
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:58,558
nitrogen and carbon is highlighted so

160
00:06:55,428 --> 00:07:00,598
there we go so here's the symptoms of

161
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,300
nitrogen saturation can see beginning

162
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:06,928
from increased rates of nitrification

163
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,240
through to the losses and also the form

164
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:11,908
of nitrogen that's lost and increased

165
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,610
nitrous oxide fluxes from

166
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:16,050
denitrification these all are basically

167
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,239
what we see in agricultural systems

168
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,919
because we're managing them as a

169
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,718
nitrogen saturated system and this is

170
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,998
one of the challenges in trying to

171
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:27,928
reduce nitrogen losses by solely

172
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:29,579
focusing on nitrogen alone and so losses

173
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:31,649
are a symptom of nitrogen saturation

174
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,918
whether you're talking about forests in

175
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:37,079
this case these are 3/4 in you know in

176
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:40,288
North America compared to temperate

177
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,588
forests so a similar kind of environment

178
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:45,718
these are forests in South America

179
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:47,338
nitrogen deposition from human

180
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:49,168
activities it's very high in North

181
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:51,449
America and so we see very high losses

182
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:54,058
that consist mostly of nitrate in these

183
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,610
forests we see a similar thing in

184
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:59,659
agricultural systems with this

185
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,369
relationship between the nitrogen input

186
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:05,779
explaining about half the variation in

187
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:10,130
unrecovered nitrogen

188
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:13,159
so a second area of ecological knowledge

189
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:15,139
or research that is the basis for some

190
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,900
of our work is this is comes from

191
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,879
rhizosphere ecology and brian talked a

192
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,939
little bit about this a couple of weeks

193
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,519
ago at the grad review and the

194
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,680
recognition for the role of plant

195
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,979
microbial collaborations and driving

196
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,379
decomposition so one implication of this

197
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:37,038
is the realization that this very small

198
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:39,860
limited habitat the rhizosphere which is

199
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,069
my new compared to bulk soil in some

200
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,050
ecosystems actually dominates nutrient

201
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,290
cycling in some ecosystems because

202
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:50,839
there's so much activity another aspect

203
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:52,849
of this that's been it's had a big

204
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,160
impact it's just recognizing that here's

205
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,090
another adaptive strategy that plants

206
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,740
can use to for nutrient acquisition and

207
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,840
this that could be something that we

208
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,310
could intentionally manage in

209
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,500
agriculture so this is shaking this view

210
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:12,409
of decomposition as solely and

211
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,480
microbially regulated process sure you

212
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:16,939
can still put soil in a jar and you'll

213
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,600
still get decomposition and that is

214
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,860
useful for asking certain questions but

215
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,779
we have to realize that that's not

216
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,240
reflective at all of the decomposition

217
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:29,649
that could be occurring out in the field

218
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,899
or in a you know an intact ecosystem

219
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,329
instead of this collaboration between

220
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,639
plants and microbes where the plants are

221
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,839
providing labile carbon to the primary

222
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:43,129
decomposer so bacteria and Bunji

223
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,830
allowing them to break down the more

224
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,799
recalcitrant organic matter pools take

225
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,839
up nutrients the release of the

226
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,729
nutrients actually requires other

227
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:56,180
participants from the food web

228
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,639
so when grazers like protozoans feed on

229
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,379
these primary decomposers there's a net

230
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,088
loss of carbon and a release of

231
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:05,419
inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus that

232
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:07,880
can be taken up by plants and the

233
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,610
Predators also can play a role we've got

234
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,500
that

235
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,720
of complexity in here and your food web

236
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,179
and this all happens in the rhizosphere

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,759
very it's very tightly coupled this

238
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,659
process can increase decomposition

239
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,429
compared to bulk soil by two to tenfold

240
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:26,429
so that's some of the the numbers that

241
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:29,489
are out there and we think that this

242
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:31,559
mechanism actually that can explain this

243
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,470
observation that here's three of our

244
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,528
very important crops corn and small

245
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,720
grains and the majority of the nitrogen

246
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:41,850
that these crops take up comes from the

247
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,879
soil so less than 40 percent despite

248
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,709
having plenty of fertilizer less than 40

249
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:52,009
percent of the nitrogen in these crops

250
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:55,559
in 217 studies came from the fertilizer

251
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,360
so that's that's sort of the you know

252
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,979
shows us the challenge that we're up

253
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,100
against so if we take this information

254
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,339
together we can see that this problem of

255
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,459
leakiness in agriculture is is really

256
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,410
systemic and it begins with this use of

257
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,659
inorganic nitrogen which is the most

258
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:14,610
difficult form of nitrogen to actually

259
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:18,240
control in the environment and to keep

260
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,159
in ecosystem and it's exacerbated by the

261
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,169
fact that plants are going to take up

262
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,958
nitrogen from soil organic matter

263
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:26,939
because they've evolved along with

264
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,578
microorganisms to be able to access

265
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,260
those pools and then when this is

266
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,719
coupled with some of the structural

267
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:37,139
changes in rotations that have increased

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,769
fallows and have reduced inputs of

269
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:43,769
carbon into the soil or accelerated

270
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:46,528
decomposition through tillage we end up

271
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:49,470
with a soil that's got even less organic

272
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,789
matter so that we've got microbes that

273
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,199
are in the soil and they basically are

274
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:55,708
starved for carbon they're not

275
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:58,439
interested in nitrogen so the potential

276
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,969
to absorb nitrogen is is reduced in

277
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,850
these systems so there's kind of

278
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,759
multiple levels where we have this

279
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,490
problem of limited carbon and we end up

280
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:14,039
with loss pathways such as the United

281
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:17,399
to nitrate leaching predominating so we

282
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,349
use a typology to describe the different

283
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,289
strategies for approaching this problem

284
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,820
of nitrogen leakiness and from an

285
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:26,699
ecological perspective we can identify

286
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,278
three distinct strategies so one is end

287
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,950
of pipe where and we don't really work

288
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,870
on that very much so we just say well we

289
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,759
know that we're gonna lose nitrogen so

290
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,769
let's intercept it before it gets to the

291
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,240
places where we don't want it to be so

292
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,100
this is something that is getting a lot

293
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,528
of tension attention particularly in the

294
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,870
Mississippi River Basin where about 30

295
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:48,419
years of work at the field scale it's

296
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,789
still not resulted in significant

297
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:54,299
reductions in nitrate in the waterways

298
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:56,759
surrounding these lands okay a second is

299
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,109
fertilizer based or the single process

300
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,569
so I already talked about that one

301
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,450
that's the dominant approach and then a

302
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,550
third we call ecological or sea in

303
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,370
couple so these approaches manage

304
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:10,799
multiple processes and then are focused

305
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,470
on agro ecosystem scale nitrogen

306
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,049
retention as part of the process with

307
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,970
the strategy of reducing the nitrogen

308
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:20,819
surplus since we know the surplus from

309
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,660
nitrogen saturation theory we know that

310
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,490
the surplus is a big driver of losses so

311
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:29,278
one way to reduce losses is to be able

312
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,279
to somehow reduce the surplus nitrogen

313
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,919
that you're adding to the system

314
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,699
so I'm gonna start by talking about some

315
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:41,639
of our work with field sale nitrogen

316
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,350
mass balances and our question here is

317
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,169
basically how does management impact

318
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,080
field scale nutrient flows and of course

319
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:52,649
our hypothesis was that these methods

320
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,660
that involve increasing carbon nitrogen

321
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,139
coupling or that are targeting or

322
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:00,149
impacting multiple processes that affect

323
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,850
nitrogen retention are going to show

324
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:06,449
reduced surpluses and reduce nitrogen

325
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,970
losses and I'm going to talk about two

326
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:13,050
pieces of work from my former graduate

327
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,750
student Jennifer blush we first did a

328
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,879
meta-analysis of the m15 literature or

329
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,190
to ask this question what are we finding

330
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,759
in the experimental plots in terms of

331
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,530
nitrogen recovery and then we went to

332
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,450
the Mississippi River Basin to those

333
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,549
grain systems because a great deal of

334
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,009
this research that's been done on

335
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:33,990
nitrogen using in 15 has been done with

336
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:38,580
grain systems particularly in temperate

337
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:42,269
systems so these are some of the results

338
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,710
from the meta-analysis so for those of

339
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,659
you not used to looking at these so if

340
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,339
there's no effect of a management

341
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,600
practice and the management practices

342
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,700
are listed here so I'll take

343
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,800
nitrification inhibitor as an example

344
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,460
there's no effect then we'd see the

345
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:59,659
average change here at zero instead we

346
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,120
have it at nearly 7% so this means that

347
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:06,559
compared to the standard practice which

348
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,620
is broadcast fertilizer in most cases

349
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,689
using a nitrification inhibitor increase

350
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,080
the nitrogen fertilizer recovery by

351
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,030
nearly 7 percent ok so we can see we

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,089
kind of grant we've got them arranged in

353
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:24,209
order of the two practices that focus on

354
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,980
fertilizer proximity to the roots and

355
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,230
the timing particularly you know fall

356
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,600
versus spring had the greatest impact so

357
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:36,300
increasing the recovery by 24 and 18%

358
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,460
but compared to these we had to sort of

359
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:42,059
ecologically

360
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,910
based or cm coupling based practices

361
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,009
prop rotation so this is a more complex

362
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,949
crop rotation that reduces bear fallows

363
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:52,139
and then the source of nitrogen could be

364
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,720
manure compost or leggings most were

365
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,269
legumes and manure and both of these

366
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,330
practices increased recovery by about

367
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,740
thirty five percent so we wondered well

368
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,470
what will we see if we go out to

369
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,730
farmer's fields will we see this kind of

370
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:11,370
a range in the recovery or loss

371
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,070
reduction well you can't manage you

372
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:17,070
can't measure losses out in working

373
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,470
fields very well unless you've got you

374
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:23,250
know a sort of a multi-billion dollar

375
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,839
budget to put all the instruments out in

376
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,789
the field and a bunch of farmers who you

377
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,490
can then pay for all the inconvenience

378
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:32,309
of doing that so instead of trying to

379
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,889
measure losses we constructed budgets

380
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:37,439
for these fields simple nutrient and

381
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:40,080
nitrogen mass balanced budgets so first

382
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,000
of all we look for we found four regions

383
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,100
in the Mississippi River Basin where we

384
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,649
could actually find a diverse range of

385
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,409
farms and this is not easy to find in

386
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,509
that in that part of the country so we

387
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:54,449
were able to find systems that range

388
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:56,669
from the dominant corn soybean rotations

389
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,740
to those that some that incorporated

390
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:01,319
winter grains or had some diversity in

391
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,019
their rotations to others that include

392
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,328
perennials forages legumes and then some

393
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,889
we also found organic production systems

394
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:10,109
that don't use any fertilizer nitrogen

395
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,829
at all so that was our continuum in

396
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:17,759
these four regions we identified 110

397
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:20,129
feel farms and use two fields in in each

398
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,170
of those to construct a budget and it's

399
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,199
a simple input-output budget so the

400
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,970
inputs were fertilizer biological

401
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,019
nitrogen fixation and nitrogen from

402
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,170
manure and then the output output that

403
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:37,740
we measured was the nitrogen harvested

404
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:40,050
and we constructed the budget just as

405
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,289
exports subtracted from inputs to get

406
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,299
the balance and we know that surplus

407
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,450
will drive losses so the greater the

408
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,279
surplus all other things being equal

409
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,000
the more vulnerable the system is for

410
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:57,529
nitrogen loss if we find deficits then

411
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,039
there's a danger of mining soil and we

412
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,899
found that these mass balances agreed

413
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,409
very well with what we found in the

414
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,180
meta-analysis from the research plots so

415
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,850
the liking base if we look at the

416
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,759
nitrogen sources the legging base had

417
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:17,509
the smallest surplus meaning that they

418
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,849
have the least their least vulnerable to

419
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:21,559
nitrogen losses there was a an

420
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,439
interesting difference between spring

421
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,329
applied versus fall applied manure so

422
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,799
systems that put manure at different

423
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:30,049
times that they put on the fall they

424
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,480
tend to really be over applying nitrogen

425
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:34,909
and then the fertilizer based methods

426
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,460
sort of fell out in the middle here with

427
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:41,269
surpluses that range for about 35 to 38

428
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,610
kilograms per hectare per year and if we

429
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:46,250
look at rotations so this is just summer

430
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:49,159
annuals just corn soybeans this is we

431
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,950
had only 29 fields that actually

432
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,230
incorporated a winter annual only and

433
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,569
then we had almost 70 that had

434
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,519
perennials and usually perennials often

435
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,599
means that they also have leggings so we

436
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,180
cannot tease apart the effect of

437
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:07,219
rotation or perennials from the use of

438
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,350
biological nitrogen fixation that's one

439
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,170
of the the challenges of doing on-farm

440
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,959
studies but we say that you know we feel

441
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,980
good because this agrees with the

442
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,870
meta-analysis and also with the

443
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,099
predictions of nitrogen saturation

444
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:25,500
theory

445
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:27,629
oh gosh I'm sorry I was pointing out the

446
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,429
these are the surplus so this is the

447
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,929
input this is I'm yeah this is the

448
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:37,048
addition this is the export and that's

449
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:39,530
the surplus yeah that's right there's no

450
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:43,619
key there this is the danger of yeah

451
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:46,619
okay clear now yeah sorry

452
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:49,469
okay the other interesting relationship

453
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:52,168
that we see in this dataset is that as

454
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,538
you increase the proportion of nitrogen

455
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:57,419
that's derived from biological nitrogen

456
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,950
fixation you also reduce the surplus and

457
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,900
we do have some here that are showing a

458
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,509
small deficit we only saw this

459
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,519
relationship if the nitrogen rate the

460
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,599
annual additions were over where eighty

461
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,129
one kilograms per hectare or over but it

462
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,168
was pretty consistent we've also seen

463
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,150
this in some of the regional farms and

464
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,650
I'll I'll show you some of that so this

465
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,570
is an intriguing result because it

466
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,059
suggests that you know there is some

467
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:23,759
inherent efficiency a rule of increasing

468
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:30,658
the proportion of nitrogen fixation that

469
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:33,000
you're using in your system so we think

470
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,190
that these results show that there's

471
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,589
there's multiple benefits it's a win-win

472
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,970
situation not only do we reduce nitrogen

473
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:40,949
losses which is what you get if you

474
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,339
improve fertilizer use efficiency which

475
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,259
is a very important outcome but we also

476
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:48,480
will see reduction in greenhouse gas

477
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,220
emissions because nitrogen fixation is a

478
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,529
solar-powered technology and I think

479
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,769
it's one of the underused solar-powered

480
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:58,829
technologies that are out there so we've

481
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:00,629
got a great one in agriculture so we

482
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:03,538
also end up building organic matter

483
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,640
reserves which will enable plants to

484
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,980
rely on this mechanism that they've

485
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,530
developed over through evolution over

486
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,059
love breaking down organic matter and I

487
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:15,059
assessing those pools that is a very

488
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:17,519
tight tightly coupled system and it's

489
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,259
it's quite resistant to nitrogen losses

490
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,869
since it's occurring in the rises very

491
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,759
very small spatial scale and there are

492
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:25,949
other benefits such as some drought

493
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,329
resistance that can accrue as you build

494
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:33,450
organic matter pools okay how am i doing

495
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:37,139
I'm doing okay I'm gonna move on to talk

496
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,370
about nitrogen fixation and specifically

497
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,590
I'm going to focus on some of our

498
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:42,329
on-farm work that mega japan ski did

499
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:45,079
when she was here doing her doctoral

500
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:47,490
research and we start out with

501
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,589
originally when farmers were asking lots

502
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,210
of questions about nitrogen fixation how

503
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,709
much nitrogen they thought they would be

504
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,230
getting from these green manures

505
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,200
we went to the literature because I was

506
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,640
not doing research on nitrogen fixation

507
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,190
we found that there was just very little

508
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,650
information particularly on the kinds of

509
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,360
legumes that were being used as dream

510
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,519
manure crops there's a lot on soybeans

511
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,309
not too much in farmer's fields there a

512
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:14,069
fair amount on alfalfa but for many of

513
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,869
the species that farmers are using in in

514
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:19,109
the Northeast there was just very little

515
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:24,169
data so we started by looking at

516
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:26,250
nitrogen fixation in organic rain and

517
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,960
vegetable systems and also some

518
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,119
conventional systems so nitrogen

519
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,309
fixation really should be the primary

520
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,929
source of nitrogen for organic farming

521
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:37,679
because haber-bosch nitrogen is

522
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:39,720
forbidden when farms use composts from

523
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,870
conventional agriculture they're

524
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,950
actually you know subsidized through

525
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:46,199
synthetic nitrogen but it's you know

526
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,870
it's allowed because they are recycling

527
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,120
a waste but the reliance on nitrogen

528
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:53,819
fixation is even worse in organic

529
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,019
vegetable systems and there's a number

530
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:56,879
of reasons for this I'm not going to

531
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,609
talk about that now so we have this huge

532
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,950
range just in organic systems in terms

533
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:04,979
of how well they're managing and using

534
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:09,240
nitrogen fixation when we look at the

535
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,710
impact of this on the the balances we

536
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,690
see that it really doesn't matter

537
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,980
whether you're talking about haber-bosch

538
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,440
nitrogen or

539
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,558
pose if you're relying on those kind of

540
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,288
inputs and using very little nitrogen

541
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,269
fixation you tend to have larger

542
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:26,730
surpluses these are the organic grain

543
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,649
systems that have much higher proportion

544
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,690
of nitrogen coming from nitrogen

545
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:33,388
fixation

546
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,220
so these organic vegetable systems are

547
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:36,569
creating an environmental problem as

548
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,069
well even though they're using a

549
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:40,200
different source of nitrogen they are

550
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:42,658
operating they may there may be a delay

551
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,850
in the rate of nitrogen loss but

552
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,350
eventually those systems will become

553
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:48,599
saturated even though they're adding

554
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:50,939
some carbon and also they tend to have

555
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:55,079
really an over application of phosphorus

556
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,820
to in these cases so we were very

557
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,949
interested in looking at how differences

558
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:01,109
in soil fertility impact nitrogen

559
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,110
fixation we also wanted to understand

560
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:06,298
how planting the legume either as as a

561
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:09,509
monoculture or with interceded grasses

562
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:12,408
impacted nitrogen fixation we expected

563
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:15,869
that in fields and this was done in

564
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:18,179
regional farms in the Finger Lakes with

565
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,888
you know variations in their history of

566
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,190
management we expected those that have a

567
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:25,859
legacy of using legumes would have

568
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,570
higher soil organic nitrogen pools and

569
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,189
that there may be some suppression of

570
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:31,829
nitrogen fixation because if you have

571
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,320
more nitrogen available in the soil then

572
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:36,178
normally the leggings down regulate

573
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,398
nitrogen fixation because it is so

574
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,460
energy intensive

575
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,288
we also expected that when the in leaves

576
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,889
red clover in this particular experiment

577
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:48,929
that red clover planted with the wheat

578
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:51,269
interceded with the wheat may fix

579
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,159
nitrogen at a higher rate but it might

580
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:56,009
end up fixing less total nitrogen

581
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,260
because of reduced growth so maybe

582
00:24:56,009 --> 00:25:00,379
competition from shading for example

583
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,049
could end up reducing the total

584
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,320
Thanks these are some of the things that

585
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:10,490
we we thought we would see so we in this

586
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:12,379
experiment one central piece was to look

587
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,289
at the frost seeding of red clover into

588
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,030
winter grains grains and evaluate the

589
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,859
performance of that practice because

590
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:21,319
this is a very important practice in

591
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,000
organic grain systems and it has many

592
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:26,419
benefits in terms of keeping the soil

593
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,069
covered and reducing tillage so in order

594
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,320
to do this for those of you who aren't

595
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,960
familiar you start with wheat in the

596
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,710
winter and the legumes the red clover is

597
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,690
frost seeded germinates in the spring

598
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,480
canopy closes and it stops growing for a

599
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,090
while until harvest takes place there's

600
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,029
a small campaign and then after harvest

601
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:49,039
when the grains removed it fills the

602
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:52,250
field you have a field of sand a red

603
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,859
clover that could be cut but it is used

604
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:59,420
as the green manure for nitrogen

605
00:25:54,859 --> 00:26:02,809
fertility for the following corn crop so

606
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,210
these these this research was conducted

607
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,849
by embedding replicated plots into

608
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,710
farmer's fields and I'm I'm not gonna go

609
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:15,169
through all the methods here if you have

610
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:17,809
questions ask me later on so we did find

611
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:21,350
that as the proportion of reliance on

612
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,299
nitrogen fixation increased that overall

613
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:25,009
nitrogen fertility increase and this is

614
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,599
from a number of measurements that

615
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,329
beginning with the inorganic poles

616
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:32,929
through some of the labile pools to the

617
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:35,000
total organic nitrogen pool because one

618
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,130
single measurement really isn't a very

619
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,160
good indicator indicator of nitrogen

620
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,750
availability in the soil but we didn't

621
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,519
see even though we had a fair amount of

622
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,650
variation we didn't see any suppression

623
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:49,639
of nitrogen fixation in the clover that

624
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:53,600
corresponded with increases in soil

625
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,580
fertility we did see some significant

626
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,819
impacts of the way the clover was

627
00:26:55,579 --> 00:27:02,990
planted with clover and a monoculture

628
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:04,549
having a lower fixation rate so in when

629
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,140
Curt clover was growing by itself

630
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:09,909
without a non legume as competition

631
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:13,230
it was able to take up more nitrogen

632
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:15,130
from the soil and fix less compared to

633
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,110
clover that has interceded with the

634
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,030
winter grain or clover planted with

635
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:21,069
orchard grass and this was our other

636
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:23,399
comparison this is the Parma practice

637
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:28,539
this was clover planted with a perennial

638
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:30,820
grass however when we looked at the

639
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:32,529
total nitrogen fixed we found that it

640
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:34,990
was actually highest in the farmer

641
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:37,210
practice because well the rate of

642
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,730
nitrogen fixation increased but there

643
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,710
was no reduction in total biomass

644
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,079
production of the clover

645
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,390
we're so close and a monoculture had a

646
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,299
great biomass but not as much nitrogen

647
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:52,000
from fixation clover with orchard grass

648
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,009
had a higher rate but a significant

649
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,839
suppression in the overall growth or

650
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:58,480
biomass production and that ended up

651
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,459
reducing the nitrogen fix so from the

652
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,860
perspective well the farmers are doing

653
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,990
the right the right thing in terms of

654
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:10,119
managing clover in these systems and

655
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:12,579
managing nitrogen fixation so we start

656
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,859
with brain farms because they're a lot

657
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:17,949
simpler to do this kind of work in they

658
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,929
have similar crops they're located on

659
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,600
some similar soils where is the organic

660
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,549
vegetable systems where we we have a lot

661
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,769
of problems and managing nitrogen

662
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:28,899
fixation and farmers have there's a lot

663
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:31,599
of interests on the part of farmers and

664
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:34,420
work that will serve inform their

665
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,879
management we were working up to them

666
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,740
but in the grain farms we found some

667
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,570
very variability in soil nitrogen

668
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,900
fertility but it's below the threshold

669
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:45,429
for nitrogen for BNF suppression and

670
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,080
this is not the case in vegetable

671
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,970
systems we know that fertility is high

672
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:53,220
enough that it is suppressing nitrogen

673
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:56,950
fixation in some of these farms a

674
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,990
strategy that uses interceding in a way

675
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,450
that minimizes competition between the

676
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,630
legumes and the non legumes is really an

677
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,549
optimal strategy you get the benefits of

678
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,590
competition for soil nitrogen and you

679
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,259
know reduce nitrogen availability to up

680
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:13,480
the fixation rate but since their growth

681
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:15,549
has staggered that gives the clover a

682
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,849
chance to grow without competition for

683
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:20,259
light and this on farm work and we have

684
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:22,149
some work we've done in vegetables

685
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,490
systems as the basis for the next phase

686
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,920
of research and cover crop mixtures that

687
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,620
Emily will be carrying out she talked a

688
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,350
little bit about that

689
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:35,829
ok I'm on the last project I'm actually

690
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:37,629
doing ok I mean I thought 3 might be

691
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:42,250
pushing it but I know two just seemed

692
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:43,720
you know three nice around ok so I'm

693
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,000
gonna talk a little bit about the

694
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,769
interdisciplinary project that used the

695
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,589
Mississippi River Basin and the problem

696
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:53,349
of hypoxia sort of a case study to try

697
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:57,059
to understand how the linkages across

698
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:59,589
the social ecological interface drive

699
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,829
agricultural management regimes land use

700
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:05,079
and intensification and you can imagine

701
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:08,289
here's the research team and their

702
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:12,309
institutions and various specialties

703
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:14,619
that this is a complex project and we

704
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:17,769
all complain those of us that do this

705
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:19,750
work that even we're always you know at

706
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:22,059
meetings giving talks in 15 or 20

707
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,559
minutes which is really hard for these

708
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:25,480
kinds of projects but I'm going to just

709
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,629
pick a couple of things to show as

710
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,430
examples to maybe pique your interests

711
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,950
and get you interested in doing this

712
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,830
kind of work it does take time but it's

713
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,799
been a really valuable experience I've

714
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:42,309
learned a lot from people from the you

715
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:45,750
know the cross disciplines so the

716
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:48,490
Mississippi River Basin epitomizes an

717
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:51,160
intensive industrial system that is high

718
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:54,220
yielding it is one of the most important

719
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,900
food production systems in the world the

720
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,730
last statistic I have which might be

721
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,250
have gone down a little bit as

722
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,559
production expands out into developing

723
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,660
countries was nearly 80% of the world's

724
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,379
feed grains come from the Mississippi

725
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:10,779
River Basin and there is an extensive

726
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,000
network of research and extension and

727
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:14,649
government policies that support this

728
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,720
agricultural system and there's also

729
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,720
some very significant

730
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
consequences

731
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:24,558
the main one being that you've probably

732
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:27,288
are familiar with is the dead zone or

733
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:30,519
the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico

734
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:32,749
and so far although there have been some

735
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,868
improvements and fertilizer use

736
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:39,889
efficiency in these systems so far it

737
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:41,839
hasn't impacted the nitrate levels in

738
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:45,408
streams draining the basement or the

739
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,028
hypoxic zone so this is this year's the

740
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:49,340
size of this year zone they tack it

741
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:51,169
every year it's smaller than predicted

742
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:53,538
and they've got some ideas about why

743
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,980
that is but it's right just barely above

744
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:57,440
the five year average so we're not

745
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,089
seeing a you know a trend downward yet

746
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,899
and there's some ideas about why there

747
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:05,058
might be some lags in this system so the

748
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:07,488
two overarching questions of this

749
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:09,710
project one of the key social ecological

750
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:12,139
linkages governing the current

751
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,538
agricultural systems and how could these

752
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:16,488
linkages be modified to expand the

753
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:20,538
ecosystem services delivered by this

754
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:22,759
this agricultural system I'm going to

755
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:25,128
talk specifically about some work that

756
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,048
was done in collaboration with Stephen

757
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:31,219
loaf and his graduate students Stephanie

758
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:32,808
- angle Ike Meyer and so one way that

759
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,329
this is framed is to look for evidence

760
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:37,788
of adaptive coupling which is defined as

761
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:43,368
an appropriate response to environmental

762
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:45,048
degradation so one question that was

763
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:47,358
addressed in the project our resource is

764
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:50,569
targeting the regions that are

765
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:52,699
responsible for the hypoxia and I'm

766
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:56,599
going to talk about research resources

767
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,278
and then the policy driven incentives so

768
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,719
first we need to look at well where are

769
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:01,730
the nitrogen loss that's coming from

770
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,298
they're ending up in the Gulf this is

771
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:09,259
work done with Mark David using County

772
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:12,019
level nitrogen budgets and when we run

773
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:14,358
that analysis we find that you know the

774
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,909
losses the greatest losses occurred here

775
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:20,269
in this blue zone and as color gets

776
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:23,600
lighter they get lower and lower and so

777
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:25,109
these losses are driven by the intensity

778
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,759
of the agriculture the

779
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:29,969
there was a proportion of the area

780
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,789
that's in corn fertilizer rates and the

781
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,980
presence of tile drainage and this turns

782
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:36,089
out to be a real key factor separating

783
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,589
out what tile drainage is it was

784
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:41,789
invented in New York anybody not know oh

785
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:44,490
there okay I'll tell you what it is then

786
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,289
basically it's installing these pipes

787
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,720
which used to be made out of tile now

788
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:51,509
they're made out of plastic about a

789
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,819
meter down in the soil the depth varies

790
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,259
depending on soil type and they have

791
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,928
holes their prints drain

792
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:59,609
so in these heavy soils which are you

793
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:02,220
know many are former wetland soils it

794
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:04,168
provides drainage so the water instead

795
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,630
of standing percolates down into these

796
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:08,789
drains and then moves out of the field

797
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,480
underground into a bunch of drainage

798
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:14,279
ditches that surround there's a network

799
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,500
so this has a huge impact on

800
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,570
productivity and this was really what

801
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,429
enabled some of these wetland soils

802
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,809
which are high in organic matter to

803
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:27,510
become hugely productive for these crops

804
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:30,239
okay so let's look at the resources in

805
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:34,080
terms of research so for this we

806
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,689
analyzed the USDA Chris database and we

807
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,418
analyzed ten years of data looking at

808
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,878
profit projects that related to nitrogen

809
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,099
management and Stephanie use that

810
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:49,710
typology that I mentioned earlier end of

811
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:51,628
pipe fertilizer and ecological and first

812
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,519
of all she looked at the amount going to

813
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:56,190
different regions so here's the Corn

814
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:59,789
Belt that's where the problem is

815
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,780
here's the Gulf of Mexico States they're

816
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:06,269
the recipients of the problem and a

817
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:10,400
greater amount of research on nitrogen

818
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:13,650
management is going to the problem area

819
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,039
recipients not the people making the

820
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:19,050
problem so it was interesting and this

821
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,009
was that was actually one of Stephen

822
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,720
Watts prediction so if we look at the

823
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,780
temporal trend in investment we see a

824
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,439
similar thing

825
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,150
this is for the Gulf states where

826
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,579
overall total investments going up in

827
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,039
the Corn Belt states where the overall

828
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:37,679
investment is going down so this is just

829
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,849
one database it's just the crisp

830
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,399
national database we would have really

831
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:43,750
liked to look at state budgets for

832
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,190
research but that's pretty much

833
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,139
impossible and that is one of the

834
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,670
problems that we found is that there are

835
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:51,879
many things that would help us to

836
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:54,550
understand how well we're doing in terms

837
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,740
of tackling this problem but the data is

838
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,240
simply not available and a lot of this

839
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:02,079
is data more in the social system

840
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:05,559
resource allocation for example okay so

841
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,590
the second sort of resource allocation

842
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:10,449
question has to do with the incentives

843
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,280
that are generated by our aggregate

844
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:15,159
aggregate environmental policies and so

845
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,960
this is the farm bill which is slated to

846
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,230
change if they ever passed another one

847
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,119
however the proposed insurance based

848
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:27,010
incentives will actually parallel the

849
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,199
commodity sort of yield subsidy based

850
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:32,410
incentives in terms of the farms that

851
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:34,569
qualify for them so what we found if you

852
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:38,949
can remember the dark areas contributing

853
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:41,490
to hypoxia is that the payments for crop

854
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:44,079
production naturally are going

855
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:45,879
predominantly to the areas that have the

856
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,739
high yields and are the most intensified

857
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,730
but they're also the areas that are

858
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,399
contributing to environmental

859
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:55,030
degradation if we look at conservation

860
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,760
payments we see just the opposite where

861
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:00,220
those areas that are really productive

862
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,140
and have the high corn yields and also

863
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:05,069
are the most leaky and contributing most

864
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:07,389
of the nitrogen to the streams are not

865
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,550
interested in conservation payments

866
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:12,309
which tend to be less so this is not

867
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:15,580
nearly as lucrative as the crop payments

868
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:19,449
now there's a lot of things going on

869
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:24,340
within the policy world and in NRCS to

870
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:26,829
try to correct this situation so this is

871
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,870
not people are aware that if you have a

872
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:31,750
high yielding farm you've got fertile

873
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:33,429
soils most of the conservation options

874
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,610
that are going to improve your nitrogen

875
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:38,049
management just are not economically

876
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:42,039
appealing to you and that's something

877
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:45,670
that can be addressed through policy so

878
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:48,429
we're in the midst of doing some work

879
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:51,250
with this database of this county level

880
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:54,009
database that has all the agricultural

881
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:57,250
practices fertilizer use and all of that

882
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:00,430
information by combining it with the

883
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:04,059
crop protic the soil productivity index

884
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:07,659
that's been developed by NRCS and data

885
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:10,329
from the census of Ag the economic

886
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:15,789
census and the what is it the new one

887
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:18,309
community American Community Survey yes

888
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:20,469
now we have a new beyond beyond the

889
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:23,409
census we have a new survey that

890
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:25,739
captures socio-economic data from

891
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:28,089
communities so we're in the midst of

892
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,429
taking the next step with this to try to

893
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:33,070
understand how the biophysical

894
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:34,839
environment impacts agricultural

895
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,280
structure and whether or not and ask

896
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,070
whether or not there are cascading

897
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,190
effects for rural communities and the

898
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,870
questions we're looking at here how does

899
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,659
the biophysical setting influence

900
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:49,150
agricultural intensification and the

901
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:51,250
response of agriculture to policy market

902
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,019
signals so we know about you know the

903
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,059
counties that are actually receiving

904
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:57,400
payments we know about their impact on

905
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:59,619
environment in the environment and the

906
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,900
structure of their agriculture we want

907
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:04,000
to ask is it going to the next level up

908
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,160
of the community the soil fertility

909
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,449
influence the socio economics of rural

910
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:12,118
communities in intensified landscapes

911
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:14,730
we actually didn't think there would be

912
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,920
very much of an impact given you know

913
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,719
the the high degree of industrialization

914
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,680
of the system and it's it's you know

915
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:25,169
reliance on technologies and inputs to

916
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,480
produce yield so I'm just gonna show you

917
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,940
a couple of plots of the data we will be

918
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,679
doing some multivariate analyses of this

919
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,960
data because that's really the only way

920
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:38,279
that you can analyze this sort of a

921
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,949
complex data set but the initial

922
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,079
correlations look promising so yes corn

923
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,750
yields are higher in the soils that have

924
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,298
the higher productivity potential index

925
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:52,980
so that made me feel good about the NRCS

926
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:55,289
index and we see that intensification so

927
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,980
this is a question about if we compare

928
00:39:55,289 --> 00:40:03,710
the corn acreage in this period in the

929
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:06,838
1960s to corn acreage from 2002 to 2006

930
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,670
how how the change has been on a county

931
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,949
level basis so if they're down here in

932
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,990
the negative we lost corn acreage if

933
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:15,118
they're up here we gained corn acreage

934
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:17,818
so from this you can see that

935
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,530
intensification is continuing and it's

936
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:22,798
continuing in those counties that are

937
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:25,470
already the most intensively managed and

938
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:27,030
are also the problems from the problem

939
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:30,838
counties from an environmental impact

940
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:34,410
perspective so the policies are

941
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,029
continuing to foster and exacerbate the

942
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:40,710
environmental degradation that is

943
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:42,920
currently occurring and then if we look

944
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:46,318
at some of the relationships between

945
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,150
productivity and economic outcomes first

946
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,150
looking at the percent of farms

947
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:54,599
reporting losses we find an inverse

948
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,880
relationship so the proportion of farms

949
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,539
that report losses in high fertility

950
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,318
soils is much lower compared to those

951
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,298
that are in the lower fertility soils

952
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,519
and in this relationships was even

953
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,940
stronger than the relationship to corn

954
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,219
yield

955
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,260
suggesting that the policies that were

956
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,849
using the incentive

957
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,200
that reward yields actually exacerbate

958
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:21,589
differences that are occurring due to

959
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:25,699
the differences in soil fertility and

960
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:27,710
then this last one is looking at the

961
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:29,629
impact of soil fertility on the number

962
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,300
of families living below the poverty

963
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,160
level so the question is does this

964
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,590
difference in soil fertility and farm

965
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,589
structure and you know the intensity of

966
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,500
Agriculture the incentives that you know

967
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:44,150
are passed down from the agro

968
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,389
environmental policy does that impact

969
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,430
the broader community and and we see

970
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:52,969
that there is a correlation of our

971
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:55,789
square root of 0.29 with lower rates of

972
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:57,889
poverty related to the high fertility

973
00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:01,309
soils I mean this is commonly seen in

974
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:03,230
subsistence agriculture but I was kind

975
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:06,110
of surprised to see I mean that's a

976
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,659
pretty strong relationship so the the

977
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,400
work that we're doing with this database

978
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:12,440
which were we're building we're adding

979
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,410
other variables in will be will be

980
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,700
looking at this relationship between

981
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:22,789
soil fertility access to to amenities so

982
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:24,230
shopping in grocery stores medical

983
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:26,889
facilities and those kinds of things

984
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,690
because the the syrup type has been that

985
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:32,629
people that live in counties well based

986
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:38,329
on stereotype 8 on some research in

987
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:40,369
California we expected that counties

988
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,349
with the highest productivity and the

989
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:45,109
greatest intensification would have

990
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:47,119
overall lower or reduced quality of life

991
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:50,180
based on the immunities available

992
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,579
because you have a depopulation of the

993
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:54,339
counties where you've got lots of

994
00:42:52,579 --> 00:43:02,690
agriculture

995
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm sorry yeah it's it's based on census

996
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,720
data so it's all families in the county

997
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,550
so it'll be people working in

998
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,549
agriculture and everybody else

999
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:26,089
well and I this is only rural counties

1000
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:28,340
yes yeah and that's a you know this is

1001
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,470
just the first course analysis we have

1002
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,079
to look at a lot of per capita questions

1003
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:34,759
right yeah because if you if you leave

1004
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,889
the urban counties and it really

1005
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,230
confuses things because urbanization

1006
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:42,889
tends to occur where the more fertile

1007
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,570
soils are so that you know really throws

1008
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:50,000
a wrench in yeah so from now we've left

1009
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:51,710
those out okay yeah so to summarize what

1010
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,809
we what we found so far from this

1011
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,309
project and it's I'm mostly limited it

1012
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:58,940
to some of the the results that I

1013
00:43:55,309 --> 00:44:01,670
presented so looking at this as a system

1014
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,829
it's evident that maladaptive coupling

1015
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,559
dominates in other words the way the

1016
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:09,559
system is responding to policies really

1017
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,509
at a national level that that keep

1018
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:13,880
pushing it on its current trajectory of

1019
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,640
intensification and of you know

1020
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,500
production or yield as the main focus

1021
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:20,900
some counties have actually taken steps

1022
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,760
to try to reverse that trend at the

1023
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,410
county level because they realize that

1024
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,990
they're they're losing their communities

1025
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:28,849
and so there are incentives such as five

1026
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:32,119
years of no taxes if you convert to

1027
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:33,949
organic farming and certain counties

1028
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,619
have implemented programs where they

1029
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:38,689
preferentially buy produce from local

1030
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:40,250
farms in order to provide a market

1031
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,440
because if you're out in the Midwest you

1032
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:46,039
really are tied to the global market for

1033
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,019
the most part so if this is due in part

1034
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:50,300
to these commodity payments that support

1035
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:53,119
support mainly corn soybean production

1036
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,850
and sort of leap over and you know swamp

1037
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,949
or just completely you know overwhelm

1038
00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:01,519
any local initiatives for the most part

1039
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:03,259
and this and this intensification is

1040
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,239
particularly pronounced in the areas

1041
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,770
that are you know really mainly

1042
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:11,519
responsible for nitrogen loss and

1043
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:13,409
in the Gulf of Mexico and if we look at

1044
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:17,190
this research and policies there's sort

1045
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:19,710
of a you know an irrational allocation

1046
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:23,789
of resources at this point which needs

1047
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:28,500
to be corrected ok here's my final slide

1048
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:30,900
oh I made it in time so ok so how can we

1049
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,789
reduce nitrogen well of course I think

1050
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,980
that we need to exploit ecological

1051
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:36,779
processes and this this will be a

1052
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,530
challenge because there are many

1053
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,780
barriers that exist in institutions and

1054
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:44,460
you know if government policies I've you

1055
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,380
know if you meet with economists they

1056
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,199
like a single number they don't like a

1057
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,190
complex sort of you know decision matrix

1058
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,539
of a than B or if C then go to Z they

1059
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,240
don't like any of that they don't like

1060
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:59,519
interactions and but of course what

1061
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,259
we're doing when we use these ecological

1062
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,259
approaches is we're trying to take

1063
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,970
advantage of these interactions that

1064
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,970
actually drive the system in the

1065
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:11,339
direction we want to go to have multiple

1066
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:13,559
benefits so more than yield you know to

1067
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,690
deal with water quality to increase soil

1068
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:17,880
organic matter and the sort of cascade

1069
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:21,300
of positive outcomes that are offered

1070
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,860
there so I don't think that haber-bosch

1071
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,490
nitrogen is going to go away I think

1072
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:28,740
it's an important tool and we should be

1073
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:31,259
strategic about how we use it because

1074
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:33,689
you know while we still have cheap

1075
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,450
fossil fuels and we can supplement with

1076
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,599
solar based technologies that could be a

1077
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:42,269
key strategy for transitioning

1078
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,339
agriculture towards sustainability and

1079
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:46,880
I'd be happy to answer any questions

1080
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,880
thank you

1081
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:08,869
okay sorry I was disoriented for a

1082
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,579
minute it sounded like you were coming

1083
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,579
from above yes

1084
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:28,480
therefore it seems like that

1085
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,420
I would be

1086
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:40,880
well you know there's a lot of people

1087
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:42,860
talking about changing diet I mean 40

1088
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,000
percent right now 40 percent of the corn

1089
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:49,490
is going to ethanol so you know that is

1090
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,980
an issue we export a huge amount for the

1091
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:54,349
grain I mean for feed grain so it's a

1092
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,380
really a global diet issue not you know

1093
00:47:54,349 --> 00:48:00,619
not just our own diets so I think that

1094
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:04,960
you know there are some challenges but I

1095
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:07,579
also believe that I think that we could

1096
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,269
increase the diversity of our landscape

1097
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:13,639
without taking a huge hit in yield one

1098
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:15,199
strategy would be to substitute wheat as

1099
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:17,960
one of the feed grains which is already

1100
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:21,169
happening in organic systems for a

1101
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,789
variety of reasons so this you know part

1102
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,460
of the problem is this complete reliance

1103
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:28,099
on corn soybean of course I am a strong

1104
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,440
advocate of you know eating meat in

1105
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:33,289
moderation recognizing that you know

1106
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,679
it's ecological cost but I think that

1107
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:38,989
that is a you know a much broader

1108
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:41,960
challenging cultural question certainly

1109
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:44,419
we should not be encouraging meat

1110
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,070
production to be you know cheap I mean

1111
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,309
we should try to incorporate the real

1112
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,840
cost into different foods so rather than

1113
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:52,820
have our government you know try to

1114
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,400
subsidize the production of meat and

1115
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,500
other animal products so that they are

1116
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,840
inexpensive maybe you know some way to

1117
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,059
balance and I think a lot of the work on

1118
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:05,809
ecosystem services is looking at you

1119
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:07,820
know how can we monetize and get some

1120
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:09,980
actual you know cost that reflects the

1121
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,650
true environmental costs or that the

1122
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,679
things that we have externalized so that

1123
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:19,480
is a very good question and it's more

1124
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,480
than I can answer in two minutes

1125
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:30,668
oh my god must have encouraged this

1126
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:53,190
well I think that I do think that we

1127
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:55,798
should continue to provide incentives or

1128
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:58,528
subsidies for agriculture I think it's

1129
00:49:55,798 --> 00:50:00,690
different than other industries and I

1130
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:03,329
think that we want to keep as many

1131
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,740
people in farming as we can or as we

1132
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:07,079
have right now I don't think people want

1133
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:09,689
to continue to go down the road of you

1134
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,940
know reducing the number of farmers even

1135
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:14,159
more and and having farms you know

1136
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,630
increase in size there's no evidence

1137
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,548
suggesting that that's really going to

1138
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,838
improve their ecological efficiency and

1139
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:22,048
there's questions about the value in

1140
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:24,210
terms of production outcomes a nitrogen

1141
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:26,579
tax is is something that's been on the

1142
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,949
table and I think that Europe the iou's

1143
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:31,349
EU has gone that way and in certain

1144
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:36,179
respects putting caps on nitrogen

1145
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:37,920
fertilizer rates I actually think that

1146
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:41,278
experimenting with a couple of those

1147
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,039
kinds of tools to sort of help the

1148
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:45,630
transition begin one might be rewarding

1149
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:48,210
farmers for cover which is something

1150
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:50,039
that NRCS is trying to do so they do

1151
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,349
haven't small incentive program for

1152
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:57,599
cover you know increasing your coverage

1153
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:59,700
reducing their fallows I think that in

1154
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,500
certain places no-till is reasonable and

1155
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:04,018
combined with cover cropping it can be

1156
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,940
valuable policies that would encourage

1157
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:08,578
the integration of animal and crop

1158
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,200
production so that they're not spatially

1159
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,329
separated and distinct from one another

1160
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:15,419
could have a lot of benefits that you

1161
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:17,539
know the ultimately if the most

1162
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,970
efficient rotation is one that includes

1163
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:23,460
crops that relate to animal production

1164
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:27,149
so pulling forages out of the grain

1165
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:28,559
systems is one thing that's led to a lot

1166
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:32,838
of the problems that we have in those

1167
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,839
systems so that could be a key thing

1168
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,730
applying fertilizer careful

1169
00:51:52,699 --> 00:52:01,179
so when you go to the legumes they have

1170
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,179
problems with adjusting

1171
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,800
okay

1172
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:14,250
well you know first of all I don't think

1173
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,010
that the responsibility can all fall on

1174
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:19,199
farmers because the systems that they

1175
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,000
have now that are dependent on the

1176
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,848
technology that's been developed to

1177
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,338
support this intensification actually

1178
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:29,730
make it more difficult to the you know

1179
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:31,739
backtrack and add diversity in so there

1180
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,119
needs to be some you know work at the

1181
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:35,629
higher level and there needs to be

1182
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,400
research on how to go back to using

1183
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,500
biodiversity in a way that makes sense

1184
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,500
strategically and results in these

1185
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,530
multiple benefits in terms of managing

1186
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,449
legumes though one benefit because

1187
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,740
you're impacting so many processes is

1188
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:52,259
that you don't have to manage them as

1189
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:53,969
closely because you do you build up the

1190
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,339
labile organic matter pools so we just

1191
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:58,169
did a pilot experiment with a you know

1192
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:01,529
soil from a conventional field soil from

1193
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:05,280
an organic field 20 years-plus of

1194
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:07,079
organic management and about the the

1195
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,269
wheat took up about twice as much

1196
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:12,119
nitrogen from the organic soil and was

1197
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:14,369
able to produce you know a yield that

1198
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,930
was twice as high as the wheat from the

1199
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:19,079
conventional so even though we added

1200
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:22,769
some you know small amount of legumes

1201
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:24,539
residue so initially it's more of a

1202
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:26,519
challenge but you can always supplement

1203
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,529
legumes with fertilizer you don't you

1204
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,809
know how different less you're aiming

1205
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,280
for organic certification so the farmer

1206
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:33,568
was interested in legumes I would tell

1207
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,579
them I mean I would give them

1208
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:37,889
recommendations about the legging to fit

1209
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,109
into their niche you know the open spot

1210
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:42,389
they've gotten their rotation and then

1211
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:45,389
maybe talk to them about how to eyeball

1212
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:49,190
it and be prepared to add some

1213
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:49,190
fertilizer to get them through

1214
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:55,478
right I think once that you've been

1215
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:58,719
managing your soils in our climate

1216
00:53:55,478 --> 00:54:03,009
organically for at least ten years that

1217
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:05,199
if you have a low stand of clover you're

1218
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:06,938
you you could potentially get away with

1219
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,429
it I mean you might want to supplement

1220
00:54:06,938 --> 00:54:12,159
but I mean there's still not a lot of

1221
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:15,219
data on that and you know what how to

1222
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:17,889
sell type interact with management in

1223
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:20,289
terms of rebuilding these labile pools

1224
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:23,199
but it's definitely some of these more

1225
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:25,449
labile pools that are available to

1226
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,789
plants that are being impacted which is

1227
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:30,338
what we want to do now one question is

1228
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:33,429
since these plant these soils do have

1229
00:54:30,338 --> 00:54:35,650
greater capacity to mineralize nitrogen

1230
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:38,469
you know are they going to be more prone

1231
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:41,798
to leakiness our cover crops enough to

1232
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:43,838
capture that nitrogen so we really have

1233
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:46,478
to be we really have to avoid bear fouls

1234
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,608
if we're going to build up these organic

1235
00:54:46,478 --> 00:54:50,879
matter pools we could have other

1236
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,880
problems

1237
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,800
