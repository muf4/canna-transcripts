00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,649
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,769
University

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,400
hello and welcome to common diseases in

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,400
the garden

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,868
so I just picked up about a dirty dozen

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,910
or so of diseases that you're likely to

7
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:22,789
find where if you work on the grow liner

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,419
in your own garden and

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:29,429
they represent an array of

10
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:31,949
diseases that were some you see the

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,710
signs of the disease and some you see

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,450
the symptoms of the disease

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,429
and so let's just run through them very

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,699
quickly you're certainly not expected to

15
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,370
memorize them but just to have a feeling

16
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:47,988
for the diversity of diseases that

17
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,988
you'll find in the landscape

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,929
the first disease I wanted to go over

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,329
was powdery mildew funny mildew is one

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,579
of the easier diseases to identify

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,239
because there's a rightist sized which

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,978
is actually part of the fungi

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,750
that

24
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:08,870
covers the leaves usually on the top of

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,659
the leaves and it's actually a group of

26
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,540
fungi it's not just one specific one but

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:20,359
they all have specific host ranges so

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,360
they're ones that hit lilacs crab

29
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:27,359
zinnias dogwoods roses they are they're

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,090
all susceptible to powdery mildew and if

31
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,280
we have a cool

32
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:36,120
spring and summer it's we're almost

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,609
assured of seeing this disease so the

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,740
fungal hyphae

35
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:43,920
infect the outermost leaves and then

36
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,629
insert essentially their mouth part as

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,840
it were although they don't have a mouth

38
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:51,979
but the feeding part into the cells and

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,549
they feed off of the

40
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,170
photosynthate that the plant makes

41
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,689
as I mentioned the disease is much more

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,290
prevalent when it there's periods of

43
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,349
high humidity and rainfall so in terms

44
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,920
of a management issue you want to keep

45
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,989
the foliage as dry as possible so

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,048
certainly if you think that you have a

47
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,719
plant that's likely to get powdery

48
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,269
mildew let's say like a bed of

49
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:25,019
try not to overhead water those plants

50
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,750
try to water them so that the leaves

51
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,789
don't get wet

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:34,378
most of the time party mode is an

53
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:38,608
aesthetic issue not not so much a plant

54
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:41,639
health issue but it can be quite quite

55
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:44,909
bad looking I have found that party

56
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,889
mother on dog woods can go into the

57
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:48,469
stems and and cause sort of a

58
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,179
physiological

59
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:55,128
problem for for dog woods but otherwise

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,129
it just it's just unsightly

61
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:04,169
okay if you are a small home footballer

62
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:06,688
and specifically apples you're likely to

63
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,899
be dealing with apple scab it's

64
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:10,969
certainly one of the main

65
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,620
diseases that

66
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,318
orchardists have to deal with and it

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,658
causes small

68
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,818
spots on the leaves no big deal but it

69
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:23,729
also

70
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:25,759
causes spots on the apples it was out a

71
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:29,009
call from my

72
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:31,459
pathology 101 class with dr. Sinclair

73
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:34,318
who literally wrote the book on diseases

74
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,289
it doesn't affect the taste of the apple

75
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,448
at all it's just a surface thing that of

76
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:41,009
course if you were looking to buy an

77
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,349
apple that looked like that on the right

78
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:46,828
you you wouldn't buy it so it makes them

79
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:48,179
unsellable the fungus overwinters on

80
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,439
leaves that have dropped to the ground

81
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:56,479
and and hang around and serve as the

82
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,699
inoculum source for the next year's

83
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,159
infection and

84
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,560
there's there's a whole there's actually

85
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,358
software that's written to healthy time

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,348
if you are a professional orchardist

87
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:12,719
when you have to spray your plants

88
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:15,469
to prevent apple scab but for the home

89
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,658
orchardist especially if you're starting

90
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:20,699
an orchard it's really great if you can

91
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,889
select a resistant varieties it's going

92
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,620
to help

93
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,668
reduce the amount of

94
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,269
management effort that you're going to

95
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:31,978
have to have to have good apples

96
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,019
and that if you you know have an apple

97
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,029
tree already and you don't want to have

98
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,038
apple scab where you want to limit it

99
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,228
there are fungicides that you can use

100
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,449
and basically there's not a

101
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,339
one-size-fits-all

102
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,020
prescription for fungicide because it

103
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,448
really depends on the weather and then

104
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:52,129
you might want to avail yourself of some

105
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:55,710
of the Cornell apple scab software

106
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:58,439
programs so that you know when to spray

107
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:03,409
this could because this is a major issue

108
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,410
for for apple apple growers

109
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,039
going right from apples to strawberries

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:17,129
gray mold botrytis is

111
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:21,418
like powdery mildew the many botrytis

112
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,959
fungi and that they are characterized by

113
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:28,019
having this sort of gray

114
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,908
mold that is that easily comes off the

115
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,908
plant you can see in the picture on the

116
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:34,560
right there's the straw there's two good

117
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:36,509
strawberry sort of one on top of each

118
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,639
other and then just to the right of it

119
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,460
is a great moral defective strawberry

120
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,129
and you can see that the pattern of

121
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:47,519
spores have just sort of fallen off and

122
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:50,430
landed on the leaf reinfect another part

123
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,319
of the plant and botrytis unfortunately

124
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,319
affects a lot of different herbaceous

125
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,629
plants and like powdery mildew is

126
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,848
favored and cool wet springs and cool

127
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:02,430
summers of course you'll find that

128
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:05,848
that's true with our diseases a hot dry

129
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,560
year might be tough for the plants from

130
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,810
a lot of point of view but it's much

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,430
easier on them from a disease point of

132
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,620
view because a lot of diseases are

133
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,530
spread by

134
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,418
raindrops hitting the fungus releasing

135
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:21,269
the spores and the spores move to a new

136
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:24,689
part of the plant so anytime we have a

137
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:29,448
crew wet spring and a clue and wet ish

138
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:34,110
summer look to see a lot of diseases and

139
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:37,860
again people manage botrytis by trying

140
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,020
to not do much overhead watering of

141
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,729
course mother nature is going to going

142
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,799
to rain on the plants but if your

143
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:48,019
on a regular basis you'd want to water

144
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,228
just the base of the plant not the

145
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,228
leaves

146
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,968
Turks pot this is one of my favorite

147
00:06:55,838 --> 00:07:02,269
diseases because it's pretty hard to

148
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:05,058
miss diagnosed and the good news is even

149
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:06,918
though this looks really horrible it

150
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:10,580
actually has pretty much no effect on

151
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:13,188
the tree it hits maples and it hits the

152
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:15,528
maples in the late part of the growing

153
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,509
season and that's why it really doesn't

154
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:21,579
have that much effect it gets going and

155
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:24,580
it can be you know pretty amazingly

156
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,948
throughout the plant and you know these

157
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,448
vibrant tar-like spots all over the

158
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,189
leaves and these are actually small

159
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,490
sometimes they're even they're the size

160
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,319
of a quarter or larger

161
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,360
but because they hit the plant late in

162
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,759
the in the growing season there's really

163
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,088
no management and it's really no real

164
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,009
effect on the tree overall and that

165
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:49,098
would be true for a lot of the diseases

166
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,110
that hit late in the season you know yes

167
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:53,088
they don't it makes a plant unsightly

168
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,520
that it really doesn't have a

169
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:57,199
physiological effect on the plant the

170
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,359
diseases we worry about other ones that

171
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,999
had in the spring and so that they're

172
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,819
compromising the plant throughout the

173
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:07,939
growing season diseases that hit later

174
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,709
in the year that only you know hit the

175
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,050
tower spot hits and about a month later

176
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:15,370
the leaves are falling off anyway it's

177
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,370
not really a big problem

178
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,338
another one of my favorite diseases is

179
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,680
black not

180
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:27,620
black not hits proms Prue's and it's

181
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,490
especially cherries and it's this sort

182
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:34,940
of charcoal like swirling growth on the

183
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,680
twigs and the fungus infects the twigs

184
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,569
and then starts to sort of charcoal e

185
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,129
growth

186
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:42,740
and

187
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,948
it's really easy to see when the tree is

188
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,230
out of leaf it's actually harder to see

189
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:50,568
if you've got a decent-looking cherry

190
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,240
and it starts to get black not you might

191
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:55,969
not see it until the winter and when the

192
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,310
leaves drop out so there are resistance

193
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,689
variety so that would probably good idea

194
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:04,008
to do if you know you have a lot of

195
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:04,899
black knot in your area I certainly have

196
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,539
seen

197
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:11,568
in New York a lot more black not than I

198
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:13,099
see in Washington DC area I don't know

199
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,409
why but you seem to have a lot of black

200
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,509
not up here

201
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:20,448
you can prune out the affected twigs in

202
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:24,289
the winter although it might behoove you

203
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:25,878
to dip your pruners in some alcohol

204
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:29,769
between cuts just to make sure you're

205
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,769
not spreading it and

206
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:35,899
it can it can be just an aesthetic issue

207
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,299
but if it gets really going on the plant

208
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:40,058
it can take it out because essentially

209
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:43,248
the growth girdles the twig and

210
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:45,318
eventually that twig dies and so if

211
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:48,769
there are enough black mountain sections

212
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:52,099
throughout a cherry plum or prune it can

213
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,929
kill it so again always when you're

214
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,058
buying new plants look for disease

215
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:57,979
resistant varieties because diseases are

216
00:09:56,058 --> 00:10:00,438
hard to manage I don't think that

217
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,930
there's really management for black not

218
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:04,789
least I'm not aware of it except for

219
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:07,149
just cutting it out when you when you

220
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:07,149
see it

221
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,370
Tomatoes Tomatoes get a lot of diseases

222
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:19,698
and none of them are good and one of

223
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,610
them is devastating so the three that I

224
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:27,969
wanted to touch on our early blight

225
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:30,199
septoria leaf spot and then late blight

226
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,139
starting at the top right that's

227
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:35,659
septoria at least in my experience just

228
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,110
about every tomato plant on the lower

229
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:41,379
leaves starts to get septoria and

230
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,899
depending on how you manage the

231
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:47,449
disease like some people I would just go

232
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,519
in there religiously and strip out the

233
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:50,928
lower

234
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,959
leaves when they start getting septoria

235
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:55,568
to keep the infection to a minimum some

236
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,708
people just say oh well

237
00:10:55,568 --> 00:11:00,498
not to worry I'm going to get my

238
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:02,448
tomatoes and that's it so it's up to you

239
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:04,100
to decide whether you want to manage it

240
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:08,028
that way or if you want to spray a

241
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,940
fungicide to try to keep some toya to a

242
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:13,429
minimum but it seems to me that every

243
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:17,300
every tomato's gonna get it there are

244
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:21,309
bill resistant varieties but it seems

245
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:25,009
like it's ubiquitous and tomatoes

246
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:28,009
also somewhat ubiquitous is early blight

247
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:31,309
and early causes more of a necrosis with

248
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:34,519
septoria is spots or the bright has sort

249
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:37,659
of a motive that is more like margin

250
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,700
relief the closest and into necrosis of

251
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:44,629
the leaves and that can be pretty

252
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,690
serious and and really keep your tomato

253
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:49,958
harvest much smaller than it would be

254
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,180
without the early blight

255
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:56,328
but then there's the devastating late

256
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,778
blight and then late like ten ironically

257
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:01,578
come somewhat early in the season

258
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:04,539
but it tends to be a little bit later in

259
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:09,739
the season and it causes these like

260
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:12,019
dark anchors on the stems and then hits

261
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,490
the foliage and it can wipe out the

262
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:18,828
plant just a hundred percent dead

263
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,600
so there's pretty much no tolerance for

264
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:22,969
late blight where you can tolerate

265
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,070
septoria and you can tolerate a little

266
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,970
early light there's really no tolerance

267
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,370
for late right and unless you're a

268
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,769
hundred percent vigilant and taking out

269
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,769
and inspecting your plants on a regular

270
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:39,289
basis and removing the one that starts

271
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:41,720
to have late blight most look like it's

272
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:45,409
going it's gonna wipe out your your um

273
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,950
your crop so again resistant varieties

274
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:52,219
there's a list on the Cornell vegetable

275
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:55,540
website in what I've varieties that we

276
00:12:52,220 --> 00:13:00,440
think are late flight resistant

277
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:03,588
using fungicides to keep it at bay but

278
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,810
it certainly is a bad problem that comes

279
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,970
a those each year sometimes it's a

280
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:11,419
really bad late bite season sometimes

281
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,040
it's not so bad so because tomatoes are

282
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:15,588
probably our most important vegetable

283
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,659
crop in the home garden it's important

284
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:20,390
to know each diseases and certainly

285
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:22,069
we'll have workshops all where we really

286
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,689
take a look at this because you you want

287
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,690
to see this up close and personal

288
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:35,300
okay so now let's talk about diseases

289
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,180
where you see the symptoms but not the

290
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:41,929
signs of the disease

291
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:46,549
cold injury a lot of times when people

292
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:50,389
come in and they show me samples like on

293
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:52,759
the the two leftmost pictures like

294
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:54,830
what's hid what disease is hitting my my

295
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,500
plants well it was really it was cold

296
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,590
injury so it's an abiotic disease

297
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,870
nonliving and it's it can be very hard

298
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,240
to diagnose partly because a lot

299
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,940
especially with evergreens the damage

300
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,850
isn't going to show up for a month or

301
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,680
two and so people by the time it's 70

302
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:16,149
degrees you forget how bad the winter

303
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,649
was or maybe not with this year

304
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,939
and they forget that that's that you

305
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,009
know these plants especially the other

306
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,590
green plants that were exposed all

307
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:28,009
winter long can have get this kind of

308
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:32,680
damage and on the right is a picture of

309
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:37,419
a tree Finbar tree probably of maple and

310
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:41,349
they can get cold injury to frost cracks

311
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:44,149
where especially on the south side where

312
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,310
the bark would warm up in this in the

313
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,309
winter and a close but sunny day and

314
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:51,349
then perhaps the Sun goes behind a cloud

315
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,899
and it's back to the very very cold

316
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,230
temperatures and the bark can't expand

317
00:14:53,899 --> 00:15:00,379
and contract that fast and can cause a

318
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:03,250
frost crack so clove injury is something

319
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:07,399
that it's subtle you have to keep a

320
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,679
kind of an eye on the weather and and a

321
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,639
memory in terms of what the cold was

322
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,979
that winter and especially if plants are

323
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,490
susceptible to cold injury when it's not

324
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,649
only cold but it's so frozen that the

325
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,350
plants can't take up water so they they

326
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:27,230
actually desiccate and so you see more

327
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,680
like a drying out damage so that's close

328
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,680
injury

329
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,690
salt damage

330
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,779
on a year especially like the one we've

331
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,330
just had there's a lot of salt on Rhodes

332
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:44,029
and I love this picture on the top right

333
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,460
that's salt spray damage where you can

334
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,819
see they use

335
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,100
got hit directly with salt and the salt

336
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,860
actually desiccates the needles that

337
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,320
salt is saltier than inside the plant

338
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:02,450
and the plant tries to equivalent the

339
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,940
router potential and so what is drawn

340
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,129
out of the needles into the salt at

341
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,040
around that are coating the needles and

342
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:13,250
and kill the plant needle out writing

343
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,829
you can see some bearing on the pine

344
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,980
foliage on the bottom right and then my

345
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,410
my personal favorite salt damage is on

346
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,289
deciduous trees which you wouldn't think

347
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:27,199
would have a problem but under heavy

348
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:30,349
heavy heavy salt spray damage the buds

349
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,930
are killed but especially the terminal

350
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,690
buds they're repeatedly killed by the

351
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:39,019
salt and the plant keeps trying to shoot

352
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,030
shoot out new shoots to accommodate the

353
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:44,179
loss of that terminal twig and you get

354
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:47,769
this what we call witch's broom so in

355
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:50,719
without damage this you can get

356
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:54,049
salt spray damage and you can get

357
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,420
yourself goes into the soil and become

358
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:59,620
makes the roots actually lose water

359
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:02,779
because the roots become less salty than

360
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,549
the soil around it and water is drawn

361
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:08,930
out from the root into the soil

362
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:11,659
there's not a whole lot you can do this

363
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:15,190
for salts for damage if you know you're

364
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:18,980
going to have salt damage to the roots

365
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:21,070
you can leech this excess salt through

366
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,660
the soil profile south is

367
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:26,500
mobile earnest air doesn't get bound up

368
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,670
in the south profile so

369
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,000
usually we don't have to worry about it

370
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,220
too much because

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,690
usually a winter harsh winters followed

372
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,360
by a bunch of spring rains and those

373
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,000
rains flush the salt through the soil

374
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,789
profile but if you if you dumped a bag

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,220
of so I'm sorry dump the back of

376
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:49,009
de-icing salts on one of your favorite

377
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,720
plants by mistake you could obviously

378
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:52,650
try to remove as much salt as possible

379
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,769
and then flush it out on this spring

380
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,990
with water just keep watering that plant

381
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,660
in the early spring and hopefully the

382
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,089
soil salts will move through the soil

383
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,090
profile and away from your higgs

384
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:14,730
brought to 95 blossoms rod is a tomato

385
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:19,309
disease were and sometimes pepper where

386
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:23,299
you get our lesion or sort of that

387
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:26,250
yeah kind of a mushy black lesion on the

388
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,500
one side of the tomato on the end of the

389
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,410
tomato and

390
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:34,380
this is actually a calcium uptake

391
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:36,779
deficiency so in this case where most of

392
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,630
the diseases for tomatoes are worse when

393
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:43,170
it's wet this is a disease when it's

394
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,630
that's worse when it's dry because the

395
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,759
tomato is rapidly expanding that leaves

396
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:52,200
calcium is one of the main ingredients

397
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,839
in cell walls so as the plant is growing

398
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,160
if it doesn't get enough calcium it has

399
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:01,289
problems with the new growth and it

400
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,930
can't especially if it's dry just kick

401
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:06,420
in enough calcium up into the plant and

402
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:09,720
you start getting comes up blossom and

403
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,430
run there are resistant tolerant

404
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,019
varieties so you may want to do that in

405
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:20,220
somewhat rainy New York we don't seem to

406
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:23,089
have it so badly but just be careful if

407
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,589
you we are having a dry

408
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:28,490
summer to make sure your tomatoes are

409
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:30,289
well irrigated so that'll help keep

410
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:33,000
calcium uptake

411
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:35,329
going so you won't have the boss blossom

412
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,329
and rod

413
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,079
finally verticillium wilt verticillium

414
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:47,519
wilt effects some of our most beloved

415
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:51,089
plants it seems to be particularly harsh

416
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,819
on Japanese maples and on red buds but

417
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:56,639
it hits a number of plants certainly

418
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,349
automate those species and you can see

419
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,910
in the upper left-hand corner there's

420
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:03,309
some Japanese maples and they're just

421
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,890
really thinning out looking unthrifty

422
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,710
not very good aesthetically that's

423
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:12,340
probably verticillium wilt and then in

424
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,730
the bottom picture is a maple with some

425
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:18,089
bridge die back and

426
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:20,559
that again is probably verticillium wilt

427
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:22,449
it's a little bit hard to diagnose

428
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,789
sometimes because it's sort of a fading

429
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,789
back but it's early I'm often here to

430
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:30,670
one branch at a time so that can be a

431
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:34,000
clue and if you snip that branch off and

432
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,860
you peel away the bark in the upper

433
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,500
right corner you can see some Browns

434
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,709
streaking in the canyon it just subtle I

435
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,839
found it to be quite subtle

436
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:46,079
but that is

437
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:50,279
diagnostic for verticillium

438
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,990
the brown streaking in the cambium

439
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,930
not much you can do there's really no

440
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:59,440
spray for verticillium it's a sirloin

441
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:01,570
pathogen it's difficult to manage a

442
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,450
couple of things you'd want to do you

443
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:07,089
can remove the affected parts and hope

444
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,890
that you know that contains it I've

445
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:10,389
found that basically you start just

446
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,030
removing the plant on the installment

447
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,710
plant plan or your take off one branch

448
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:16,629
and next year take off another branch

449
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,850
alright next year take off another

450
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,460
branch

451
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:25,119
certainly if that tree dies you would

452
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,309
not want to plant resistant species back

453
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,849
into that site because it's sort of more

454
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,079
in persistence so

455
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:33,369
you wouldn't want to put another mate

456
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,750
though like you wouldn't want to replace

457
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:37,149
the Japanese maple that died of

458
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,039
verticillium with another maple you

459
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,950
might want to put there you know there

460
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,750
are a lot of plants that are resistant

461
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,440
to verticillium so you would want to use

462
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,809
those rather than susceptible diseases

463
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,980
susceptible species

464
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,980
okay well that is the

465
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,259
quick overview of some of the most

466
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,720
common diseases that we see in central

467
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:04,420
new york and

468
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,450
happy disease hunting this has been a
