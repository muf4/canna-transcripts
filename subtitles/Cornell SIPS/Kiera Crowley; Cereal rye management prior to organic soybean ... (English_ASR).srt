00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:11,449
hello everybody for those of you who

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,239
don't know me my name is Kiera Crowley

5
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:16,489
is not just introduced me and I spent

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,579
the last two years working in Matt

7
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:21,739
sustainable copying systems lab and my

8
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:23,869
research has focused on the cereal rye

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,909
as a cover crop and the effects of

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,310
different management strategies on soil

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,859
health weed suppression soybean yield

12
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:32,539
and profitability so I'm going to be

13
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,409
presenting to you some of my results

14
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:38,870
today and I'm it really excited to be up

15
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:41,148
here after these two years and two

16
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:47,049
seasons of field work and finally at

17
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:49,100
this point presenting mistake so um I

18
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:51,858
wanted to before I get started I just

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,780
want to thank a dr. harold venice and

20
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,929
dr. Miguel Gomez on for being on my

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,239
committee as well so i'm going to start

22
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:01,039
just with a brief introduction to my

23
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:05,420
research and then i'm going to focus on

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,920
the results as of 2016 there were three

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,650
hundred and thirty thousand acres of

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,870
soybean planted in new york state that's

27
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,790
two and a half times the acreage in two

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,439
thousand so soybean production is a

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,400
large and growing industry in New York

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,769
State in addition as of 2014 New York

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,750
rake to number three in the country in

32
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,819
terms of number of organic farms so

33
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,730
organic production is also a large and

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:30,409
growing industry in New York State

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,240
however as I'm sure many of you are

36
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,149
aware of there are many challenges with

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,399
organic production and perhaps the main

38
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,560
challenge is with weed suppression so

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,140
typically in organic systems the main

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,659
tool for managing weeds is tillage

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,849
however reliance on village can lead to

42
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,609
problems as we all know it can destroy

43
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,399
soil structure which can lead to erosion

44
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,769
and compaction it's also quite fuel and

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,469
labor intensive so that is presented

46
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:59,479
challenge the third challenge I'd like

47
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,950
to talk about is not only a challenge to

48
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,810
organic production but to all

49
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,240
agricultural production and that's

50
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,829
increased climate variability what

51
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,318
you're seeing in this map is that

52
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,719
between nineteen fifty eight and 2012

53
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,208
the amount of precipitation falling

54
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:17,568
during heavy rainfall events increased

55
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,670
71 percent in the Northeast region so

56
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:22,098
we're seeing more intense storms

57
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:24,949
we're also seeing more drought like we

58
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:26,568
experienced last summer so how are we

59
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,030
going to deal with all of these

60
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:31,039
challenges well one possible solution is

61
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,449
planting cover crops and that's really

62
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,469
what our focus is on and it's exciting

63
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:39,589
solution that a lot of farmers and

64
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:41,599
researchers are interested in it has

65
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,459
potential to improve soil health and

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,219
weed suppression and perhaps even

67
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,469
increase profitability and so my

68
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,840
research is really focused on cereal rye

69
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,519
as a cover crop and assessing the extent

70
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,739
to which it can address some of these

71
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:59,629
challenges so why cereal rye well cereal

72
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,549
rye is a really great cover crop for

73
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:03,949
several reasons one is that it's

74
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,689
feasible for a late fall planting so

75
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,329
that's really important especially in

76
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:09,919
the Northeast we're harvesting is

77
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,870
typically later and you really need to

78
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,109
get a cover crop established and going

79
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,289
before the winter comes cereal rye also

80
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,080
reduces winter soil erosion it produces

81
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:23,329
a large amount of biomass so it is good

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,459
at suppressing weeds and it can also be

83
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,750
used as a forage which we'll talk a

84
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,609
little bit more about so there are three

85
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,560
different management methods of cereal

86
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,709
rye that we were really interested in

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,870
looking at the first is involved

88
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,640
incorporating the cereal rye at jointing

89
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,129
stage and we call this the plow down

90
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,048
treatment then we had a wry llege

91
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,799
treatment where the cereal rye was

92
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:51,379
harvested at boot stage and the stubble

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,819
was incorporated and then finally we

94
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,219
have a plow down treatment where the

95
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,259
cereal rye was roller crimps and laid on

96
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,729
the soil surface to remain there

97
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,340
throughout the season as a weed

98
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:03,018
suppressive mulch and I'll show you a

99
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,549
short clip of a roller crimper in a

100
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,590
second in case you haven't seen one

101
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,930
before but these three treatments were

102
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,319
compared to a no cover crop treatment

103
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,909
and we were especially interested in the

104
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,069
Rye llege and roll down treatments the

105
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,750
Rye llege because of its because of his

106
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,819
growing interest from farmers in

107
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,069
harvesting their cover crops to increase

108
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:24,168
profitability and the roll down because

109
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:26,449
of its ability to suppress weeds and

110
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:31,870
therefore allow no-till during the

111
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:34,089
soybean season in an organic production

112
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,879
so in case some of you haven't seen a

113
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,560
roller crimper this is the roller

114
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,540
crimper rolling down the cereal rye in

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,540
my experiment in 2016

116
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,228
so as you can see this cylinder is

117
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:56,469
literally rolling the ride down and

118
00:04:53,228 --> 00:05:00,668
crimping it to terminate it so that it

119
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,830
will not come back as a weed and it will

120
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:07,448
stay on the soil surface and as a weed

121
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:09,568
suppressive mulch so our hypothesis was

122
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,650
that compared to a no cover crop control

123
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,598
integrating a cereal rye cover crop

124
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:16,209
prior to organic soy bean would improve

125
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:20,620
soil health weed suppression soybean

126
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:22,329
yield and profitability just to give a

127
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,930
brief outline of our materials and

128
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:28,750
methods the experiment was initiated in

129
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,158
2014 and repeated in 2015 it was set up

130
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,978
as a randomized complete block design

131
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:34,509
with four replicates cereal rye was

132
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:36,449
drilled at a hundred and eighty eight

133
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,848
kilograms per hectare in the fall and

134
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,569
the soybean was planted at six hundred

135
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:45,009
and eighteen thousand seeds per hectare

136
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,870
data was analyzed with linear

137
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,090
mixed-effects models so the fixed

138
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,370
effects were treatment year and a

139
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,198
treatment by your interaction and the

140
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,538
random effects were a block and blocked

141
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:00,699
by your interaction and then we compared

142
00:05:55,538 --> 00:06:03,430
the ls means with tukey's hsd so data

143
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:06,400
collection included cover crop biomass

144
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,668
soil sampling Cornell soil health

145
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,810
analyses including soil respiration

146
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:13,209
potentially mineralized will not risen

147
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,000
wet aggregate stability and active

148
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:17,978
carbon water infiltration which we

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,300
measured with Cornell sprinkle

150
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:22,810
infiltrometer zeeeee which I'll show you

151
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,139
in a minute soil moisture soil

152
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,199
temperature weed biomass grain yield and

153
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,329
finally I conducted an economic analysis

154
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,158
where I looked at the variable costs the

155
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,568
labor required and the return over

156
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:40,000
variable costs for each of these

157
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:41,590
treatments so this is the Cornell

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,870
sprinkle infiltrometer for those of you

159
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:46,948
who haven't seen it it was designed by

160
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,228
dr. Hale Venice and Bob Jindal Beck and

161
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,770
it is used to apply a constant rainfall

162
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:55,810
rate to the soil surface and so what we

163
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:58,088
the indicator that we calculate from

164
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,430
that is sorptive ax t which takes into

165
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:02,528
account both the time to run off TR 0

166
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,108
and our the rainfall

167
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:08,408
rate and so you're able to compare how

168
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:11,608
long it takes to run off in each

169
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:11,608
treatment where you do this measurement

170
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:17,649
so before i get into the results i just

171
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,579
wanted to remind you about the weather

172
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:23,889
in the last couple of years this is the

173
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,929
blue line is the 30-year average of

174
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,408
accumulated precipitation between april

175
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:33,488
and october the red line is 2015 and the

176
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:37,209
Green Line is 2016 as you can see 2015

177
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:40,709
15 was an abnormally wet year and 2016

178
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:43,478
was abnormally dry and it's especially

179
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:46,838
important to note this flat line here in

180
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:48,488
June and throughout a lot of July where

181
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:53,249
we were really getting no rain at all

182
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:53,248
and that really did affect our results

183
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:59,738
looking at cereal rye biomass there was

184
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:02,288
no treatment by your interaction here

185
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:03,938
but I did include bars for years within

186
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:05,348
the treatment just because I wanted to

187
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,588
show you that there was a year effects

188
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:11,048
there was more cereal rye biomass in

189
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:13,028
2016 and in 2015 and this is simply

190
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:16,178
because the cereal rye was seated

191
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:18,399
earlier it was seated in September on

192
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:21,338
September 18th in that second year

193
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,288
whereas it was seated on October seventh

194
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:25,899
the year before that so we did have more

195
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:27,759
cereal rye biomass the second year but

196
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,009
what's more important to note here is

197
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,949
the treatment differences so these

198
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,778
letters indicate differences pulled over

199
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:38,049
years so we're seeing that the roll-down

200
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:39,788
had a higher cereal rye biomass than the

201
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,740
other two treatments and this is simply

202
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:43,899
because it was in the ground growing for

203
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,519
longer like two to three weeks longer so

204
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:49,870
there was significantly more biomass

205
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,778
there that was rolled down getting into

206
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,730
some of the soil health results as I

207
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:56,438
said I did several soil health tests

208
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,058
however there were no treatment

209
00:08:56,438 --> 00:09:00,370
differences with wet aggregate stability

210
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:02,649
or active carbon and don't really have

211
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,808
time today to get into the potentially

212
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,999
mineralize obligin results so I'm going

213
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:09,338
to present the soil respiration results

214
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:12,159
and soil respiration is really a measure

215
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,929
of how much co2 is evolved during a

216
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,120
certain time period so it's measuring

217
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,009
microbial activity

218
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,960
and we did see a higher soil respiration

219
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:22,059
in the roll down treatment compared to

220
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,440
the no cover treatment and this can be

221
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,269
explained by the fact that there was

222
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,130
more biomass in that treatment the

223
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,949
cereal rye was growing for a long time

224
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:31,539
the roots were developed and it makes

225
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,310
sense that there'd be more microbial

226
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,929
activity in that treatment than in the

227
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:36,929
no cover where there was no cereal rye

228
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:43,059
looking at syrup tivity just to remind

229
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:45,159
you that this was a indicator that was

230
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:47,559
calculated by using the cornell sprinkle

231
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,899
infiltrometer so we're measuring the

232
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:53,019
time to run off and we are seeing that

233
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,939
in the roll-down treatment on the time

234
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,100
to run off was longer than in the no

235
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,130
cover treatment and again this makes

236
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,259
sense as the water is dripping from the

237
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:04,389
infiltrometer in the roll-down treatment

238
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,389
that cereal rye is absorbing a lot of

239
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:09,639
that water and also slowing down the the

240
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:11,710
water going to the soil surface giving

241
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,860
it more time to infiltrate in addition

242
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:17,139
there's macro pores that the cereal rye

243
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,259
roots have created growing in that soil

244
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,689
so that also facilitates infiltration so

245
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:25,059
it makes sense that there would be a

246
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,080
longer time to run off in the rolled on

247
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:31,809
treatment compared to the no cover

248
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:35,110
moving on to soil moisture this is soil

249
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:37,889
moisture in 2015 in 2015 we started

250
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,860
measuring at the beginning of August and

251
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,899
as you can see so the the stars here are

252
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,060
to signify that the roll-down treatment

253
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,049
had a mean that was significantly

254
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,000
different than the other three

255
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:51,879
treatments so we're seeing that the

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,850
roll-down treatment on these four dates

257
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,289
was had significantly higher soil

258
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,290
moisture than all of the other

259
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:02,319
treatments and this can be explained by

260
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:05,708
the cereal rye slowing down evaporation

261
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,730
and also enhancing water infiltration as

262
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:12,849
we saw with the circ tivity and we saw

263
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,560
this trend again in 2016 this time I

264
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,839
knew what I was doing a little bit

265
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,789
better and started measuring earlier in

266
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,040
the season so I started measuring soil

267
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:24,219
moisture may thirty first when we

268
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,259
planted the soybeans and we saw higher

269
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,519
again higher soil moisture in the rolled

270
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,939
on treatment compared to all the other

271
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,610
treatments on on many of the dates

272
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,889
measured and this has been seen in the

273
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,839
literature it as I said it makes sense

274
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:43,028
float evaporation and improved

275
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:45,370
infiltration looking at soil temperature

276
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:48,278
I'm going to only prevent soil

277
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,679
temperature data from 2016 because again

278
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,720
we only started collecting data in 2015

279
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,929
in August and there were no differences

280
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,360
between treatments but in 2016 we did

281
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,219
see differences between treatments when

282
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,370
we looked at weekly average and maximum

283
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,079
temperatures so as you can see here

284
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,940
again the Stars indicating when the

285
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:08,289
roll-down was had a significantly

286
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,290
different mean compared to the other

287
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:13,599
three treatments and this time a lower

288
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:16,899
mean so you can see that the roll down

289
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,300
on several of the dates had a lower

290
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,919
average and lower maximum weekly

291
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:24,549
temperature compared to the other

292
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:27,360
treatments and this is simply because of

293
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:30,370
the insulated effects of the cereal rye

294
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,389
so it's blocking that solar radiation

295
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,620
and also reflecting it so the lower soil

296
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,740
temperatures have been seen in other

297
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,649
literature and could be a bad thing

298
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,690
earlier in the season when soybeans are

299
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,549
just germinating and starting to grow

300
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,250
but it could also be a good thing later

301
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:50,948
in the season when soybeans in tilled

302
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,570
treatments have higher soil temperature

303
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:55,059
and might be experiencing heat stress

304
00:12:52,570 --> 00:13:00,399
and in this treatment they're really

305
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:03,518
protected from that moving on to weed

306
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,919
biomass we did see higher weed biomass

307
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,959
in the rolled on treatment compared to

308
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,019
the other treatments however it was

309
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:15,369
still relatively low for organic systems

310
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:20,100
it was just 400 kilograms per hectare so

311
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,100
that was very low for an organic system

312
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,600
before i get into the yield data i just

313
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,809
wanted to show you some pictures to

314
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,190
compare um as you can see there aren't

315
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,250
really any noticeable differences

316
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:37,959
between treatments in this year in this

317
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:40,600
2015 however in 2016 there were some no

318
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:42,489
default noticeable differences you can

319
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,540
see the soybeans in the roll-down

320
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,070
treatment

321
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:49,149
we're pretty far behind the other

322
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:53,709
treatments and this was reflected in the

323
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,909
data in 2015 all of the three cereal

324
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,179
right treatments that saw down the

325
00:13:54,909 --> 00:14:00,299
Rileys that roll down performed well

326
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:03,909
compared to the no cover treatment

327
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:08,139
however in 2016 the yield in the rolled

328
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:10,360
on treatment really dropped off it's

329
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,399
important to note though that in 2015

330
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,149
the yield and when the temperate when

331
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,250
the excuse me when the climate was more

332
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,870
normal when there was more rain the

333
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,769
rolled on treatment did perform very

334
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,299
well compared to the no cover treatments

335
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:28,750
so but the drop in yield in the drought

336
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:31,299
year can really be explained by a couple

337
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,539
things one is problems with seed

338
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,250
placement so this is a seed that's on

339
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,860
top of cereal rye that's been pushed

340
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,139
into the row and this has been seen as a

341
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,620
problem enrolled systems but typically

342
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:46,750
in a normal year it's not a big issue

343
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,429
because the seed does get rainwater and

344
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,759
is able to imbibe and send down those

345
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:53,439
roots but in a dry year it doesn't we

346
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,480
didn't get any rain after planting and

347
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:01,560
it wasn't able to imbibe and send down

348
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:04,259
those roots so this did affect yield and

349
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:08,859
finally moving on to the economic

350
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:12,250
analysis I looked at total costs and

351
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,649
total labor by looking at all of the

352
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,600
field operations that occurred in each

353
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:20,470
treatment so these are all of the field

354
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,778
operations in 2014 and 2015 they're

355
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,670
similar to the field operations occurred

356
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:27,789
in the second year the only difference

357
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:29,828
is this year we had I mean in 2015 there

358
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:33,730
were five intero cultivation events

359
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:35,469
whereas in 2016 with the dry weather

360
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,089
there weren't as many weeds so not as

361
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,120
much need to cultivate so there were

362
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:42,459
fewer cultivation events on but in order

363
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,470
to calculate the total cost we took the

364
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,958
custom rates for all of these operations

365
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:50,439
and then we also added the cost of the

366
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:53,078
cereal rye seed and the soybean seed to

367
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:55,809
calculate the total variable costs and

368
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:58,138
as you can see the no cover treatment

369
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:01,419
had the the lowest

370
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,820
and that's because there was no cereal

371
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:07,088
rye being drilled in that treatment so

372
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,430
they avoided that expense on the

373
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:13,709
roll-down treatment is also a pretty low

374
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:16,208
cost so that's showing that the lack of

375
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,888
cultivation that's money saved from not

376
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,919
cultivating in that treatment with

377
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:24,759
almost enough to compensate for that for

378
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:28,870
the cereal rye and then looking at the

379
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,789
labor this is really really interesting

380
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,240
is the low labor in the roll-down

381
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:36,429
treatment and that is because again of

382
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,528
the lack of cultivation and so you're

383
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,439
saving a lot of labour time in that

384
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:44,980
treatment by not doing that cultivation

385
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,279
so not only compared to the no cover is

386
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,320
it lower labor but also compared to the

387
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:53,559
plow down which might be a more typical

388
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:59,829
way of managing cereal rye in organic

389
00:16:53,559 --> 00:17:03,068
systems it is much lower labor moving on

390
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:05,980
to the return over variable costs the

391
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:08,470
rye llege performed very well although

392
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,308
it had higher cost as we saw in the past

393
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:15,130
slide mainly because of the harvesting

394
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:18,338
and baling expenses on you're getting a

395
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,740
lot of added income from that rye llege

396
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:23,740
sol it did have higher profitability

397
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,599
than the other two cereal right

398
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,490
treatments in both years and even higher

399
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,959
profitability than the no cover

400
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:35,558
treatment in 2015 and then in in the

401
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,720
roll-down treatment in 2015 we saw that

402
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,609
the profitability was comparable to the

403
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,548
no cover and the roll down and the plow

404
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:44,829
down however in 2016 the profitability

405
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:51,879
dropped and again that was because of

406
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:53,589
the yield drop so in conclusion compared

407
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,270
to the no cover treatment there was

408
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:58,209
greater soil respiration in the roll

409
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:00,548
down treatment there was greater

410
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,529
infiltration and soil moisture in the

411
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:05,889
rolled on treatment compared to the

412
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,178
other treatments weed biomass with

413
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,860
greater in the roll down treatment but

414
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:14,630
again very reasonable for an organic

415
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:16,639
really very pretty low the yield was

416
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,080
very low in the roll down treatment in

417
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,299
the drought year in 2016 however it's

418
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,730
important to note that it was also very

419
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:30,190
good in 2015 when we had more rain and

420
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,660
that's more of a typical year for us so

421
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,220
so it was important to learn that it

422
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,860
doesn't do well in drought but it also

423
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:41,210
does well in it does do well when there

424
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:42,589
is more moisture more rain the costs

425
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,440
were lowest in the no cover treatment

426
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:48,019
but the labor requirement was lowest in

427
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,120
the roll down treatment and finally

428
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:51,740
profitability with greater in the Rileys

429
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:55,189
treatment than other cereal right

430
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,720
treatments in both of the years so

431
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:02,000
overall in summary there is no one

432
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,890
cereal rye management method that gives

433
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,679
you all of the benefits the soil health

434
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:10,520
the weed suppression the soybean yield

435
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:13,669
the profitability on certain ones give

436
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,319
you a smattering of benefits you see the

437
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,570
Rileys you're getting increased

438
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,359
profitability with the roll-down you're

439
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:23,720
getting some increases in soil health

440
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:28,069
and also reduction in labor which is

441
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,069
very important and you are as I said

442
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:33,109
also having comparable yields and

443
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,500
comparable profitability in that rolled

444
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:37,969
on treatment in a good year and so the

445
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,369
rolled on treatment is really getting

446
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:44,539
pretty close to hitting a lot of those

447
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:47,829
benefits but good to note that it

448
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:47,829
doesn't work so well in a drought year

449
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,450
finally I would like to thank all

450
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:55,159
everybody that helps me in this um I was

451
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,660
really worried I was going to forget

452
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,429
somebody and I think I did well so um

453
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,070
the Cornell nutrient analysis lab

454
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:07,580
Tatiana and Alejandro and Shelley thank

455
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:10,548
you all for your help and I'd also like

456
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,619
to thank the USD orgy program for

457
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:15,589
funding this research the sustainable

458
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:18,500
cropping systems lab all of our present

459
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,939
and past members all of the research

460
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,019
assistants that helped with the field

461
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,670
work

462
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:27,109
and finally the Cornell soil health lab

463
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,900
for helping me with all those analyses

464
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:32,089
and then Paul Zukowski out at musgrave

465
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,430
research farm and all of his team for

466
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:43,549
helping with the field work thank you

467
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:44,900
and I think any questions I think will

468
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,839
eliminate the questions you I just

469
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:57,350
wanted okay yes Chuck I was wondering

470
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:59,689
about the weed biomass yeah that was an

471
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:03,309
average over the two years because there

472
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,309
was no treatment by your interaction

473
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,819
there was more weed biomass in the first

474
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:19,149
year because there was more more

475
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:19,149
moisture but it wasn't significant yes

476
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:26,570
and fighters go ahead and write is there

477
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:31,909
any way to them over that ordeal that a

478
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:34,629
Republican that situation with all the

479
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:41,509
investors yeah language

480
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:45,920
yeah I don't know about a mechanical way

481
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:49,129
I think that irrigation could work we

482
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,390
tried irrigating but we didn't have the

483
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,240
resources we weren't really set up to

484
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:56,900
irrigate so we were only able to add

485
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,370
like a quarter inch of rain but if you

486
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,580
were really set up for that than that

487
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:07,339
might that would help for sure I don't

488
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:10,849
know about a mechanical way did you have

489
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:18,019
a good word should we I guess so much to

490
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:29,029
require in the critical thing like yes

491
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:37,519
Yeah Yeah right yeah yeah I agree all

492
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:40,549
right okay okay this has been a

493
