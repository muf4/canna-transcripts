1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,919
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,480
University one of the great parts of

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,120
this gig here at Cornell is going in and

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,679
out of the city every once in a while

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,798
New York City is a fascinating place

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,759
where grass meets people and I got a

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,278
chance to walk on as the moodlight was

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,240
out the old Lincoln Center roof that I

9
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,439
worked on many years ago back in 2009

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,000
when they built this roof and put the

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,079
grass on it um a number of years ago it

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,439
was just a beautiful night and wandered

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,679
around Central Park with Zack Holmes on

14
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,558
Tuesday uh very interesting uh Landscape

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,359
Management there of which sports turf is

16
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,359
involved and you know Carl we can't

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,479
start out without something ridiculous

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,640
right who knows what happened you hope

19
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,078
nobody was hurt this guy looks like he

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,439
went off a off the road or off a

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,079
embankment or hit the wrong button and

22
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,198
the guy says maybe didn't like our pin

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,120
placements that day so you never know

24
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:55,960
what these kinds of things you know car

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,878
we've been talking a lot about putting

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,000
animals to work this has been a common

27
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:01,718
Trend this guy doesn't look so happy

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
Happ about it this time maybe he didn't

29
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,680
get a good night's sleep or whatever but

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,079
he's not thrilled about having to work

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,840
and then a big uh Melancholy shout out

32
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,359
to Tom Kaplan the current president of

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,799
nista just had to put his dog down this

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,200
is a big thing uh in our industry with

35
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,880
the connection between dogs and our work

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,799
life and our personal life and our

37
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,759
emotional well-being and when these

38
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,640
things happen it's always good to share

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,280
it with each other as a person who

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,439
didn't grow up with a dog but then had a

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,159
dog I sort of realized man this thing

42
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,438
hits pretty hard when it does and just

43
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,560
in case anybody was wondering whether I

44
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,078
won the pie in the face contest thanks

45
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,118
to everybody who contributed uh to this

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,639
Ridiculousness we raised uh $600 for the

47
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,920
farm neck group here at Cornell uh and

48
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,079
as a member of the a science faculty

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,719
here uh I was happy to do it with my

50
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,718
colleague Mike Amber Mike Van Amberg in

51
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,199
Dairy science all right Carl I'm gonna

52
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:55,759
do the weather quick we're gonna do the

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,759
rant and then we're going to get right

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,519
into a little bit of me to set up our

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,640
conversation with Trent uh with chent

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,319
with Trent with Chase sorry uh soils are

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
still pretty cool I gotta say uh you

58
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,840
know things are growing for sure but

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,319
when you look at our soil temperature

60
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,400
data you know just from a few days ago

61
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,159
you can see we're still in the upper 40s

62
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,120
mid-50s uh the 60s have moved down only

63
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,199
into the delm Marva Peninsula really and

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,599
last week of course was cooler than

65
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,958
normal right when you look at the

66
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:28,238
departure uh you see it very cool along

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
the coast but the big story this uh

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,840
spring has been the rain and I don't

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,039
know what's going on in in in the South

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,598
Chase but we are we are sort of

71
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:39,759
saturated we are half saturated here and

72
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,079
you know as we get the conversation this

73
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,479
has to be an element of a conversation

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,760
with the kind of field you choose to use

75
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,560
no matter what web of decision making

76
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,120
you have to uh navigate or map of

77
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,280
decision making you have to navigate uh

78
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,920
when it comes to uh climate change and I

79
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,360
know it's mentioned in your proposal

80
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,359
that we'll talk about later uh but but

81
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,920
this is of course something to consider

82
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,239
because you're In the Heat of the spring

83
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,039
Sports season now right up here where we

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,640
are we're in the heat of the spring

85
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,759
Sports season now the other thing is you

86
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,878
know we don't go crazy about this but

87
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,840
you know we're a few weeks behind last

88
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,518
year uh maybe only a week or so behind

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,039
normal but this is going to change

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,239
pretty quick and we'll talk about this

91
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,639
in a minute if you look at Carl's growth

92
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,878
model that he's built here on the

93
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,958
forecast website Carl I got to remember

94
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,039
to put the QR code up there so people

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,560
can see this but if you are listening on

96
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,759
the podcast the forecast website really

97
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,560
has this wonderful growth model that

98
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,199
picked up the little bit of blip and

99
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,280
growth we got last week and we saw it

100
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,438
really in the in the research plots as

101
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,318
well nice blip of growth but you see

102
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:47,239
that's returned to very slow growth and

103
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:50,199
it looks like forecasts for the next few

104
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,959
days are going to be slow as well now as

105
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,919
we heard this morning on our weekly

106
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,680
conference call uh it looks like it's

107
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,359
going to be warm and dry for a couple of

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,560
weeks this is a very interesting pattern

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,239
uh we went into a prolonged dry period

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
art wasn't willing to put his neck on

111
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,599
the line uh for going longer than 8 to

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,599
10 days but certainly a a a period where

113
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,959
you we're going to get some dry weather

114
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,518
now the other part I can't leave you

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,360
without uh thinking about our risk

116
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,358
assessment tool on the forecast website

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
uh it looks like as you get South the

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,799
red risk is growing and if you look

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,080
carefully at our weed control where we

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,400
recommend the 24d applications in the

121
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,399
spring based on degree day models you

122
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,319
can see it's also moving into that same

123
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,038
area

124
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,759
so this is exactly what we're talking

125
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,439
about and Carl you raised a really good

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,319
point uh uh over the week when we were

127
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,759
chatting about this you know you see

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,519
what happens when you get obsessed with

129
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,160
grass every place you walk and go you

130
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,560
see these things everywhere you take a

131
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,720
picture the people just finished mowing

132
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,839
uh this lawn by our botanic garden

133
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,120
probably at three and a half inches and

134
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,038
it still remains uh filled with flowers

135
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,918
now that's not really the topic of today

136
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,800
nor is this Ridiculousness at Real

137
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,399
Madrid stadium Chase I don't know if

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,600
you've had a chance to see this

139
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,519
craziness but this is some other level

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,120
hydraulic meeting of uh controlled

141
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:12,198
environment agriculture vertical

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,879
agriculture uh with sports turf of all

143
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,840
things and Carl as we uh sort of get to

144
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,120
you your rant that's the setup for today

145
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,959
uh we hear a lot about these surfaces

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,120
look at the lengths we go to to give

147
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,120
them a natural grass surface Carl what

148
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,759
else is involved here yeah right so we

149
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,360
we're always talking about field safety

150
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,199
right Frank and and how we can manage

151
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,120
the fields specifically to meet these

152
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,600
certain thresholds or or uh benchmarks

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,478
whether it's traction or firmness or

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,560
ball roll or ball bounce however you

155
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:45,000
choose to measure it uh but ultimately

156
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,319
the athlete is still interacting with

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,038
the surface with some sort of Footwear

158
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,759
on their foot right and and we talked

159
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,240
about this a bit with Andy mcnet in past

160
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,240
episodes but that selection of Footwear

161
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,879
is really important and how it pertains

162
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,079
to their performance and their safety on

163
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,120
the field uh so you can just it doesn't

164
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,680
take very long to figure out that people

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
have been trying to optimize Footwear

166
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,959
for athletes for a long time uh you look

167
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,680
at some of the research in running where

168
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,038
the the how the collar fits on your

169
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,720
ankle changes your gate and how you

170
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,719
decelerate and turn uh the midsole

171
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,960
thickness apparently is a big factor and

172
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,919
how thick that sort of s shoe sole is

173
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,519
influences how the energy transfers up

174
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:25,399
your leg while you're running so it can

175
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,478
have an injury risk it can also have uh

176
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,598
a performance aspect and then they also

177
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,560
look at hey when you're running on

178
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,399
concrete versus a rubber track you

179
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,160
should pick shoes that have different

180
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,359
sort of sole depths right if if you're

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,120
on a unforgiving Surface like concrete

182
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,720
you need a larger depth because you

183
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,800
don't want all that energy going back up

184
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,639
into your knee and your hip and and

185
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,560
elevating your injury risk so right

186
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,598
shoes matter for performance and for

187
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,038
safety Andy mcnet has looked at this a

188
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,879
bunch and we've talked about the the

189
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,240
sort of traction elements of Footwear

190
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,120
and he's looked at um you know studies

191
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,879
with this and now they have their

192
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,598
traction database basically saying hey

193
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,759
when you select a footwear that has a

194
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,079
certain traction sort of component it's

195
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,639
going to affect your injury risk

196
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,800
especially based on the field so they've

197
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,918
got this traction ba database at the

198
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,720
Penn State website Bermuda grass

199
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,598
Kentucky Bluegrass field Turf and they

200
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,840
will give you the traction values of

201
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,680
specific Footwear types and what they

202
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,239
say is hey the highest traction value

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
may be good for performance you can

204
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,639
stick your foot in the ground and and

205
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,000
change direction really quickly but that

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,800
also increases your injury risk right if

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,399
that shoe's not going to give something

208
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,120
in that system is going to give and it's

209
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,079
probably your ankle or or your knee

210
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,840
right if you're an athlete who can

211
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,000
generate a lot of force but can't then

212
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,519
move uh you don't want to select a

213
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,720
really high traction shoe so you got to

214
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,680
find something in the middle that

215
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,960
matches also the traction of the

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,360
surfaces you're playing on right so

217
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,399
there's the interaction between the

218
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,038
Surface and the Footwear we also know

219
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,478
people are different too right Frank and

220
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,120
and we've done a little bit of research

221
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,478
with uh Footwear and putting surfaces

222
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,918
and we find that different people cause

223
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,318
different amounts of disruption to

224
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,799
putting surfaces right you could see

225
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,919
here if you're watching uh subject a

226
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,680
creates a lot more visual disruption to

227
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,560
the putting surface than subject B

228
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,800
because they walk a little bit

229
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,038
differently right and how they apply

230
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Force into the ground is different so

231
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,360
all this would say hey if I'm a

232
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
professional athlete uh and I want to

233
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,439
maximize performance but I also want to

234
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,079
minimize my injury risk I should

235
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,680
probably have a really sort of in-depth

236
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,839
detailed way to choose my shoes on Game

237
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,759
Day right at at the NFL level these are

238
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,878
organizations valued I don't know five

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,360
to 10 billion dollars surely there is

240
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,000
someone on staff who can select Footwear

241
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,400
based on the game day field and the

242
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,120
athletes that are in that field but uh I

243
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,879
saw this video a couple months ago this

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,918
is from Hard Knock a documentary series

245
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,320
uh they followed the the Miami Dolphins

246
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,478
last year and before the playoff game in

247
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,560
Kansas City here's our running backs

248
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,879
coach and in the video he's talking to

249
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,199
the running backs in the room he says

250
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,080
hey guys it's going to look like a green

251
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,879
field but it's painted dirt okay it's

252
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,320
painted dirt that's what it is so make

253
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,600
sure you take a couple pairs of shoes

254
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,920
there's there's two things that I don't

255
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,159
like about this FR one this is Arrowhead

256
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,000
Stadium Travis Hogan generally regarded

257
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,120
as the gold standard of of sports turf

258
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,720
managers right I think everybody in the

259
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,879
industry that that uh field that staff

260
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,560
is is sort of the level that we all

261
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,720
aspire to so that's that's one thing

262
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,919
calling this uh just painted grass or

263
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,680
painted dirt the second thing is he's

264
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,719
leaving this decision about what

265
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,559
footwear to choose up to the athletes

266
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,440
and they will always choose the highest

267
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,559
traction shoe because it maximizes

268
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,760
performance they shouldn't have to go

269
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,559
through a bunch of literature and figure

270
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,240
out okay which one's the best for injury

271
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,559
risk though and how should I measure the

272
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,919
field before there should be somebody on

273
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,278
staff who's making that decision uh

274
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,879
during the games and maybe there is and

275
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,838
maybe this quote is taken out of context

276
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,360
but man it feels like this is a coach

277
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,600
just saying hey guys you got some shoes

278
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,360
at home bring a couple run around a

279
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
little bit and and you'll figure it out

280
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,240
and and that man that does not seem like

281
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,439
a wise thing uh when you've got that

282
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,320
amount of stakes that amount of

283
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,800
competition that amount of money

284
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,120
involved uh in in sports yeah so and and

285
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,599
so there's the rant right the rant is

286
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,679
this should be safety equipment not

287
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,278
something a running back's coach is

288
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,799
advising unless he's got a brief uh to

289
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,399
to address this particular issue because

290
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,199
I think it's funny right when you think

291
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,480
about that Carl how little it appears

292
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,320
and of course we could be taking this

293
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,519
out of context it appears not much

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,399
thought seems to be given even though

295
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,159
I've heard from John sarakin and Andy

296
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,799
that they they put signs in the locker

297
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,000
rooms uh at these things about the kinds

298
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,559
of Footwear that they recommending

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,399
things now it seems odd to me when data

300
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,159
is such a part of the game right the

301
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,440
analytics of like just a soccer game uh

302
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,399
where on the field the action is taking

303
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
uh Chase has looked into this over the

304
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,159
years but there's also the strategy of

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,440
the way you want to play and where uh

306
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,480
the traffic winds up uh being

307
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,560
concentrated now chase this is

308
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
interesting right because you did a lot

309
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,799
of work in this area this is where I

310
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,278
want to start with we SED set up i s of

311
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,919
saw what Carl was going to do I like oh

312
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:08,320
this is a perfect setup for for for our

313
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,759
pal Chase okay the Footwear might be a

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,720
hidden risk we don't think about but

315
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,639
you've identified there's a lot of

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,160
variability in the field and in your

317
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,560
real great work right you basically said

318
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,199
listen there's a lot of things that vary

319
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,359
but the important stuff like soil

320
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,879
moisture and hardness don't really vary

321
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,399
much over the course of a tournament or

322
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,879
when you want something to perform it

323
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,759
depends on how what it is going in or

324
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,320
the existing variability in the field so

325
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,600
no matter how it happens there's going

326
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,000
to be some out there over a period of

327
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,920
Time how when if you had to reconcile

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,958
Footwear and

329
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,879
inconsistencies let's start at the

330
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,278
highest level where they strive to make

331
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,879
them uniform do you think those

332
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,720
inconsistencies are perceptible by the

333
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:59,360
athlete or in some ways also

334
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,240
contributing to the equation

335
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,839
yeah well thanks thanks for having me on

336
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,440
guys appreciate it always fun um yeah I

337
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
haven't seen these this figure in a long

338
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,560
time

339
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,838
yeah yeah this is some of my early work

340
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
you know you know it it depends Frank I

341
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,600
think when we talk professional sports

342
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,399
it's so different now with the lay

343
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,000
andplay side and how much they're

344
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,240
they're renovating the field so

345
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,440
frequently I don't know the degree of

346
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,278
within field variability at that level

347
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,320
you know but when you're talking about

348
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,879
some of the the the community level

349
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
fields that that I work on I mean even

350
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,679
Collegiate level Fields they're not

351
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,480
renovating as frequently as the

352
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,919
professionals I do think there's a

353
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,440
degree of of within field variability I

354
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,278
think as long as you have a 100% grass

355
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,680
cover that probably doesn't get into the

356
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,559
athletes head but if you're on a you

357
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,799
know High School level natural grass

358
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,518
natural soil native soil field um yeah

359
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,919
if the we've done research we've

360
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,759
interviewed athletes they recognize when

361
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,838
there's no grass cover or thin grass

362
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,759
cover and they actually do adjust the

363
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,519
way they behave and I would assume that

364
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,198
their Footwear and footing would would

365
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,440
do that too we haven't looked at that

366
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:08,799
specifically um but I would assume that

367
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,800
that it would interact differently all

368
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,719
right good okay sorry to be a blast from

369
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,759
the past but this no you're good yeah

370
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,959
yeah but but that variability that you

371
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,278
identified is exactly what we wanted to

372
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,559
say is at the highest level maybe this

373
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,360
isn't an issue and those guys really

374
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,838
need to think about Footwear because

375
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
every you know the fields are as good as

376
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,440
we can get them uh at that level one

377
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,039
would hope but this is a pretty good

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
example of what an average Community

379
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,360
Field will look like in in August uh

380
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,359
when the players get back and you've got

381
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,839
crab grass filling in there going to be

382
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,159
going a flower soon now over the years

383
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,399
Chase we've sort of tried to address

384
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,159
this on our sports turf website we have

385
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,559
this very simple tool that I've used

386
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,480
with school boards a couple of times and

387
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,719
gone around with the ground staff and

388
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,159
talked about sort of how would you rate

389
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
this have the guy ask a question make

390
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,439
sure they understood what the grounds

391
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,199
man new you know start to create this

392
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,199
community Dynamic and then Carl passes

393
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,799
along this and I know he passed it on to

394
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:11,359
you I want to start sort of with like

395
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,479
the gold standard we we're not entirely

396
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,480
sure who did this work So eventually

397
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,800
we'll just put it out there and see

398
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,839
where all this came from but a a School

399
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,278
District in California Fremont

400
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,399
California it looks like uh presented

401
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,480
something back in 2020 in the fall uh

402
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,720
about a Synthetic Turf versus natural

403
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,000
grass this is an incredibly elaborate

404
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,920
presentation of which the only thing

405
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,879
that immediately jumped out worthy of

406
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,078
our discussion here is not all traffic

407
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,159
is the same we don't really know how to

408
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,439
quantify it that's what this graph is

409
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,519
saying but an hour of baseball is

410
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,639
different than an hour of field hockey

411
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,519
an hour of softball is different than an

412
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,360
hour of rugby right when it comes to the

413
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,919
amount of wear and tear uh the fields

414
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,199
should be able to or you know are going

415
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,319
to have to handle and Carl we think

416
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,359
about this like with rounds of golf too

417
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,320
a much easier measure uh in some ways to

418
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,440
determine especially with nikolai's work

419
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
years ago that we're going to validate

420
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,360
this Summer that the majority of the

421
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,278
steps on a putting green happen right

422
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,399
around the the whole location so we know

423
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,120
not all traffic is the same and so you

424
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,039
have all these variables Chase here's

425
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,639
this great title of the proposal uh that

426
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,519
you're doing and in the background is

427
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,680
Joe Magle oa's uh field down in Elmyra

428
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,959
City School District uh exactly the

429
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,039
kinds of fields that you and I sort of

430
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,599
have to we work with all the time we

431
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,599
don't work at the highest levels where

432
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,240
they have where money's not an object

433
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
but it's not just about the money right

434
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
when you look at this proposal and I'm

435
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,839
putting this up here so everybody else

436
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:50,679
can glaze over at the amount of uh a

437
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,199
logic that's going into trying to

438
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:57,198
determine how to solve field problems

439
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:59,519
help communities answer the question is

440
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,519
natural turf or Synthetic Turf

441
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,480
a better option and in the meantime

442
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,240
navigate the web of communication this I

443
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,480
think Chase really depicts uh the

444
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,079
project here so let's let's start right

445
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,839
here with the conversation right we

446
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:18,000
think about Footwear we think about uh

447
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,120
field quality you've already passed the

448
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,198
comment just give me full Gras cover and

449
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,639
we when we three talk and the people

450
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:29,399
that might be listening think okay well

451
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,480
how hard is that that doesn't seem hard

452
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,120
you know Ben Palmer puts him on sneakers

453
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,560
in the spring right to not put as much

454
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,399
wear and tear okay uh so how why is this

455
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,879
so hard because Carl and I also know how

456
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,159
hard this is but talk a little bit about

457
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,958
navigating something that seems simple

458
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,639
like just get really good grass cover

459
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,518
and should be able to hold up to a

460
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,079
certain amount of wear and tear and

461
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,839
getting that executed on many of the

462
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:01,359
communities uh throughout the

463
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,680
country that's a loaded question get it

464
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,880
buddy that's that's why we paid a big

465
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:10,038
bucks to be here brother I I mean it it

466
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,400
all boils down to to funding and I and

467
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,519
that's going to be related to having

468
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,759
some professional sports field Turf

469
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,720
sports turf manager um to to hire

470
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,798
somebody who's knowledgeable and how to

471
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,558
do that is that the first step is that

472
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:29,599
is that it if you had to boil it down to

473
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:32,519
the key to making this happen is it

474
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,199
making sure they can attract somebody

475
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,400
who knows like they do what they're

476
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:42,720
doing just like they do for HVAC systems

477
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,759
and other systems in facility operations

478
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,160
how come we can't get it viewed as a

479
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:52,440
trade like that if that's the key is it

480
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,759
the key and how come yeah I think so and

481
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,919
it's because you have somebody

482
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,919
knowledgeable on how to and this is true

483
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,880
for Synthetic Turf maintenance too you

484
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
have somebody knowledge knowable on what

485
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,880
it takes to properly maintain the field

486
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,158
rather than somebody who doesn't and so

487
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
they're going to be the one who's

488
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,760
getting educated hopefully attending

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,880
things like this okay keeping up with

490
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,599
the industry and they're gonna they're

491
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,640
going to be the resource on okay how do

492
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,319
we provide the safe playable fields and

493
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,200
that's for all field okay so so um as I

494
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,759
said you know the weather's not so good

495
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,840
and we got a lot of kids want to play

496
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,440
sports and we got a lot of native soil

497
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:32,839
Fields uh up this neck of the woods um

498
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,400
I would say the uh uh frequency of

499
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:38,399
questions we're getting in New York

500
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,919
outside of New York nationally from

501
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,240
concerned people not necessarily people

502
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,280
in the management business that when we

503
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,159
deal with regularly but a different

504
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,879
level of sort of advocacy that um

505
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,159
they're against Synthetic Turf they've

506
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,080
sort of turned on Synthetic Turf now the

507
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,240
the preponderance some Synthetic Turf

508
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:02,038
system so when you try to navigate this

509
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,640
thing in your mind as you see this grant

510
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,240
unfolding what do you think are the keys

511
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,240
that you're going to develop in this

512
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,120
grant that are going to be important for

513
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,440
forming that decision that even if

514
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,839
somebody wanted to think about it now

515
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,840
what are some of the things that are

516
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,839
going to come out of this work and you

517
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,678
think people should be considering that

518
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,158
are keys in that discussion at the

519
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,120
community

520
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,960
level well I think one thing is you know

521
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,519
we're we're turf grass scientists right

522
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,319
the three of us um but at the same time

523
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:33,000
we're researchers and our job is to

524
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:36,000
provide un unbiased data to stakeholders

525
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,960
to benefit their job and so from with

526
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,679
that perspective we have to do a fair

527
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,200
assessment on natural grass versus

528
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,559
Synthetic Turf in all aspects of what

529
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,159
we're evaluating in that study and you

530
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,839
know so our initial submission was last

531
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,080
year and that was a knock on it as we

532
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,879
were to prograss and when I first got

533
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,240
that comment from a reviewer that we

534
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,799
need to be more unbiased I was like

535
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,640
really this is USDA yada yada and I was

536
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,599
kind of upset about it but after sitting

537
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,120
on it for a year and having to reformat

538
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,038
this this proposal you know I I get now

539
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,519
why they want that um they can't invest

540
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,279
a lot of money when our initial we have

541
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,400
an initial bias already uh that we want

542
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,720
to that grass is going to be the best we

543
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,080
it was obvious the way that we first

544
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,919
read it written it so we we we

545
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,798
reformatted it we've pulled in Industry

546
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,640
people from all from every side and we

547
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,119
we're truly coming at it from a more

548
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
unbiased approach and that's going to

549
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,038
benefit every body because we're going

550
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,000
to have we're going to have factual

551
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,798
information none of these numbers are

552
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,960
going to be leaning one way or the other

553
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,359
they are what they are right and we have

554
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,240
we have people now on board that's going

555
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,519
to help us balance that so I think that

556
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,919
that's that was top priority with the

557
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,200
resubmission um now within that I mean

558
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,559
all the factors that we're trying to

559
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,360
consider in the study I mean we're

560
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:56,480
looking at environmental factors uh

561
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:59,079
safety uh costs obviously and one field

562
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,640
type will probably be beneficial in one

563
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,879
scenario and another field type will be

564
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,120
beneficial in another so it's not going

565
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,720
to be so cut and dry um but nonetheless

566
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,079
we need to provide unbiased information

567
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,400
so that people can make the decisions

568
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,759
that's best for themselves I mean when

569
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,840
you talk about professional level Fields

570
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,839
um you know they they're a completely

571
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,918
different world than Community level

572
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:24,079
fields and all the the variability in

573
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:27,278
community level Fields is so extreme so

574
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,558
just to be able to provide large scale

575
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:31,839
unbiased information about all field

576
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,558
types covering all components of

577
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,399
community Level Sports Fields is our

578
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,399
goal so that they can make the decisions

579
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,240
for themselves it's not natural grass

580
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
versus Synthetic Turf it's just they

581
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,200
have they have the information they need

582
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,600
that's exactly right so so and here is

583
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,440
you know what a extension scientist who

584
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,759
doesn't do too much research in this

585
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,080
area generally tells people especially

586
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,679
with a spring like this with the amount

587
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,158
of kids that want to play you got two

588
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,559
options if you have natural grass and

589
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:03,120
you got you know 200 % normal rainfall

590
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,000
uh you better have a lot of extra Fields

591
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,558
where you're going to have to sacrifice

592
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,759
and move them around to a certain extent

593
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,519
even if they're built out of sand right

594
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:16,319
if if you don't rotate them or relign

595
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,759
them or move them around if you get this

596
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,158
kind of weather you're going to see

597
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,919
significant damage right so this is

598
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,440
where I'd say this is a time where

599
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,080
access to some Synthetic Turf is really

600
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,720
valuable in the summertime I'd say I

601
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,319
don't want the those kids on that Turf

602
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,679
that Turf even up here in Upstate New

603
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,240
York's going to get really hot never

604
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,480
mind what it's going to be down there in

605
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,720
Texas I mean there's some very simple

606
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,640
things involved here but what I I don't

607
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,120
know Carl what do you think too because

608
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,559
you've also interacted with these people

609
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,359
my sense is you get a lot of project

610
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,879
management people involved in these

611
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,000
communities as well and I was trying to

612
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,039
think you you know you got this web of

613
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,240
stakeholders and there's always going to

614
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:59,200
be somebody driving the bus and who's

615
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,159
sort of putting down the initi stuff and

616
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,278
I think they're very project management

617
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,320
engineering oriented like you Carl and I

618
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:08,038
think they're like how much can I use it

619
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,558
and how much does it cost me to maintain

620
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,720
it know I want to use it I want to Main

621
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,879
and these other things are more like

622
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,400
okay well like we'll figure that out

623
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,880
because everything else has to be

624
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,559
somewhere between that right Carl so do

625
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,559
is that what it boils down to in the

626
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:27,359
conversations you started to have with

627
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,879
folks there might be a bit of that but I

628
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,479
think the Nuance as long some people

629
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,960
like Frank you just explained synthetic

630
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,919
is great for the spring it's not great

631
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,798
for the summer and and that's sort of an

632
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,080
if then thing that that's not a zero or

633
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,440
one like okay we either need synthetic

634
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:44,599
or we need natural and that's where I

635
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,798
think just a little bit we poked around

636
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,519
with with sort of K through 12

637
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:49,599
facilities they want to make a decision

638
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,319
and then that's it like that's the the

639
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,599
last we have to think about fields we

640
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,839
can focus on the building and Pest

641
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,038
Control in the building and education of

642
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,038
our students and like Chase is saying

643
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,119
really you need somebody there who's a

644
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,079
professional and knows the day-to-day

645
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,719
and the week to week and the

646
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,000
month-to-month activities that will vary

647
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,880
based on the season or based on the use

648
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,400
um and and one thing we got from Chase's

649
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,520
proposal when you shared with us last

650
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,240
year Chase was like whoa we don't

651
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,200
understand who's making decisions at

652
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,519
Community levels like is it just a coach

653
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,919
who coaches football and it's just like

654
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,359
yeah I'll mow the fields and then I'll

655
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,919
make all the you know like baseball

656
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,079
fields I didn't realize a lot of the

657
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,880
baseball coaches end up mowing those

658
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,038
sort of high school level middle level

659
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,559
Fields they're making decisions they're

660
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,960
just a baseball coach and probably have

661
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,599
another full-time job right so we don't

662
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,000
even understand who's making decisions

663
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,119
and that's why it's really important to

664
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,798
get this work done Chase is like we know

665
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,918
the turf stuff that you should do it

666
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,679
should be easy but all those other

667
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,240
factors if it's parents if it's

668
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,640
administrators if it's facility people

669
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,558
who are really focused on HVAC or power

670
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,000
generators getting generators or

671
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,879
something like that and they're just

672
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,919
mowing the fields right like that's the

673
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,919
sort of but

674
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,399
but this is why but this is why they go

675
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,480
to Synthetic Turf right Chason you said

676
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,239
it the assumption is it's no maintenance

677
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,120
for Synthetic Turf that I can build it

678
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,919
and forget it it's Capital money it's

679
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:15,319
not annual operating dollars I signed a

680
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,360
warranty the company's going to come for

681
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:20,398
six years and make sure it's cared for

682
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,599
right and so you know it gets at least a

683
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,678
little bit of that but I I think the

684
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,359
critical point is it it's not no

685
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,200
maintenance especially the infills right

686
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,278
the various amount of infils you can

687
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,399
infils you can use the various sports

688
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,000
that move the stuff around but here's my

689
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,959
question since you're on the hot seat

690
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,359
here today brother Pro this might be the

691
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,880
last time we get you but when you sit

692
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,278
down okay so they said don't be so

693
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,360
progress so I'm assuming you reach out

694
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,159
to people with involved in Synthetic

695
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,558
Turf and I can tell you that when I've

696
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,440
sat in the same room giving a natural

697
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,000
Turf talk after a Synthetic Turf talk no

698
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,880
knock on the science of Synthetic Turf

699
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,319
but the guy before me sound like he was

700
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,679
selling a carpet for your living room

701
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,319
the various stitchings and weavings and

702
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
logos and things you could get on there

703
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,158
and when I brought up safety everybody

704
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,599
was like what's what's this guy talking

705
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,120
about wait wait there's something wrong

706
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,719
with Synthetic Turf that's the first

707
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,278
part of it a lot of those people

708
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,120
involved in helping inform the decision

709
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,720
they're looking even the guys at the

710
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,199
school grounds level they're looking to

711
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,000
influence that did the Synthetic Turf

712
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,159
guys get a little defensive are they a

713
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,880
little uh squirly when it comes to it

714
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,159
because I know the natural Turf guys are

715
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,960
a little squirly about Synthetic Turf

716
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,039
are the Synthetic Turf guys equally a

717
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,360
little defensive about it no no comment

718
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,720
no I'm

719
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,798
joking yeah yeah I mean they all are

720
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,558
right they all want to push their

721
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,960
product and they all want to push their

722
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,639
their their initiative and but to me the

723
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,360
the Synthetic Turf companies that were

724
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,320
really on board from the GGO for my

725
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,398
initial ask to be a part of this project

726
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,759
are the ones that truly do care about

727
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:02,959
putting out useful information and

728
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,759
unbiased information and so I I've I've

729
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,200
starting to internally identify who

730
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:09,119
those people are and to me I think

731
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,798
that's good I think they should do that

732
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,239
and they're all for it and they

733
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,000
understand that things might not benefit

734
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,480
them but they also understand things

735
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,119
probably could benefit them um and it's

736
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
not going to be beneficial to one

737
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,519
specific sector right there's going to

738
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,440
be benefits and disadvantages of

739
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,278
everything that we found in this St yeah

740
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,840
and so you might as well get used to

741
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,720
your success in this project likely with

742
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,038
both sides feeling a little bit upset

743
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,360
with you which is a space Carl and I

744
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,839
have inhabited for a number of years so

745
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,879
welcome to the club we're making up

746
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,839
shirts Carl we got any questions uh from

747
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,919
the audience on cha for Chase or any

748
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,759
more from you uh let's see no questions

749
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,679
one question I have uh Chase is uh have

750
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,119
you guys thought about you know like

751
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,320
we're talking about the decision- making

752
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,879
process and there's going to be a lot of

753
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,639
factors you guys want to just provide

754
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,278
the information for communities or or

755
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,120
school districts to to make a decis

756
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,558
ision any thought about including AI in

757
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,719
there like a decision making tool or

758
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,480
software that can help maybe they just

759
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,798
enter a couple things like we have this

760
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,360
much money we have you know these

761
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:14,200
weather conditions on a given year any

762
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,879
thoughts about a tool at the end that

763
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,000
can they can just sort of put stuff in

764
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,360
and it spits out a decision for them yep

765
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,798
absolutely so that's the end deliverable

766
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,278
that's that's like our big thing that

767
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,798
we're building towards all this data

768
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,880
feeds into a system they can go in with

769
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:32,158
their specific scenario their budget the

770
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,159
people they got hours of use whatever

771
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,159
and just spit out a recommendation

772
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,960
that's the end goal yep that's a home

773
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,640
run that well and then every so so

774
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,519
basically what's about to happen is uh

775
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,120
before you close the hood everybody's

776
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,558
going to get a chance to look under it

777
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:52,319
and have some uh influence in in what's

778
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,798
in there and then once the person are

779
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,599
you is it going to be something that

780
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,599
person using the tool is going to have

781
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:01,038
to self-identify it's like I'm an

782
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,398
administrator I'm a grounds manager or

783
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,679
it doesn't really matter you're just

784
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:09,278
have to enter in the logistics of the

785
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,840
district use and money and people and

786
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,079
stuff like that yeah the goal is to

787
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,678
identify through earlier objectives of

788
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,720
the project who those decision makers

789
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,480
are and honestly anybody can use the

790
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,159
tool but the the idea would be to

791
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,038
promote it to the actual to the decision

792
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,000
makers yeah all right because it's a

793
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:27,240
very contentious issue Chase of course

794
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,798
we know we like to fight about

795
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,200
everything up here New York we're

796
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,798
looking for a fight most Frank Frank

797
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,840
going back to your point though we don't

798
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,200
have data to support a lot of our things

799
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,558
right now any of these arguments so if I

800
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,399
have data and I'm the guy that has to be

801
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:42,960
in the middle of the back and forth I

802
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,719
can just be like look this isn't my

803
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,000
opinion this is the data so they might

804
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,000
hate that they might hate it but well

805
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,359
and that's and I tell you as we wrap up

806
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,960
that's ex probably why I formulated the

807
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,879
opinions that I have about this because

808
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,240
these are the things we have data about

809
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,600
right it's pretty good you can use these

810
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,640
synthetic surfaces uh pretty

811
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:07,158
consistently if you manage them they can

812
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,440
take more events than a natural grass

813
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,240
system maybe not by as much as people

814
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,720
think but there's some some data about

815
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,319
that there's data about heat right

816
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,558
there's uh there's data about the high

817
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:23,038
traction uh but that's it you know what

818
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:26,639
I mean I don't get into the cancer thing

819
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:30,278
I I I I I don't I don't get into the MCA

820
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,600
thing uh mean mer thing they sort of you

821
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,200
know most of the science refutes it but

822
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,199
there's some science that says there are

823
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,159
things that live in that thing now who

824
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,038
the hell knows when you got to put cork

825
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,799
or whatever stupid thing we're about to

826
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:45,759
put in there before we let you go one

827
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,759
more question have you as just a sports

828
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:53,119
turf guy uh from the old Kentucky days

829
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:55,839
with AJ Powell uh heard about the impact

830
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,439
microplastic uh issues in EU are going

831
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,439
to have on Synthetic Turf because maybe

832
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,600
our listeners are thinking about what

833
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,278
the next generation of synthetic turf's

834
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,638
going to be filled with if it's

835
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,480
infilled yeah I'm familiar I think it's

836
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:14,678
like second the the second largest

837
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,079
resource next to tires uh actual tires

838
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,399
in Europe they've identified as

839
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,798
microplastics or Synthetic Turf um I

840
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,759
don't I don't know to what degree though

841
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,359
I haven't I haven't read up on the

842
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,638
literature enough to not is it truly

843
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,599
impactful to you know humans or animals

844
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,240
or what not but it's it's something that

845
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,319
we're considering in the grant as well

846
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,919
too so I mean we're covering all aspects

847
