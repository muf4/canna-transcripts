1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,058
thank you Charlie uh you have to excuse

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,798
me I'm used to talking a lot with my

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:18,539
hands uh so I'll try to hold this close

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:22,198
but um yeah so I'm uh in the employee

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:26,160
degree program and so I also at

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,660
Moonlight as a squash breeder and

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,300
what's up

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,460
oh sorry

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm in charge of the breeding program a

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,058
lot I managed to Reading Program along

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,280
with Michael

14
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:40,859
and most people know we do all kinds of

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,320
concur bits lately the cucurbance all

16
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,840
from all over the world beans peas and

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,600
peppers but uh today I'm here to tell

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,420
you about the novel resistance Gene that

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,760
we found in cucumber to moshada

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,359
um resistance against powdery mildew and

21
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,698
our search for markers in the genome so

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,460
uh yep squash and pumpkins cucurative

23
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,739
species this time of year we all have

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,840
the uh in our bellies we have our

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,359
pumpkin pie uh we have jack-o-lanterns

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,180
on our doorsteps rotting away three main

27
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,099
species is

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,640
your your smaller Jack O'Lanterns and

29
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,039
acorn squash uh yellow squash

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,200
um spaghetti squash many others gourds

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,540
they could cover the Maxima which has

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,700
our kombucha squashes a buttercup squash

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,618
and the giant pumpkins oh you probably

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,140
saw giant pumpkins in the news recently

35
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,659
uh they broke another world record for

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,759
their size and the seeds are going for a

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,299
thousand dollars a piece so I'll make

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,759
sure to save your uh giant pumpkin seeds

39
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,740
um and then finally

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
finally as long as they don't have PVP

41
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,219
right so

42
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,959
um so and then finally we have a

43
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,078
cucumber to moshada which is we're here

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,599
to talk about today and we have our

45
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,199
um Butternut type squash uh tropical

46
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,658
pumpkins kalabatha and also um so a

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,820
processing pumpkin fields pumpkin

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,920
Dickinson which is actually if you buy

49
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,559
pumpkin pie filling in a can it

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,379
primarily comes from this species

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,878
and it's a giant watermelon shaped uh

52
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,039
pumpkin

53
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,439
um but so for powdery mildew resistance

54
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,359
between all the three species the

55
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,120
there's currently a single source of

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,040
powdery mildew resistance that Henry

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,340
Munger enter grass from cucurberta

58
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:30,000
martinisii or in the 70s and he brought

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,860
it over into cubita moshada and that

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,719
seems to be a dominant source of

61
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,900
resistance uh a chromosome 10. our novel

62
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:44,699
source of powdery mildew resistance uh

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,379
uh does not have that uh Gene so uh so

64
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,000
we wanted to go about finding out why as

65
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:50,818
we know single Gene resistances are

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,860
fragile so we're uh happy to soon be

67
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:54,958
able to offer this uh Pottery

68
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,200
multi-resistance in a commercially

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,598
viable line so we set out to identify

70
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,539
the inheritance and segregation ratios

71
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,899
for this novel powdery mildew resistance

72
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,479
uh Regina type resistant acceptable bugs

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,000
from the F2 population from our we did

74
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,060
actually a greenhouse green and a

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,919
generator where very quickly and very

76
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,920
soon going to generate Marker set and

77
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,199
identify candidate genes and created

78
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,958
some back cross populations this summer

79
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,378
so that we can

80
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,939
verify the markers and uh hopefully in

81
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,378
the next four to five years we hope to

82
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,539
have some

83
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,759
um some commercial cultivars that we can

84
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,179
offer with this uh powdery mildew

85
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,179
resistance

86
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:45,899
and so uh in order to do a screen for

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,699
powdery mildew with the F2 population I

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,239
um collected powdery mildew spores from

89
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:56,039
the fields and I inoculated a flat of a

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,180
susceptible uh susceptible plants and I

91
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:03,000
found this key for powdery mildew types

92
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,799
and it looked to me to be most likely uh

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,919
Canadia formed in Chains like a

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,560
potosphera this is a photo I took using

95
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,378
a microscope with a camera I also looked

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,360
at it with a better microscope and so it

97
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,858
seems to me to be potospherazanthi which

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,359
is not a surprise it's the most common

99
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:23,120
uh Pottery will do in the world uh air

100
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,159
Stefani chicory Sierra is the other

101
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,620
common powdery Mill to fix cucurbits but

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,439
I did not see it on there those other

103
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,600
spikes or trichomes on the leaf

104
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,180
uh so here's the setup of our Greenhouse

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,320
Green we typically had 10 plants and a

106
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,319
15 cell flat uh with forage pots

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,819
um either we had 10 plants or the F2 uh

108
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,779
10 plants and one of the controls

109
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:50,099
parental controls f1s versus f1s and

110
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,539
this is a lot doesn't look like a lot

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,460
but this is a lot of plants this is

112
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,120
close to like 500 plants me and Michael

113
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,459
spent many days uh evaluating all these

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,379
plants so it was during covert so we had

115
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,180
to wear masks and it wasn't wasn't a

116
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,219
whole lot of fun but we got it done and

117
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,439
I think uh the data will show we have

118
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,840
some high quality data and of course we

119
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,939
had a bugle in the greenhouse so we

120
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,939
could compare it to um

121
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:18,300
uh the commercial current commercial

122
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,160
source of powdery mildew resistance

123
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,259
that was produced by its lab so here's

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,900
some images of the plants to get an idea

125
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,479
of what to expect in the F2 we looked at

126
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:30,120
all the controls and we evaluated them

127
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:33,000
on the leaf surface the underside of the

128
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,160
leaf the petioles and the stem and what

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,339
you can see here is Waltham the

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,199
susceptible control has uh mildew all

131
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,679
over the lease service on the underside

132
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,840
of the leaf the patios the stems bugles

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,340
the novels the sorry bugle the

134
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,019
commercial source of pattern or mildew

135
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,119
resistance

136
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,519
um has mildew a little bit of mildew on

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,800
the on the leaf surface but not really

138
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,839
any mildew on the stems or petioles on

139
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,879
the underside of the leaf

140
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,560
um so we look at our novel source of

141
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,538
powdery mildew resistance it's hard to

142
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,699
find powdery mildew anywhere there's a

143
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:08,159
little bit of spoilation but very low

144
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,800
and it does get a little bit of necrosis

145
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,620
but uh it keeps growing and does very

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,780
well and if we look at both the f1s

147
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,819
between our novel Pottery mildew

148
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,619
resistance and well done we see uh

149
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,180
mildew all over the stems all over the

150
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,600
Leafs

151
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,418
um so it doesn't appear to be a very

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,240
dominant uh that's right

153
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:33,180
and then looking at it 20 days later we

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,939
see about the same thing uh as I just

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,478
described uh both the f1s are about

156
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:42,300
dying from powdery mildew and as is

157
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,860
welcome bugles is surviving it do okay

158
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,600
but it does have mildew on the leaf

159
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,819
surface and our but our novel Pottery

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,000
mildew resistance Source uh looks pretty

161
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,100
clean and good the leaves do finesse and

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,139
get a little cruises but whatever the

163
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,699
action of this powdery mildew resistance

164
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:01,860
is it seems to prevent any sporulations

165
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,419
and and the difference between bugle and

166
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,400
the novel Pottery military resistance

167
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:11,219
seems to be uh Leaf surface formulation

168
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,379
so then when we look at the data from

169
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,180
from me and Michael looking at these

170
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,538
hundreds of plants

171
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,038
um again yeah

172
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:22,860
stem had very little mildew on either

173
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,318
the resistance sources but there's

174
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,919
plenty of mildew susceptible in both the

175
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,180
f1s the patio is about the same seems to

176
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,279
be a little

177
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,379
something going on there with the f1s

178
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,559
get a little maybe a little qualitative

179
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,180
quantitative resistance but um and again

180
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,120
I'll leave four

181
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,759
on the bottom is about the same uh both

182
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,939
the resistance sources very low

183
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,819
um this is acceptable and f1s uh have

184
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,680
about 25 Leaf coverage but and then it

185
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,500
again when we look at the top of leaf

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,900
four for this resistance Source

187
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,959
um it is where it stands out from bugle

188
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,879
to the novel uh our novel powdery mildew

189
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,478
resistor stands out against bugle with

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,180
the pmo gene and so that's where we see

191
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,818
the difference so when

192
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,098
uh we wanted to think about the F2

193
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,300
population and what we should use to

194
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:20,219
score as resistance susceptible uh this

195
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,918
is a

196
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:27,300
a graph of the F2 scores of the whole F2

197
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,978
population and the leaf scores and so we

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,319
decided to draw this Red Line in the

199
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,360
Sand about where the

200
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,259
um at the upper bounds of the standard

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,639
deviation for uh the novel resistance

202
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,819
Source kind of saying this is about

203
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,899
where we see a lot of change and when we

204
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:49,200
ran our chi-square test for three to one

205
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,240
ratio I got a p-value of 0.427 which

206
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,040
looks very probable that this has at

207
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
least a single major Gene controlling

208
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,599
the resistance

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,220
uh and uh looks like a recessive

210
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,500
resistance perhaps there's some

211
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,680
quantitative aspects and some modifiers

212
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,720
but it looks pretty strongly to be a

213
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,219
recessive resistance or a dominant

214
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,480
susceptibility

215
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,580
um so you say Greg that was a great

216
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,680
Greenhouse Green but what about in the

217
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,720
field well this is what I saw in

218
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,139
September this year throughout all the

219
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,600
controls uh Waltham and the two f1s had

220
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,220
very little leaf left after the powdery

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,060
mildew

222
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:30,000
um and bugle had you know quite a bit of

223
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,619
leads more than Baltimore the two F ones

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,019
between our novel powdery mildew

225
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,360
resistance but our novel Pottery will do

226
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,580
resistance has this is full foliage and

227
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,580
yes it does produce fruit and they don't

228
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,800
taste too bad but they're not a type of

229
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,360
uh squash that many people would

230
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,699
recognize in this country so we're

231
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,800
looking forward to uh introgress into

232
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,740
some more common types

233
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,559
so for genotyping going back to the

234
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,700
Greenhouse Green we extracted DNA from

235
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,919
the 22 resistant and 22 susceptible F2

236
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,680
plants

237
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:08,519
and the parents we did next week 500 550

238
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:10,439
sequencing we got about 40x coverage on

239
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,139
the parents and Forex coverage on the

240
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,060
individuals in the books and

241
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:19,939
um so

242
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:25,139
uh then I ran uh the reads through a

243
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:27,420
qtl seek by all kind of package and yeah

244
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,939
output of the VCF file which would then

245
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,919
further annotated by snip bath packets

246
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,459
and

247
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,539
um

248
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:41,579
and then it takes the VC annotated VCF

249
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:44,819
file which also has a a Delta Delta snip

250
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,600
index on there so we got a a significant

251
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:51,060
hit on chromosome 13. and when it got

252
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,620
over the 99 percent uh confidence

253
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,338
interval there's a couple other places

254
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,980
where it got close to the 95 confidence

255
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:03,360
interval but uh it definitely looks like

256
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,820
uh it never breached to 95 so uh looking

257
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,800
at chromosome 13 I divided up the region

258
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,500
into about a hundred thousand base fare

259
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:14,879
chunks to try and find map to region and

260
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,759
I sent away for some primers to uh for

261
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,039
developing markers and hopefully the

262
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,379
primer should be in our mailbox right

263
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:26,159
now and so we're going to take Remnant

264
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:28,620
DNA from the resistant individuals and

265
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,719
hopefully this week run some PCR on

266
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,560
those to try to find out which markers

267
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,620
are most closely correlated with this

268
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,778
resistance trait and then fairly uh this

269
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,519
summer we'll test the markers on the

270
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,600
back cross population that I developed

271
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,940
this summer and uh soon we'll also

272
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,860
verify in a different population and

273
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,140
hopefully in three uh four to five years

274
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,800
we should be able to have a resistant

275
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:59,278
cultivar to release to The Growers and

276
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,500
seed companies so we're excited to be

277
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,700
able to offer

278
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,980
Growers and other source of powdery

279
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,959
mildew resistance and cucumber to

280
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,459
moshada that will help reduce fungicide

281
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:13,919
use and hopefully uh

282
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,838
um so the development of powdery or

283
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,338
fungicide resistant powdery mildew

284
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,779
strengths

285
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,339
thank you very much for your attention

286
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,919
and

287
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,860
thank you to my committee Michael and

288
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,860
Anna Rock Agarwal and jack for Rizzo for

289
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,940
helping me with the uh with the genetics

290
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,399
genomics and everybody in madlab helped

291
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,579
plant the seeds Courtney I think did the

292
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:41,278
seeds for the uh Greenhouse Green and

293
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,500
our Harvest fruits and all that so

294
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,778
thank you very much

295
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,899
any questions

296
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,360
yes do you have any plans to stack the

297
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,578
two genes do you need benefits from a

298
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,440
stock oh yeah we that's something we

299
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:58,019
want to try very soon and so we'll see

300
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,480
what happens and hopefully as I said

301
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,519
yeah the bugle genes on that came from

302
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,940
cucumber to martiniza is a chromosome 10

303
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,500
so hopefully they have a benefit there

304
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,940
is there tends to be a little bit of a

305
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,940
trade-off with the powdery mildew

306
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,480
resistine so we'll have to

307
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:17,579
uh and years was a lot of pottery mildew

308
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,240
um they tend to do better

309
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,578
than the susceptible cultivars so we'll

310
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,240
see if there's a benefit to having it

311
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:26,239
stacked or not

312
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,778
um great presentation

313
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,819
um I was just wondering if you know

314
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:35,399
anything about if there's any braces for

315
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,680
powdery mildew and like is there a

316
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,500
potential for like major heat resistance

317
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:43,620
for pottery mildew to overcome it

318
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,139
yeah it definitely is and that's why uh

319
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,600
I think there are as many races I think

320
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:52,079
I have a I have to look at it again

321
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,519
Henry mugger and Molly John did a lot of

322
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,319
work on that I haven't reviewed the

323
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,078
literature in a while but I'll have to

324
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,000
take a look into that but um yeah it's

325
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,458
definitely potential

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,019
yes uh I suppose you've tried or you

327
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,399
evaluated phones they were single

328
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,399
crosses between the susceptible

329
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,139
people using the reciprocal pair of

330
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,720
crosses yeah so so that's what we had

331
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,820
there when I had the two f1s I had both

332
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,800
my question is if there is any effect

333
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,200
reporter that you found that is

334
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,899
dependent on the which part is used as a

335
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,399
female or as a part of something it

336
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,120
didn't seem like there was much of an

337
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,940
effect either way I think uh if I look

338
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,679
at my data is like the scores are a

339
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,300
little flip-flopped on one or the other

340
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,059
like sometimes one did a little bit

341
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,879
better on other parts of the like the

342
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:45,239
patio or the September there wasn't much

343
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,338
uh difference and leave

344
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,959
I think either time they didn't have a

345
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,360
statistical difference between either of

346
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,958
the f1s

347
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,360
for any of the locations yes the cup of

348
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:01,759
stuff they cheat them and couldn't be uh

349
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,759
I mean decrease the signature

350
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,958
the infection right

351
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,578
sorry could you repeat I missed the

352
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,119
beginning part

353
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:14,219
oh the copper sulfate yeah

354
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,198
the question is uh

355
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,120
any differences

356
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,120
of the foreign

357
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,560
the copper sulfate uh we're not sure but

358
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,859
that would be something definitely an

359
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,479
interesting question to explore

360
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,199
okay

361
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,199
