1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,958
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,639
University so thank you so much Dan for

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,359
that introduction and thank you everyone

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,960
for coming out to the seminar today I'm

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,160
really excited to talk with you about my

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,839
work looking at the influence of

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,399
microbial Community Dynamics on the

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,559
cycling and stabilization of soil carbon

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,518
um so the first piece of this story kind

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,439
of comes

11
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:36,000
why are we interested

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:39,000
so so where that comes in is looking out

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,159
how soy carbon or soil organic matter

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,960
relates to this concept of soil health

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:48,319
and so soil health is this idea that we

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,079
have our soils maintaining this

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,198
continued ability to be a leing living

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,920
ecosystem that can sustain our plants

19
00:00:54,198 --> 00:01:00,039
animals and humans so in agriculture

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,198
looking at means sustainable and

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,519
productive soil system and where soil

22
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,359
organic comes into this equation is that

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,039
we see that it contributes to better

24
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,519
soil structure it can modulate soil

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,479
water availability it's an important

26
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,438
store of soil nutrients and then also

27
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,920
looking at the global scale it's a

28
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:24,000
globally important part so especially

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,280
understanding climate change so of

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,400
organic matter is being po that so if we

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,200
have this goal of increasing soil health

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,920
we also see that increasing soil organic

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,879
matter can help us achieve that

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,599
particularly in our agricultural soils

35
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,879
and so if we want to have this and

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,599
achieve this goal we need to understand

37
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:48,560
how soil organic matter is accumulating

38
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,078
and also how it's rain and so some re uh

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,600
some of the questions we're asking

40
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,399
ourselves when try to approach this are

41
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,038
what compounds make up S organic matter

42
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,799
and where are those compounds coming

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,960
from so last week we actually heard a

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
talk from love which was looking at this

45
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,199
first question so what compounds they're

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
making up with

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,598
Sol so my work is where they getting

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,400
into the second question of where are

49
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:16,359
these compounds coming from who is Mak

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,360
these compounds

51
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,920
that so Recent research into this has

52
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:26,518
looked at how microbial necas can be

53
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:30,119
contributing to so oranic PN also called

54
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,519
soil organic so what the study did is

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,439
they got metadata from a bunch of

56
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:39,039
different studies that measure microbial

57
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:42,759
nephros markers the extract sing organic

58
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,560
carbon and then estimated how much we

59
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,840
how much of a contribution neas was

60
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,840
making to the overall soil organic

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,519
carbon and so they looked at this across

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,840
the range of soil deps and then actually

63
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,879
see all of the deps kind together and

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,680
they looked at different types of soils

65
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:09,039
so C soil vaselin soils and then also

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,040
Forest soils and across all these

67
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,959
systems microbial necromass was measured

68
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,840
and estimated to make up around 50% of

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,519
the soil carbon and so particularly

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,640
focusing on this term of

71
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,039
necromass it's showing the importance of

72
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,479
understanding the microbial

73
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:34,400
contributions to this the import

74
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,158
microbial death cyes understand so

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,519
understanding how they're making their

76
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:42,359
ne how much they're

77
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,759
Mak so now the question becomes this is

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,080
the piece that we need to understand how

79
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,318
are we going to

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,560
measure it's not a trivial thing to so

81
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,518
typically if you think about a micro and

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,920
you think about typical microbiological

83
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,079
methods in order to measure do

84
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,000
cultivation so you would get an isolate

85
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:08,640
of the micro and grow it up in a lab

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,959
culture and use that to measure

87
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,518
death the problem comes in the soils we

88
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,639
are notoriously bad at cultivating soil

89
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,239
organisms and in fact there was recent

90
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,720
study where they took a soil sample and

91
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,599
they sequencing to see how many

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,960
different types of were there they did

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,680
that they found 31 p with

94
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,799
pres and then from 2019 they had this

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,319
new cultivation method they wanted to

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,360
use for soil microbes and they

97
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,879
cultivated the microbes and sequence the

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,280
ones they were able to

99
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,000
cultivate and when they did that they

100
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,159
found they cultivated representatives

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,680
for so cultivation is not a method that

102
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,600
we're able to use to accurately

103
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,879
represent the diversity of those be Happ

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,000
of

105
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,399
this and so because of this problem with

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,240
cultivation field is largely moved

107
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,719
towards sequencing processes so instead

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,720
of relying on cultivating these microbes

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,120
we can extract their DNA and sequen

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,120
particular recently do met genome

111
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,038
sequen but coming back to this idea of

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,038
one understand and death The genome

113
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:29,839
isn't enough for us to be able to

114
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,639
tell so you can imagine perhaps didn't

115
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,119
know what a

116
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,360
dandelion a dandelion grod death cycle

117
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,720
was we wanted to understand how it might

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,800
be different and its grow death from the

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,479
O but all you have is the Gen you're not

120
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,879
able to measure it death there's no

121
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,959
particular Gene and the genome that

122
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,439
controls the grow

123
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:56,038
dep in fact what creers have found is

124
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,879
there's a variety of gen Ro death is

125
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:02,599
something that arises from the entire

126
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,519
genome B together to create an

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,720
organism

128
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:12,639
specific so from the micro soil that

129
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,639
we're able to we know that there's

130
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:20,038
differ so this is sh the abundance of

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:25,440
microbes over time a grow Cur for

132
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,439
so as you can see the and yellow

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,478
really so similar to dandelion and tree

134
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,038
there are big differences in how these

135
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,318
anes are growing in the soil and appear

136
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,680
to have different patterns them but if

137
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,240
all we have from them is their

138
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,720
metagenome sequence or genome sequence

139
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,038
we can't tell from that what growth

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,000
death might Happ so we can't really

141
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,439
understand the necrom they might be

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,439
making and contributing to the carbon

143
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,478
and the

144
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,959
soil and so again we just run into these

145
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,560
problems we can't at microbes so we

146
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,038
can't measure both death that way even

147
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,478
if we have the genome sequence so we

148
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,120
understand the phy of the microb we

149
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:15,680
can't really use that to tell us how the

150
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,759
micr is going and Di what is the Cy so

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,680
we come back to this issue of how do we

152
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,199
make sense and

153
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,720
measure so the way that the field

154
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,120
recently has been trying to get around

155
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,280
this it's using something known as life

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,759
history strategies so this is a term

157
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,598
that's largely borrowed from

158
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,439
pinology which at one point bring into a

159
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:42,279
similar problem and it's based on this

160
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,879
idea that an organism can't be the best

161
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,318
at everything you have to make tradeoffs

162
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,199
in your general approach to life and

163
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,598
then spe specifically tradeoffs and

164
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,080
things such as your growth your resource

165
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,598
acquisition and your survival so there's

166
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,918
different Specialties that you can feed

167
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,800
into or you can be a generalist some of

168
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,318
these Specialties and that's how you

169
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,199
function and survive in your ecosystem

170
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,759
so a classic example of this is Brian's

171
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,680
competitor stress tolerator

172
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,520
andal so this is a way that he used to

173
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,519
categorize the life history strategies

174
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,959
of different plants um so for example a

175
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,799
competitor you can think of an organism

176
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:28,279
like an oak tree so this is an organism

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,680
that grows slower has more investment

178
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,559
into the ecosystem around it it's really

179
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,639
good at competing

180
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,278
resources whereas you think of a lunal

181
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,080
or be species something like a dandelion

182
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,240
it grows quickly and dies quickly its

183
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,600
goal is to produce a lot of Offspring

184
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,879
and it's not

185
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,519
investing and then finally you have a

186
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,519
sun or something that's stress or

187
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,519
scarcity tolerant and the goal of these

188
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,278
organisms is not to die they can live

189
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,879
stressful environments that other

190
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,320
organisms may not be able to live on and

191
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,120
they're not trying to grow really

192
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,040
quickly or anything they're just trying

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,399
not to die and so when we look and come

194
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,319
back and think about applying this to

195
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,958
microbes again we have this observation

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,200
that growth and death Cycles are

197
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,439
differing in different microbial

198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,399
communities so we have this kind of

199
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,680
sense that there might be a difference

200
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,399
in life history strategy between

201
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,679
different microbes that could help us

202
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,159
understand what function they're having

203
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,599
in the soil and so so the question

204
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,919
becomes is there a way similar to what's

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,200
been done in plants that we're able to

206
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,240
find tradeoff traits in

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,120
microorganisms that we can use to define

208
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,839
what specialty they might be have having

209
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,799
in the soil so their investment into

210
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,000
things such as growth resource

211
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,000
acquisition and survival and so that's

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,600
really where the first question and

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,360
first part of the project comes in is

214
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,839
can we build a life history framework

215
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,879
that explains microbial growth and death

216
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,680
behaviors and explains the different

217
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,958
special TOs and Life Strategies that

218
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,199
microbes might be having in soil and so

219
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:15,719
previous work in this area has largely

220
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,759
um started trying to apply like historys

221
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,680
to microorganisms and one of the first

222
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,278
questions that you have to ask yourself

223
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,599
is well what traits are we trying to

224
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,879
look at inps to be able to measure this

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,399
so in Plants the way again these

226
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,759
Concepts is far far from plant ecology

227
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,200
people have found things such as Leaf

228
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,360
area Leaf dry matter content and

229
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,399
specific Leaf area be related to life

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,399
history strategy so measuring these

231
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,399
traits tells you something about how

232
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,200
plant is investing in energy to be a

233
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,600
specialist in surviving in its work in

234
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,519
its environment so from this you were

235
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,839
able to understand the life history

236
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,360
strategy and comes to microbes though

237
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,079
there's no beles that we can measure in

238
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,919
fact going through and looking at

239
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:08,120
microbes even through a microscope is

240
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,278
really an impossible task when you're

241
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,240
looking at a soil that can have billions

242
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:16,200
and billions of microbes in it so as I

243
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,039
mentioned before our way of kind of

244
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
looking

245
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,799
at

246
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,959
is

247
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,958
sequences and but again with grow of

248
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,919
depth you can't look at just a single

249
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,039
gene or a single set of gen so instead

250
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,120
what we're interested in looking at is

251
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,799
what I'm calling

252
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,639
GS so in this case um kind of explaining

253
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,319
what I'm mean by General genomic

254
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,240
features and looking at zooming out a

255
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,920
bit on your goo and understanding what

256
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,919
general tools you have to accomplish

257
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,838
different tasks in life um so an example

258
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,039
could be a membrane transporter how much

259
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,600
of your genome is made up of transported

260
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:01,278
so how much are you able to pull stuff

261
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,480
in across your cell wall push stuff out

262
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,639
across your cell wall and how might that

263
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,120
be related then to what you're doing in

264
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,399
the ecosystem your overall approach to

265
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,120
life another example could be

266
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,240
transcription factors so in the genome

267
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,600
transcription factors help you turn off

268
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,959
and turn on gen they help you control

269
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,199
your gene expression so if you can

270
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,879
imagine the environments that perhaps is

271
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:29,719
not good for microbi it's nutrient

272
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,320
deficient and if we have two micro one

273
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,959
that has many transcription factors and

274
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,480
one that only

275
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,879
has living in and then suddenly there's

276
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,278
a washing Nutri in the environment you

277
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,480
have very

278
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,519
good imagine that perhaps the with many

279
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,879
transcription fact is able to respond

280
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,519
more quickly to this change environment

281
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,519
and change its gene expression to turn

282
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,560
on its quote

283
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,120
and so it's quickly able to respond and

284
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,559
begin replicating in this

285
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,720
the of my a few transcription factors

286
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,958
can't change as quickly so it's not able

287
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,680
to start replicating it as quickly and

288
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,838
so these perhaps General features such

289
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,759
as transcri factors have an influence on

290
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,760
the growth and death and responsive

291
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,919
responsiveness of a microorganism in

292
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:27,919
soil environment it's overall

293
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:30,958
like so current work in this field has

294
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:34,039
really looked at making an overall life

295
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,159
his first going in and defining what we

296
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:40,519
think the different life history grou

297
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:43,799
things objects would be so using

298
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:47,759
understand Theology and trying to come

299
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,719
up with on the firsthand what they think

300
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,958
could be and then they go and look for

301
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,040
genomic features that are interesting

302
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:59,159
and potentially related to these

303
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:01,958
categories that so what I'm proposing is

304
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,360
do the opposite of that and start by

305
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,719
looking into the genomic features

306
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,959
particularly ones that seem interesting

307
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,160
and they would be training off to define

308
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:16,518
your general approach so instead of

309
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:20,159
applying to the genomic data I'm using

310
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:23,078
the genomic data to inform my

311
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,879
cre and then once I am finding an

312
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,758
analyzing those genomic features using

313
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:31,838
those to tell me what Specialties do I

314
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,399
think my soil environment by might be

315
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,240
trading off against and using that to

316
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,679
Define my things and again so we have

317
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,680
evidence shown this figure quite a few

318
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,120
times microbes are growing differently

319
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:48,439
in the soil they have different go deps

320
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,879
like we also have evidence that General

321
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,240
genomic features like I mentioned so

322
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,919
this case membrane transport qu the

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,039
prescription factors are associated with

324
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,000
each other so in this case have an organ

325
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,240
these two factors are positively

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,720
correlated with each other have high

327
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,519
membrane transmits who also appear to

328
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,639
have transcription factors so we can

329
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,120
imagine an organism that occupies this

330
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,680
side of the gra might be having a very

331
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,000
different life history strategy with

332
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:24,439
organism that occupies a point where

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,440
they have low transcription factors and

334
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,399
low membrane

335
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,759
transs so that really defines the first

336
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,120
what the first part of my work things to

337
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,800
build on is examining genomes and

338
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,318
metagenomes from the soil and looking

339
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,639
for Gen these General genomic features

340
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:44,639
that appear to be showing a trade-off

341
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,120
indicative of specializing into a

342
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,480
certain life history strategy or have

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,799
interesting relationships to the

344
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,240
potential growth in death or life

345
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,519
history of

346
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,318
N and then from that I would use those

347
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,360
features I've identified to understand

348
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:04,679
what those different Specialties could

349
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,800
be and how those could be related again

350
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,359
to how the organism overall is

351
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,159
approaching its life history and what

352
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,000
it's doing in a soil

353
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,278
environment and so at the conclusion of

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,440
this my hope would be that we could take

355
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,318
the genomes of or organisms and the

356
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,319
metagenomes of organisms and use that

357
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:27,879
along plot this to understand what sort

358
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,159
of Niche and what sort of ecological

359
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,120
nich the organ

360
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:37,439
from that get a sense of its dep as well

361
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,600
as other factors related to how it's

362
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,680
functioning and so when we're thinking

363
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,440
back to this growth and depth it's we

364
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,159
want to also understand why would this

365
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,639
be important for the soil carbon and so

366
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,958
we have some initial hypothesis about

367
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,000
how some of these potential Mings could

368
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:57,278
relate to soil carbon so if we had a

369
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,639
growth adapted organism you think about

370
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,198
a Lal or a Dand

371
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,000
perhaps that's an organism that's

372
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,399
producing large amounts of it's growing

373
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,480
and dying rapidly in the environment so

374
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,240
it's producing a lot of and then if we

375
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,679
go to a competition adapted organism you

376
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,798
think about like an oak tree perhaps

377
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,199
it's producing an intermediate amount of

378
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,759
necromass it's not growing as much it's

379
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,519
not dying as much um we're still trying

380
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,959
to understand how that relate this

381
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,519
production but then if you think about a

382
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,400
scarcity adopted organism organism

383
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,480
that's goal is just don't die it's not

384
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,559
producing a lot of NE mass and you can

385
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,160
imagine how being uh occupying these

386
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:45,200
different spectrums of specialty that

387
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,558
then go on and influence how the

388
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,000
microbial Community is contributing to

389
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:54,399
soil Caron and the accumulation of soil

390
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,240
again matter so that is the first part

391
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,840
of my work is kind of nailing down and

392
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,679
defining what these different life

393
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,199
hisory strategies could be and how we

394
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,559
can achieve them and the subsequent

395
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,880
questions I would have is maybe going

396
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,158
back into the field and getting closer

397
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,640
and closer back to that question of the

398
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,760
influence on so of the get matter so one

399
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,360
of the questions would be do our

400
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,519
management practices influence what life

401
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,199
history groups are present in the soil

402
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,038
or what the diff the relative

403
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,519
composition of those different life

404
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,200
history groups are so for example I

405
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,679
would look at hillage because we know

406
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,159
tillage Alters the composition of the

407
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,720
mobial but we don't know how it might

408
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:41,440
impact what ecological nich these

409
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,079
different soil organisms are occupi or

410
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,038
what their specific Specialties might be

411
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,480
and that could be what's important for

412
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:54,000
understanding and the final question

413
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,079
which is really related to that as I do

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,119
these different life history groupings

415
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,599
actually matter for Sol car so we have

416
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:04,158
some hypo IES again about how they could

417
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,359
be related to necromass production but

418
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,720
actually going out in field and using

419
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,639
soils to study if these life history

420
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,240
strategies differences in that

421
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:19,840
composition have consequences for um the

422
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,480
eventual carbon fuel syst so that really

423
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,678
is a summary of what I'm going be doing

424
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,480
focused heavily on the beginning work

425
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,759
and alluding

426
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,038
to um thank you all so much for

427
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,038
listening and I'm happy to

428
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,919
talk right well that's honestly is a

429
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:01,798
problem I think

430
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,798
that strategy so

431
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,159
allows

432
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:13,158
theying

433
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,159
change

434
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:20,879
set so I think the swapping really an

435
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:25,399
issue of trying to focus specifically on

436
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,400
biologically and understand

437
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,960
this one

438
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,200
changes so what's going on right now

439
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,798
my

440
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,519
file

441
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:15,480
change I get it thank you

442
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,000
yeah that's a very naive question how do

443
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,919
you measure a necromass I can see a dead

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,960
animal or a dead plant how do I know

445
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,720
that that thing in the soil is a dead

446
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,840
micro

447
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,880
see so what they used is a marker of

448
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:34,158
microbial cell wall composition so in

449
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,200
that study specifically they broke it up

450
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:42,000
into bacterial fungal so they extracted

451
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:45,360
the carbon measured the amount ofic acid

452
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,480
which is a bacterial cell comp and then

453
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,158
glucos is

454
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,599
fos and then they had an equation for

455
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:58,080
converting that into an estimate of

456
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,798
necromass based on how much of the cell

457
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:05,439
that cell while showing came from

458
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:08,440
mic yeah those are unique signatures

459
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,440
to

460
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:29,319
yeah I think there lot of debate on that

461
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:32,558
yes yeah so it it is

462
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,639
um but as you may have learned from the

463
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:38,440
presentation last week as many people in

464
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,679
thisi really hard to tell what's going

465
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:45,480
into sort

466
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,480
of so those are signatures that we're

467
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,720
trying I have about I'm kind of very

468
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:03,720
curious about

469
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,720
stud mention about how

470
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,359
the

471
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:24,480
and yes yes we do so it Al this is

472
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:27,119
coming largely from conceptology so

473
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,120
plantology um we think about like hist

474
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,558
strategy something that encourages PLS

475
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,278
that are able

476
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,278
to kind of

477
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,919
come soil up and K all the plants that

478
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,919
are there first

479
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:51,000
one so our initial hypothesis going into

480
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:54,359
this is that a similar thing

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,519
occur think especially you

482
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,519
have a lot

483
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,918
go

484
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,918
that destroy

485
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,919
perhaps

486
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,519
that

487
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,399
inth thank you for the wonderful

488
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,599
introduction and good afternoon everyone

489
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,959
as he said my name is Alex yor and I'll

490
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,038
be giving my M exam seminar presentation

491
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,079
entitled Dynamic crop growth data for

492
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:39,278
predicting nitrogen status Ma so as most

493
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,480
or probably all of you know nitrogen is

494
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:45,119
very critical fertilizer for any

495
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,599
agronomic system very particularly maze

496
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:51,359
um so what happens is it's often

497
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,000
overapplied in heals and this this is

498
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,918
the simple reason is this is sort of a

499
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,480
cheap insurance policy to protect

500
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,919
against uncertainties in the season a

501
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,480
lot of things can happen from the time

502
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,559
you plant and the time you fertilize

503
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,120
till the time you actually Harvest so

504
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,918
applying a little extra nitrogen is

505
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,439
typically thought of as a as a

506
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,038
reasonable practice um but there's a

507
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,399
fine line between sort of managing yield

508
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,440
loss and then offloading nitrogen into

509
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:16,959
the

510
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,840
environment because again as most of you

511
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
probably know nitrogen is very reactive

512
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,158
in the environment it's very mobile move

513
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,159
around a lot um so this can cause a lot

514
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,760
of ecological harm when it's overapplied

515
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,200
you know so you get a big Rin after you

516
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,278
apply now you're washing into water ways

517
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,240
you're doing a lot of lot of harm to S

518
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,000
ecosystem there's potential human health

519
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,038
effects and then we also have you know

520
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,440
nitrous oxide emissions this is a major

521
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,119
greenhouse gas so this can be very

522
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,000
problematic um typically what's done

523
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,639
what's very common is uniform

524
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,558
application nitrogen field so you pick a

525
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,278
rate maybe you add 20% or something like

526
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:54,079
that but you apply that same amount

527
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,159
across the field irrespective of where

528
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,639
it's needed or where it's not needed as

529
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,200
much even in Precision system Sy where

530
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
they have a little more control over

531
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,319
rates and have a little more spatial

532
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,760
control um typically this is done with

533
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,639
like a static piece of information like

534
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:13,038
last year's yield map and so you'll use

535
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,278
some algorithm to to derive a rate for

536
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,038
particular areas of your field but again

537
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,398
you're using this sort of single point

538
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,359
data whether it's ndvi map or a field

539
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,119
map so this sort of led me to this

540
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:28,798
question of can we use some kind of

541
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:31,479
dynamic model to inform our nitrogen

542
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,599
application rates um at at a spatial

543
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:37,558
scale and so what I what I mean by a

544
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:40,480
dynamic by a dynamic model

545
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,960
is instead of taking a single point like

546
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,278
a single ndvi image take more of a Time

547
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,399
series can we get some additional

548
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,398
information from this time series

549
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:51,599
leading up to the time when you would

550
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:54,079
fertilize to give us a better sense of

551
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,639
what the nitrogen status actually

552
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,759
can so to do this we measured crop

553
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,120
height two to three times a week in our

554
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,879
fields we performed spectral

555
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,558
measurements about once or twice a week

556
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,240
and then we did nitrogen status

557
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,079
measurement of the actual plants then we

558
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,159
fit a model to the whole thing to kind

559
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:14,439
of try to tie it all together and one

560
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,240
thing I really want to point out is we

561
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,240
do not use yield data in this because I

562
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,720
imagine somebody would ask because any

563
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,440
agronomic Pursuit sort of the pair

564
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,720
amount becomes yield you know you want

565
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,038
to know how's this going to affect my

566
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,640
yield is it going to hurt my yield is it

567
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,640
going to help my yield is it going to

568
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,600
maximize it and so I want I just want to

569
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,600
point out now that're we didn't look at

570
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,000
yield in this part of the study and this

571
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,918
is actually part of a broader body of

572
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,798
work that we actually do have the entire

573
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,559
growth ratees the entire season will

574
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:44,798
have field data um but for the purposes

575
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:46,359
of this project not looking at that so

576
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,359
this took place over a few different

577
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:50,918
sites so here in Ithaca we had three

578
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,038
different sites across three years 2021

579
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,799
through

580
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:57,558
2023 and we what we did is we had two

581
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,398
separate planting dates per Fields we're

582
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,319
calling those different site year

583
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,199
because you essentially have created a

584
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,319
different environment if you plant two

585
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,080
weeks later you're you're sort of

586
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,278
changing the environment a little bit at

587
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,839
least in terms of weather pattern things

588
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,079
like that so we have three sites three

589
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,839
years here in itha we also partnered

590
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,119
with our colleagues at Agriculture and

591
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,000
AG Canada which if you're not aware is

592
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,839
essentially the the Canadian version of

593
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,359
the

594
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:26,639
USDA they provided us with one year of

595
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:29,199
data this past year 2023 same protocol

596
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,720
where they did two different plant dates

597
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,000
um and they had three different fields

598
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,200
they're calling them blocks but there're

599
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,720
three separate Fields within this within

600
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,519
this area so this is this is a map of

601
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,278
theirs at L um which is just south of

602
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,079
Montreal so there's their three

603
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:45,839
different fields again two planting

604
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,278
dates as I mentioned the little squares

605
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,798
we'll talk about in a moment these are

606
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:55,558
our three sites so 2021 we were at the

607
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,319
gallon Woods 2022 we were at calwell

608
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:00,558
field which you probably know is over by

609
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:03,519
the um by green houses and then 2023

610
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,398
we're a couple miles away in Bara most

611
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,480
of the rest of the talk will focus

612
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,398
primarily on 2023 data um with a little

613
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,880
bit of

614
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:15,798
2021 primarily on our on last year's

615
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,440
data so what we did is we mapped out the

616
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:19,519
field as you can see professional

617
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,399
longshan here with his backpack with

618
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,839
this funny little antenna on it so what

619
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:26,518
this is is it's an rtk GPS what this

620
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,759
does is it allows us to have sort of

621
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,359
centimeter level resolution

622
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:32,480
within the field so we can walk around

623
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:36,119
the field and know where we arein a

624
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,679
couple cim accuracy about ctim accuracy

625
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,239
and what we did is so as promised the

626
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,320
little squares so what these little

627
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
squares are they're they're 3 meter

628
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,879
pixels within the field and so we

629
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,519
flagged out the corners of these and

630
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,880
again that's why we needed this high

631
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,599
resolution uh GPS so that we could map

632
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,399
this out precisely the reason we chose

633
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:57,879
the size and the orientation is because

634
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,879
this is based on planet satellites which

635
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,200
is if you're not aware is sort of a it's

636
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,519
a daily pass high resolution satellite

637
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,440
product um basically they've sent a an

638
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,359
entire swarm of little satellites up

639
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,759
into the sky and so it allows them to

640
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:15,278
give us daily entry so we we match that

641
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,319
to their grid so that we can use this

642
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,000
for further work with with the satellite

643
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,359
data and as I mentioned we have two

644
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
different planting dates so the southern

645
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:24,119
half of the field was planted around L

646
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,839
May second half of fields about two

647
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,319
weeks

648
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,599
later for the height measurement pretty

649
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,798
straightforward um you can see up there

650
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,759
there's sort of a zip tie encircling the

651
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,200
plant so we did this with all the plants

652
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,558
we actually went back and measured the

653
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,200
same plants every time we measured and

654
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,639
there are 10 of them within each field

655
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,080
with a specific colored zip tie so we

656
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,120
could actually track the growth of

657
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,119
individual plants this doesn't play as

658
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,918
much into this particular project but we

659
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,959
did want to have that granularity for

660
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,840
later ultimately what we did is we

661
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,519
average pixel the the height so we have

662
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,000
sort

663
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,399
of average height for the for the

664
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,240
individual 3x3 meter pixel this

665
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,638
corresponded well with what they did in

666
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,399
Canada which is where they just averaged

667
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:09,439
the averaged value didn't didn't have

668
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,119
this sort of granularity of data uh we

669
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,798
measured from the soil surface to the

670
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,599
highest lead and I want to point out

671
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,440
that we did unmanipulated that is we

672
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,678
didn't move the leaf in any way or we

673
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,200
didn't stretch it out so there's a

674
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,200
pretty standard protocol a lot of times

675
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,360
you will you know hold the leaf up to

676
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,360
its highest point and measure that way

677
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,678
the reason we chose not to do that and

678
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,558
to do it this way is we wanted to

679
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,320
correspond this more closely to what you

680
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,720
would see would say a lar image where

681
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,960
you're not actually touching the plant

682
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,960
you can't affect it it's just how the

683
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,720
plant sits where it is what is the

684
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,278
height that way so we we wanted to

685
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,798
measure that way and as I said there

686
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,880
were 10 plants per pixel that we're

687
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,759
measuring Al average looks for average

688
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,840
height over that three that 9 square

689
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,720
meter

690
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:56,038
area go so for the spectral measurement

691
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,360
we used the ASD field spec handheld

692
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:59,919
although we didn't use it handheld we

693
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,798
used it on the boom and on a ladder so

694
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,519
we did this to get about four meters

695
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,398
above the above the soil surface the

696
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,359
reason we did this is because the spot

697
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:12,359
size of the actual device comes out to

698
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,158
about three and a half meters at that

699
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,240
height so it worked out perfectly nearly

700
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,120
perfectly with our with our pixel size

701
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,759
so we would we would stand up on a

702
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:24,678
ladder and measure straight down that

703
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,558
was how we got our spectral data um one

704
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,278
of the one of the challenges with this

705
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,519
is it requires a lot of calibration so

706
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,000
you can see on the right um my colleague

707
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,200
here holding up this device called

708
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,759
spectralon essentially just like a pure

709
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,600
white reflective surface that we were

710
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,759
able to get sort of a white balance for

711
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,918
our device but we had to do this every

712
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,079
10 to 15 minutes field so as we're going

713
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,519
along we're constantly recalibrating to

714
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,678
make sure we have the most accurate data

715
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,120
now our wise Canadian friends used a

716
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,480
drone to give their special data and

717
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:58,038
having walked through the field of the

718
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,038
ladder a lot I'm a little jealous

719
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:02,798
so again because we were trying to tie

720
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,079
this to this sort of Planet satellite

721
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,599
data what we did is we took this um so

722
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,960
this this figure on the right is sort of

723
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,480
a typical days measurement from the ASD

724
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,798
and it's it's a hyperspectral instrument

725
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,159
so we're actually getting single

726
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:20,720
nanometer resolution from 325 to 375 to

727
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,679
1025 and what we did is we broke this

728
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,399
down into individual bands and these

729
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,880
bands correspond to the planet super

730
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:28,638
Dove which is the current instruments

731
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,679
that are up right now so we wanted to

732
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:33,719
match up that band structure so that we

733
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,519
could ultimately use this data use this

734
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,519
protocol with the satellite data

735
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,359
later so for nitrogen status measurement

736
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,399
we did in 2021 and two we did a nitrate

737
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,038
sa test so this is taking fresh plants

738
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:50,079
and actually measure the amount of

739
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,759
nitrate within that um again since we're

740
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,000
not focusing as much on the 2021 and two

741
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:57,759
data don't don't worry too much about

742
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,679
that so for 2023 what we did is nitrogen

743
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,440
n index what this is is essentially a

744
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,120
measure of the nitrogen in the field or

745
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,759
the nitrogen in your plants relative to

746
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,719
a sort of critical nitrogen

747
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,039
concentration this critical nitrogen

748
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,039
concentration is a sufficient level for

749
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,918
growth at least theoretically and it

750
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,719
tends to be a pretty good standard

751
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,039
pretty good Hallmark for this for this

752
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,799
kind of work so for this we actually

753
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,519
took dyy plant so we did destructive

754
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,240
sampling in and around the pixels in

755
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:32,719
question and then deriv with n values

756
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,439
from that this protocol is also followed

757
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,398
we have consistent measurements of

758
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,918
nitrogen so this is a typical plot of

759
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,239
our height so the individual points are

760
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,319
the actual measurements where we

761
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,918
measured the height and what we did is

762
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,559
we fit this exponential curve and so if

763
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,638
you know a little bit about sort of corn

764
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,918
growth or plant growth in general if you

765
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,878
look throughout the if you sort of

766
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,279
project this out through the whole

767
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,519
season you're going to see sort of a

768
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,040
logistic curve and fit really well

769
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,599
because we're not looking at the entire

770
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,159
season we're just looking at this early

771
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,320
stage growth the exponential model

772
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,000
actually fits really well and if you've

773
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,519
seen a logistic model essentially the

774
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,159
first half of it is an exponential so

775
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:16,400
this actually fit really well from this

776
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:18,199
curve we gen we generated a growth rate

777
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,480
which essentially how fast is it growing

778
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,358
at that last

779
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,880
measur in centimeters per day so our

780
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:28,000
exponential fits were really good our

781
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,280
mean r squar was 997 exponential F I

782
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,239
mean you can see that there's pretty

783
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,200
strong pretty strong relationship there

784
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,159
it fit really well so we so we went with

785
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:39,519
this calculated the growth rate from

786
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:42,399
that this is for 113 pixels so this is

787
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,599
including the Canadian as well as the

788
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,599
itha locations for all three

789
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,838
years we did a similar process for ndvi

790
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,920
again the points are the actual measured

791
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,199
ndvi or calculated ndvi in this case we

792
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,800
calculated sort of an ndvi growth rate

793
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,239
or the ndvi increase rate so how fast

794
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,318
the ndbi increasing at that last

795
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,838
measurement day right before side

796
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:06,639
dress the fit was not quite as strong

797
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:08,119
for exponential and you can just see you

798
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,239
know this is just a typical plot and the

799
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,200
points were a little bit off um but our

800
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,959
our mean r squar was about

801
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:18,759
86 the N is a little bit lower so we had

802
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,559
only 95 points here because the 2021

803
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,880
data would not have spectral data so

804
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,719
that that's not included

805
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,640
this now looking at our static model and

806
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,199
again by Static model I'm saying a

807
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,960
single data point so if you're just

808
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,559
looking at this one point just the

809
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,679
height if you measure one time right

810
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,279
before side you measure the height how

811
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,879
good of an indicator is that of the

812
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,440
nitrogen status not bad I mean we're

813
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:47,240
looking at about a 68 R squar for this

814
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,119
um this this is nni versus height but

815
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:52,279
what we wanted to see is okay we're

816
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,800
we're looking specifically at this one

817
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,560
day right before side dress what about

818
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,880
all the other days before that are there

819
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,639
other days that might be better

820
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,200
predictor and so as we sort of move down

821
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,960
along this curve looking towards

822
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:07,118
planting date um we see the R square

823
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,838
drop off pretty prly there's no real

824
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,800
Improvement here with the static model

825
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:13,279
we looking backwards in time we're

826
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,200
trying to predict it a week earlier now

827
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,280
if we look at our Dynamic model again

828
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,318
this is height so we're looking at nni

829
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,680
but now we're looking at growth rate so

830
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:23,440
this is that the slope of that curve

831
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,639
essentially at that last point so this

832
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,880
is our growth rate the dynamic model

833
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,838
which we've derived from the actual IAL

834
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,760
curve so for this our R squ was about 64

835
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,799
still not bad for predicting nitrogen

836
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,000
and again we wanted to look and see okay

837
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,359
what if we move back through time and

838
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,239
sort of move our way through here how

839
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,880
good of a bit do we get and you see

840
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,919
there's a there's a little bump so the

841
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,680
red line indicates the r squar of our

842
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,760
leftand lot which is measuring just at

843
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,838
the last date but now if you measure

844
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,280
about a week earlier you get a pretty

845
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,159
significant bump in accuracy so we

846
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,079
actually just a little bit higher than

847
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,679
the static model in this case about a

848
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,240
week earlier so this is actually good

849
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:09,039
news because typically you want a little

850
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:10,598
bit of lead time to be able to plan this

851
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,679
thing out if you if you're going to use

852
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,599
this sort of tool to indicate how much

853
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,759
to fertilize it'd be nice to know that a

854
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,800
few days earlier also sort of projecting

855
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,839
forward into using satellite data this

856
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,440
would be really important because as we

857
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:27,000
all know here Clow is going to be a big

858
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,599
issue with satellite data um so having

859
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,960
that of time where you actually have a

860
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,079
still a decent decent accuracy is really

861
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,920
important so now again looking at the

862
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,039
static model this is for ndvi now same

863
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,720
thing if we just take the ndvi value at

864
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,559
that last Point what do we get uh the R

865
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:48,559
square is not great about3

866
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:51,039
33 again if we look and project this out

867
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,880
and look back in time how early can we

868
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,358
get a better measurement well we really

869
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,240
can't any anytime you go back through

870
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,960
it's going to just drop one thing I do

871
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,879
want to point out though is for our

872
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:07,358
height model the actual measured height

873
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,519
and the projected height for for our

874
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,239
last day were spoton they were the same

875
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,159
the modeled and the measured were almost

876
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,318
identical you saw that from

877
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:19,440
099 um r s in this case there was a

878
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:22,119
little bit of a discrepancy between the

879
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,400
modeled value so the red line here is

880
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,640
the actual measurement R squ so

881
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,838
corresponding to the figure on the left

882
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,199
but now this is looking at the point the

883
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:33,960
actual measurement but if you take the

884
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:35,639
the point on the curve as opposed to the

885
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,519
measured point we actually get a little

886
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:41,039
bit better accuracy that way but again

887
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,000
moving down going back through time our

888
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,400
accuracy just dropped if you go earlier

889
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,159
earlier in the season now with our

890
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,680
Dynamic model for ndvi and again this is

891
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,118
looking at that increase rate of ndvi

892
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,598
how fast is the nvi increasing at that

893
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,720
last date uh in this case we got an R

894
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,599
square about 049 so this is pretty

895
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,239
significant improvement over the static

896
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,079
model and so this sort of underlies this

897
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:07,279
sense of you know using a single point

898
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:09,359
ndvi to trying to predict nitrogen

899
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
status is maybe not the best and a

900
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:15,119
dynamic model may actually have some

901
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,119
improvement over this and similarly as

902
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,000
we go back in time about five days we

903
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,519
get a little bit of a bump and a little

904
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,920
bit of an increase in the overall

905
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,318
accuracy of the

906
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,240
model now comparing the static and

907
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,199
dynamic models as we just mentioned the

908
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:33,439
the overall R squar was actually just a

909
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,399
little bit higher for the static model

910
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,960
but this is only for the date right

911
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,318
before side dress if we actually look

912
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,280
across all days again we have this

913
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,318
little bit of room for improvement which

914
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,000
which takes the dynamic model just kind

915
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,599
of eats out the the static model in this

916
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,639
case but again because now we're a week

917
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,400
earlier that we can make this prediction

918
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,598
that's really important one for planning

919
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,920
purposes and also giving us a window as

920
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,880
we sort of this process into satellite

921
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,800
data similarly for the ndvi except in

922
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,640
this case we did see a pretty big

923
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,839
increase between the static and dynamic

924
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,400
model directly in the last day but then

925
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,000
we also have this little bump of

926
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,838
improvement about five days L again this

927
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,880
is really helpful for planning and also

928
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:19,920
sort of mitigating issues they trying to

929
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,920
get satellite right

930
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,599
on so to sort of wrap this all up and

931
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,318
bring it together so we looked at these

932
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,640
Dynamic model fits so our height model

933
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,920
model there was not really any

934
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:34,000
improvement with the dynamic model over

935
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,599
the static model at the final

936
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,519
measurement date but we did see a slight

937
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,039
Improvement about a week earlier so

938
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,880
we're predicting a week for side dress

939
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,039
we actually have a slightly better

940
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,200
chance of predicting that nitrogen

941
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,079
status with the ndvi we saw about a 50%

942
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:53,318
Improvement in the accuracy of the

943
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,039
dynamic model versus static model um we

944
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:56,920
didn't get quite as much of a benefit

945
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,838
from going earlier but there was still a

946
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,680
benefit and the overall fit is

947
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:06,318
better some of the limitations of how we

948
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,679
how this study went one of the ones is

949
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,318
just the noisy spectral data it's it's

950
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,960
just inherently noisy I mean you saw how

951
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,559
we're doing it I'm up here on a boom you

952
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,838
know we were pretty accurate about our

953
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,279
Heights and things like that and aiming

954
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:22,279
but there's just inherent challenges

955
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,480
with that um a tiny Cloud passing in

956
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,440
front of the sun when you're taking the

957
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,719
measurement could really affect that

958
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,519
spectral reading we did a it over

959
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,919
multiple measurements to sort of take

960
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:34,639
care of that as best we could but

961
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,240
there's still a lot of noise in there

962
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,838
one thing that we didn't look at that I

963
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,919
think would be really helpful is looking

964
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,838
at the differences between sight ears

965
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,960
and this is sight ears from one half of

966
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:45,279
the field to the other with the

967
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,079
different planting dates but also

968
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,920
between the different sites that is itha

969
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,000
versus versus Canada even looking at our

970
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,880
previous years and see the differences

971
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,159
there there there inherently going to be

972
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,318
differences in precipitation GD that

973
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,879
they're starting with in the first

974
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:02,039
couple weeks and make a really big

975
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,280
difference on the growth so that's

976
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,800
something that that needs to be looked

977
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,240
at a little more

978
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,240
deeply and again as I mentioned in the

979
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,639
beginning we are not looking at yield

980
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,598
and again because this is sort of a

981
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,358
Paramount issue for any agronomic

982
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,720
experiment ultimately somebody wants to

983
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:19,519
know a farmer wants to know how does

984
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:21,519
this affect my bottom line how does this

985
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,519
affect my heal it's G to hurt my heel

986
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:27,800
you know is this going to be a waste of

987
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:30,119
time so you know as as we use the the

988
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,960
broader body of work that we have the

989
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,440
broader body of data that we gathered

990
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,440
from this project which actually looks

991
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,519
the entire season then we can start

992
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,920
teasing out the yield impact things like

993
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,519
that uh so the implications for future

994
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,000
work as I mentioned we want to look at

995
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,039
using satellite data to do this um as

996
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,760
fun as it was hauling a ladder through

997
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,480
seven foot tall corn I would love it if

998
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,839
I didn't have to do that and I can tell

999
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,920
you I don't know many farmers who would

1000
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:01,078
be really willing or even have the time

1001
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,599
to do that so you know drones are great

1002
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,240
if you have access to one that could be

1003
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,760
a really great way to sort of gather

1004
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,239
some of this data but ultimately it

1005
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,760
would be you know having this public

1006
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:14,358
access uh satellite data would be really

1007
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,280
powerful to sort of making this

1008
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:17,920
predictive ultimately what we like to do

1009
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,000
is make these high high resolution

1010
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,800
prescriptive end Maps so you could map

1011
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,039
out your field at 3 meter resolution and

1012
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,079
know where needs less nitrogen where is

1013
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,639
going to need more just based on this s

1014
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:32,480
icted nitrogen status using NN as

1015
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:34,480
mentioned before so with that I'd like

1016
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,400
to thank you all for being here a big

1017
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,838
thanks to my uh my advisers professor

1018
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,318
longan professor Vans um as well as Bill

1019
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:45,679
Philpot help a lot with spectral data

1020
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:48,639
the entire team at Agriculture and Agri

1021
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,318
Canada uh the entire long Shams lab past

1022
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,039
and present they've all been a part of

1023
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,119
this project and have been tremendously

1024
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:55,800
helpful as well as the Cornell Institute

1025
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,720
for digital agriculture for providing

1026
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,920
some funding for this project

1027
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,558
and then Corell farm services for all

1028
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,079
their awesome help getting our field to

1029
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:07,400
prep and and helping with all the all

1030
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,880
the management of the actual Agronomy of

1031
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,358
the thing and of course I'd like to

1032
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,880
thank all of you for being here and

1033
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:12,880
thanks for

1034
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:18,639
listening um you mentioned Harold at the

1035
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:21,239
very end and so I was already thinking

1036
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:24,159
to ask you how this might integrate with

1037
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:27,679
the adapt end approach which for that

1038
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:29,838
side rest date he'll give um because of

1039
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,480
having followed the weather the initial

1040
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,480
applications and so forth is going to

1041
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,039
give some estimate of the nitrogen

1042
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,679
status in the soil at that point you you

1043
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,880
see a complimentarity to this

1044
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:43,558
to I mean you're being more spatially

1045
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,039
resolved obviously that's one aspect but

1046
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,640
have you thought of some integration

1047
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,679
with adap yeah yeah this is something we

1048
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:51,639
we talked about a little bit um this

1049
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,960
could essentially be another piece of

1050
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:57,078
that another another way to enhance the

1051
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,519
sort of reliability of that or enhance

1052
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:01,920
accuracy of the C conditions that that's

1053
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,679
I think I think this could be a really

1054
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,920
important piece that taking some that

1055
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,919
Dynamic data as opposed

1056
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,358
to thanks great presentation uh so as

1057
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,400
far as I grasp the idea is basically

1058
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:23,639
that we use growth rate uh as an

1059
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,000
indicator of nitrogen status because

1060
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:28,159
nitrogen status is probably what uh

1061
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,079
determines our growth

1062
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,838
uh so have you thought about other

1063
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,440
factors that can be growth rate at that

1064
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:39,318
point like moisture

1065
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,880
status some that can affect your

1066
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:44,358
measurements of yourens absolutely there

1067
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,559
are because like I said especially

1068
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:47,239
between the different site years we're

1069
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,359
going to have differences in the amount

1070
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,879
of GDP that's accumulated early in the

1071
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,639
season moisture differences soil

1072
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,599
differences weeds can be a big factor so

1073
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,799
yeah there are a number of other factors

1074
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:02,280
that I think should be explored to

1075
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,280
really make this a more a

1076
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:09,819
[Music]

1077
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,669
[Music]

1078
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:25,920
model that's actually a really

1079
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,760
interesting question so we used the only

1080
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,358
difference between varieties was between

1081
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,079
Canada and us all three of our years

1082
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:36,039
used the same variety of corn so I think

1083
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,318
that' actually be a really great thing

1084
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:41,639
to look at and see you know does a

1085
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:44,159
variety that typically is going to be

1086
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,519
shorter um do we see the same thing I

1087
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:46,519
think that' be

1088
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:53,838
a maybe like we didn't see much

1089
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,000
difference between the last height and

1090
00:47:53,838 --> 00:48:00,318
the growth rate for the measurement but

1091
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,239
in this case maybe the growth rate more

1092
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:07,920
stable across varieties than the actual

1093
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,919
height which you have some

1094
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,640
shoulder all right thank you very

1095
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,920
much this has been a production of
