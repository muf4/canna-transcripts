1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,878
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,878
university

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,039
um i'm talking you i'm

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,439
speaking to you today though from my

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,559
home and roughly where that yellow star

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,600
is where i work in an

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,198
urban and regional food systems lab

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
this means that the farmers that we work

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
with

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,480
are very diverse in their

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,160
scope and practices but our research

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
broadly supports

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
farmers that are serving small-scale

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
regional markets across the upper

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,160
midwest

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,079
i also wanted to mention here that

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,319
wisconsin is also

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
home to the two working public care

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,920
readers in the state

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
and then in the nation rather and we're

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
really lucky to be able to work with

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
them on this project as well

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,119
so in order to meet the needs of the

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,679
farmers we work with who value

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,198
things like flavor and weed

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,799
competitiveness as well as open

27
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,879
pollinated varieties

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,359
we're interested in being able to use

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,118
germplasm from the usd carrot collection

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,719
in order to introduce traits that are

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,079
interest to us

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,079
the carrots in this collection are

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,879
relatively unstructured and carrot

34
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,000
itself is

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,000
an outcrossing diploid um

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,840
we are also hoping that the approach

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,719
that we're taking can serve as kind of a

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
case study

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
or a proof of concept approach for other

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,719
groups that are interested in using

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
germplasm collections

42
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,280
in breeding but need methods to be able

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
to do so deliberately and efficiently in

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
order to be

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,400
successful uh whatever the size of the

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,400
program

47
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,118
before i begin to talk about the

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
approach that we're using

49
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,599
i did want to touch just briefly on one

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,959
of the traits that we're interested in a

51
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,399
little bit more in depth

52
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,039
because i'll be referencing it again

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,519
throughout the talk and so canopy height

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
is

55
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,759
simply the measurement between the soil

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,759
and the top of the longest

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,599
petiole and we're interested in this

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,359
because it's positively correlated with

59
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,840
weed competitiveness

60
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,520
weed competitiveness which is something

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,878
that's really important to a lot of our

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
growers many of whom

63
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,159
are organic um and spend a lot of time

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,719
and effort especially earlier in the

65
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,000
season

66
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,598
uh managing weeds in their field this is

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,560
a phenotype we're able to

68
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,519
easily measure uh so we have methods

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
both for whole

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
plot phenotype being in the field and

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,318
then using barcode

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,400
barcode rulers and scanners we can

73
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,119
quickly do single plant phenotyping in

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
the lab as well

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,159
and now i'm going to discuss a little

76
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,439
bit about our approach

77
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,878
and we so we're interested in

78
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,719
using genomic prediction and broadly

79
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
genomic assisted selection

80
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,080
in order to quickly identify useful

81
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,719
germplasm

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
from a collection while minimizing the

83
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,039
need for

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,879
extensive field screening and with this

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,239
work we're really drawing on two sources

86
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,039
of inspiration

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,599
the first is that of core collections

88
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,400
now

89
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,238
usually these were um and this was uh

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,719
these are methods used

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
um that have been used to reduce the

92
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,680
size of collections that need to be

93
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,318
screened in the field

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
um typically they've been based in

95
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,399
phenotypes

96
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,840
or passport information with the

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
increasing accessibility

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,560
of low-cost markers however many

99
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,318
germplasm curators

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
are able to genotype the entire

101
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,759
collections making them amenable to

102
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,359
things like genomic prediction uh over

103
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,598
the last five years or so there has been

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
an

105
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,839
increased interest in using genomic

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
prediction injury in pleasant

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,360
collections but most of these studies

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,759
have been based in simulations

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
so what we really want to do is directly

110
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,759
compare phenotypic and genomic assisted

111
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,280
selection by developing

112
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,120
breeding populations using different

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,318
methods and then

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,319
taking them into the field

115
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,719
so just really briefly one slide on the

116
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,318
prediction

117
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,239
models we're using these are kinship

118
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,798
based methods in which we're building

119
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,080
models

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,000
by regressing phenotypes on markers in

121
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
order to calculate reading values of

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,439
untested accessions

123
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,399
and here's our experimental design we

124
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,120
are comparing

125
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,638
three different selection strategies uh

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
two different flavors of genomic

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
assisted election

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,000
against phenotypic selection and then

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
for each of these we're taking five

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
highly ranked accessions for each

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
strategy trait combination you'll see

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
harsh flavors on the screen where

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
um i don't have time to talk about that

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,960
today

135
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,360
but it's another thing that we're really

136
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,879
interested in and each of these

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
accessions is being crossed to two

138
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,959
popular inbreds which can be thought of

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
as either biological replicates or kind

140
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,478
of like a tester

141
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,679
um and then these are progressed to f

142
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:00,959
the f2 generation

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,360
so the phenotypic selection is serving

144
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,560
as kind of our current standard approach

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,439
using data from hancock wisconsin

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
a couple years ago the first flavor of

147
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,959
the

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
genomic selection we're determining the

149
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,680
genomic reading values

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,360
strategy in which we're using available

151
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,759
reading program data to calculate

152
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,919
reading values for untested accessions

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,759
i know i'm kind of racing through these

154
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,758
i'm more than happy to talk more

155
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,038
in detail about these strategies later

156
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,439
in the chat

157
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,038
and then finally we are also working

158
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,079
with the genomic training population

159
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,360
strategy

160
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,879
and which were in which we identified a

161
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
genetically representative training

162
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,759
population

163
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
which we then phenotyped in our target

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
environment this one maximized the

165
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,680
relationship between the

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,360
test and the training population which

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,199
um

168
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
can dramatically increase predictive

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
accuracy of models but it did require an

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,919
extra year of phenotyping before

171
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,918
breeding could begin

172
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,600
next i'm going to talk about just some

173
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,279
of the results we've been able to

174
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,000
achieve so far

175
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,719
obviously the main thrust of this work

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,959
is going to be

177
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,759
the comparison of breeding populations

178
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,918
and

179
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,759
i'm really glad to report we just got

180
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,879
approval to actually have a field season

181
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
this year which wasn't

182
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,279
clear a few weeks ago so while we have

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,400
some pilot data we're going to be able

184
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,000
to dramatically

185
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,519
increase that next year by doing a

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
replicated trial of these breeding

187
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,599
populations and measuring them for the

188
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,879
traits we're interested in

189
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,080
as we were developing our genomic

190
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,839
training population strategy we also

191
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,000
uh were able to test different

192
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,719
parameters of the training population

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,120
uh using cross validation so what we

194
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
looked at was both composition and also

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,360
relative size

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,120
compared to the total collection which

197
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,038
is what you see here

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,598
and then finally and this has become

199
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,000
somewhat of a pet project of mine

200
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,598
uh we're beginning to analyze intra

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,879
accession diversity

202
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,639
so observationally we note a fair degree

203
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,680
of heterogeneity within a given

204
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
accession

205
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,400
and i think moving forward the success

206
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
of this type of approach is going to

207
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,279
rest not only on improving strategies to

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,120
exploit variation between accessions but

209
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,239
also

210
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,399
methods to quantify

211
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
and track diversity within accessions as

212
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,560
well

213
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
so in closing

214
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
we believe that genomic assisted

215
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,679
selection can help small programs

216
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,280
use genetic resources more effectively

217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,959
but what we're finding is that high

218
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,559
prediction accuracy

219
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,909
seems to require large training

220
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
populations

221
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,439
[Music]

222
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,919
but even moderate accuracy still may be

223
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,680
useful to programs who really just need

224
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,758
to reduce the number of accessions that

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,800
they're screening

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,479
and our future will work we'll

227
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,720
compare phenotypic and genotypic

228
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,399
selection in more detail

229
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
and we'll continue to track enter

230
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,478
accession diversity

231
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,439
with that um i'd like to thank people

232
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,120
who have

233
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,478
really been about invaluable to this

234
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,840
work um and i can take any questions

235
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,839
thank you

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
great thank you so much ko um i guess

237
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
we'll be

238
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
taking questions there's nothing in the

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
chat

240
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,840
so if you want to go ahead and raise

241
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
your hand and you can ask a question

242
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,879
uh looks like hannah uh hannah jeffrey

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,879
has a question

244
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,159
um you can go ahead and meet yourself

245
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,600
anna

246
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,879
thank you my question is about how

247
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
large do you think your training

248
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,120
populations will need to be in the

249
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,039
future

250
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
and what kind of statistical modeling

251
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,399
have you

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
implemented to try to predict what size

253
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,120
it will have to be

254
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,120
um

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
sure thank you for that question um

256
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,080
can you still hear me i'm not sure what

257
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,320
i'm looking at right now

258
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,120
um okay thank you yeah so

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
we saw a pretty dramatic improvement in

260
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,639
prediction accuracy

261
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
when we increased the size of our

262
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,319
training populations relative to the

263
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
total size of the collection

264
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
so i'm seeing another question here how

265
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,079
many germplasm do you work with

266
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,838
um and we were using about 470

267
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
cultivated accessions within the

268
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
germplasm collection

269
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,879
um and then the training population that

270
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,519
we phenotyped was 10

271
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,559
of that size which is consistent with

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,480
previous literature that looked at um

273
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,559
core collections that were roughly 10

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,039
the size of the total collection

275
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,000
and i think what's interesting is how

276
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,159
dramatically

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,679
accuracy did increase when we increased

278
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,719
the relative size so

279
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,120
jumping from 10 to 20 percent had

280
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,240
um had a large effect on prediction

281
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,278
accuracy

282
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,959
um and then so and then the second part

283
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,320
of your question is how

284
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,439
did we look at that um

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,640
that is correct yes yeah so

286
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,839
the one uh graph in the results section

287
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,278
that i showed

288
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,440
um showed how we so we had

289
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,439
a

290
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
data set of accessions for which we had

291
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,799
data for and we

292
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,040
used cross-validation to mask uh a

293
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,278
percentage of that that served as our

294
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,639
test population and then used

295
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,320
uh as the and then use the remaining as

296
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,399
the training population in order to

297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,720
predict the

298
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,200
the the test group and we were able to

299
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,639
do that many times with many different

300
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
training populations

301
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,838
of a given size calculated in the same

302
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,279
way

303
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,640
in order to discover that

304
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,480
in order to calculate the mean and

305
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:11,360
variance

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,800
of accuracy thank you very much

307
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,480
it's helpful for me as a as a student

308
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,679
sure yeah uh i guess you answered how

309
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
many germplasms so

310
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,039
uh mark sorrells would you like to

311
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
unmute yourself and ask for a question

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
yeah thanks for your talk um aren't your

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
phenotypes confounded by the percent

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:37,278
heterozygosity in individual plants

315
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:40,000
um the shorter answer is probably

316
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,039
uh right now we're working with single

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
genotypes

318
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,599
per accession and this is an outcrossing

319
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
species so there's

320
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,639
a degree of heterozygosity with

321
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,959
um within accessions and what i found

322
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
um with some preliminary analysis is

323
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,359
that that

324
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,480
level of heterozygosity also varies

325
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,839
across successions so i think uh future

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,278
work it's going to be really important

327
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,120
to follow up with some of that and

328
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,159
be able to account for a percent

329
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,959
heterogeneous heterozygosity

330
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,958
in our predictions

331
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,000
this has been a production of cornell
