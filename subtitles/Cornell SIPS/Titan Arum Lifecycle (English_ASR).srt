1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,599
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,240
University okay well this is a morois

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,160
titanum this is the Titan arum or the

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,320
corpse flower um it gets the name Titan

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,240
arum from Sir Attenborough on BBC

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,399
special because he thought it was

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:31,038
inappropriate to talk about aoral phace

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,280
in front of family and children so he

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,800
dubbed at the Titan arum what you're

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,320
looking at is the largest unbranched

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,359
inflorescence uh in the Botanical world

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,799
and by inflorescence we mean a stem that

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:50,479
bears uh more than one flower so uh this

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:54,000
is actually uh a a structure that's

15
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,558
called the spai and the spaic uh this is

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,439
the Spath which is a highly modified

17
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:02,878
leaf that wraps around the uh which

18
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,599
will eventually eventually be revealed

19
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:10,118
when this is ready to be pollinated um

20
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,319
the spedix is a central stem that bears

21
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,400
uh numerous little flowers and in this

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,158
particular case the flowers that are

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,719
going to produce seeds are at the bottom

24
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,600
and the flowers that produce pollen are

25
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:26,000
up towards the top so when this flower

26
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:29,239
is ready to be pollinated this Spath

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,118
will unfurl looking like a dress of a

28
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,039
ballerina except upside down on the

29
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:37,640
inside it'll be brilliantly red to

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,600
Maroon uh to mimic the appearance of

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,159
Rotting Flesh because in addition to

32
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:48,718
producing that appearance of Rotting

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,920
Flesh it also releases a very foul smell

34
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:55,078
that attracts flies and also many

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,320
believe carrying eating beetles so that

36
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,639
red inner surface of the space is

37
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,959
supposed to mimic uh a carcass of some

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,519
kind of animal and the fragrance is

39
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,799
supposed to mimic Rotting Flesh to

40
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:14,439
attract flies and carrying

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,360
beetles uh to my nose this particular

42
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,878
species the the fragrance if we want to

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,599
dignify it with that word smells like

44
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:26,639
rotting uh fish uh a related plant the

45
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,159
cojac amorphofalis

46
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,000
cojac uh which is figured over there is

47
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:36,519
reported to smell like rotting mouse or

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
rat so each of the species actually has

49
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,280
its own fragrance and there's two at

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,759
least that are very pleasant in their

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,560
fragrance one smells like uh chopped

52
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,359
carrot and the other smells a little bit

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,920
like banana but we we are in front of

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,319
the corpse flower so that's the

55
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,119
reproductive aspect of the plant what is

56
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,560
hidden is the underground working part

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,360
from year to year year and that's the

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,519
corn so this is what the underground

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,040
part of the plant looks like uh

60
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:14,080
technically this is called a COR which

61
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:16,439
is a highly modified stem uh the INF

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,120
fluoresence the collection of flowers

63
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,799
with the Spath and spaic emerges from

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,239
the center of the Corn and in fact if

65
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,280
you look in here there's a very good

66
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,438
indication that this corn may be ready

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:36,080
to produce its own flour

68
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:40,438
so after the flower flowers open up and

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,519
are pollinated and produce seed uh the

70
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:47,120
entire infloresence Withers uh and uh

71
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,640
breaks apart after the fruits and seeds

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,759
are dispersed and this corn will send up

73
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,759
the vegetative parts of the plant the

74
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,878
plants that are photosynthetic uh these

75
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:03,399
are one or more leaves

76
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,798
so these are these are the babies of we

77
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,640
stinky that we collected uh 2 to 3 years

78
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,719
ago and thanks to the wonderful staff

79
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:16,918
here uh uh like Paul Cooper who have

80
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,519
kept these plants happy and growing well

81
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,359
uh we now have additional specimens and

82
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,040
this is what a leaf of the Titan arum

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,960
will look like this is uh not a stem

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,199
it's the base of a single leaf uh that

85
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,319
is then divided into three and they're

86
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,560
extremely decorative and extremely

87
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,560
beautiful plants I

88
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:41,478
think and then what will happen is

89
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,680
eventually these leaves will exhaust

90
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:47,240
themselves they'll become dormant and

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,639
the cor will rest for a while for uh an

92
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,960
unprescribed uh number of months uh and

93
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,879
then the cycle will be repeated over and

94
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,560
over again with some

95
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:02,000
luck I think it's it's U you know people

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,160
people like Paul Cooper who have done

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,839
such a brilliant job keeping these

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,439
plants happy that the same specimen is

99
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:13,959
actually flowering in less than 3 years

100
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,120
it's very unusual to have a corn uh

101
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,680
produce an inflorescence over such a

102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,478
short time usually there's a resting

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,439
period of maybe five six and in some

104
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,959
cases as much as 11

105
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,719
years so after

106
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:34,198
pollination uh the space at outer skirt

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,080
of modified Leaf will wither and the

108
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,840
pollen producing flowers which are up

109
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,839
towards the top will also wither but

110
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,918
then what will happen is the individual

111
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,959
flowers the female plants uh each of

112
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,560
them will develop an individual fruit

113
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,719
and each of these now is the fruit of a

114
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,639
single flower uh the bright red is

115
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
believed to attract birds like horn

116
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,759
Bells which uh are

117
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:07,839
common in Indonesia sumantra and the

118
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,120
birds will uh it's believed uh disperse

119
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,119
these seeds they'll eat the outer fleshy

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,560
part of the of the fruit and the inner

121
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,399
part of the fruit is like a nut and

122
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,800
inside that nut is the actual seed and

123
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,000
that passes through the birds and that's

124
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,598
the way these plants get dispersed uh in

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,598
their native

126
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,519
environment
