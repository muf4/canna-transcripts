1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,839
University

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,150
so thank you for the invitation to come

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:15,250
down and speak it's a beautiful sunny

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,600
day in Ithaca so I'll try to talk

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,899
fasting and get back out there in the

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,439
sunshine so this is my title um you know

8
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:24,939
I work for a company that develops

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,429
biological seed treatments and what I

10
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:28,929
mean by that is fungi and bacteria that

11
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:30,338
you can coat the seed with plant it in

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,549
the ground in the ground and they affect

13
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:34,600
plant performance and the main fungal

14
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,429
species that we're working with this

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,480
Trichoderma that's what our existing

16
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:42,460
products are and and this Fido biomes

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,099
microbiome approach to research is

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,140
something that is really important in

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,750
what we do because if you think about it

20
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:55,450
what we are leveraging is the fighter

21
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:57,219
biome in our technology so this is a

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,430
brief outline of my talk and I realize

23
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:02,350
looking at this that I'm only going to

24
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:04,359
partially follow this thing's are a

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,320
little out of order but you'll figure it

26
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,239
out so before I jump right into things

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,038
there are a couple things I want to talk

28
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,530
about to the students and postdocs in

29
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,890
the room and the first thing is careers

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,689
and so you all may think that you know

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,519
exactly what you want to do but it's

32
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:23,258
really rare that you take that straight

33
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,298
line path and you end up doing what you

34
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,468
think you're going to do so I never

35
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,759
thought I would be the chief science

36
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:33,998
officer and a company and my main

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,060
messages think creatively and broadly

38
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:40,438
about what your career options are and

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:45,210
the other thing I would say is that

40
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:48,218
dollars are rare are few and far between

41
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,688
regardless of the of the sector of

42
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:53,228
science that you're in academics

43
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:54,309
industry government anywhere you go

44
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:56,048
you're going to be operating on a

45
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,850
shoestring unless you're working in the

46
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,530
plant breeding program in Monsanto or

47
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,468
you can afford to put out five hundred

48
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,920
thousand plots every year so just keep

49
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:07,718
that in mind okay the next thing I want

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,179
to mention is about communicating

51
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,680
science this is something that I'm very

52
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,629
passionate about I think that everyone

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,250
here should think about because you have

54
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,620
a lot to communicate about you've a lot

55
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,688
to think about in your careers doing

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,719
science and one of them should be how

57
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:24,889
you talk about your sign

58
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,629
it's okay scientists until fairly

59
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,969
recently used to be in a position of

60
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,280
authority that we were seen as experts

61
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,449
in the field and we worked with facts

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,490
and things like this

63
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:41,389
and so so there's been a change okay so

64
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,860
we need to think about how to speak

65
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:45,019
about science and how to communicate

66
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,760
that to the general public so these are

67
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,080
just some notes that I have if you don't

68
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,280
know how to speak about science if

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,570
you're not a good speaker figure out how

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
to do that right that's going to be

71
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,370
really important you need to be able to

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,680
communicate science not everyone is

73
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,310
gonna argue like a scientist does right

74
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,409
we work with facts we have discourse but

75
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,060
that's not how everyone does it and the

76
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:08,289
other part about this is is don't just

77
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,759
talk to scientists okay we can publish

78
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:14,299
in peer reviewed journals we can have

79
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,429
really nice conversations at meeting

80
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,689
scientific meetings that we go to but

81
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,490
there are other people out there that

82
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:20,870
you need to be talking to and there

83
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,240
they're non scientists who are talking

84
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,680
about science right the bloggers for

85
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,810
example are going to go into that peer

86
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,760
reviewed literature as well and mine it

87
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,930
for what they're interested in so we

88
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,280
need to learn how to talk to these

89
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,080
people and and and and figure out how to

90
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,509
be part of the conversation

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,130
and so this is what I'm talking about

92
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,620
just a note about you know bloggers and

93
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,979
things like this people will question

94
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,989
your motivations right that's the whole

95
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,459
goal of some people when they question

96
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,019
science is why did you do this research

97
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,640
and who's funding it okay

98
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,590
so these are the things we need to be

99
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,449
thinking about you may rationalize why

100
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,890
you're doing research on a scientific

101
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,810
level but other people are going to find

102
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,729
other reasons and so this I just want to

103
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,229
bring up these points as things we need

104
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,409
to be thinking about as future

105
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:08,060
scientists okay the rest of this should

106
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,650
be fairly obviously think creatively

107
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,180
about how you make yourself heard I

108
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,620
don't know what the answer to this is

109
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm not good at Twitter I can't even

110
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,780
figure out how to send a tweet that's

111
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,569
just my generation I suppose listen to

112
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,209
what people are seeing saying and teach

113
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:26,180
as often as you can okay

114
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:28,759
moving on I work for a company called

115
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,280
advanced biological marketing we are

116
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,639
based in Van Wert Ohio and the company

117
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:39,709
was founded in the year 2000

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,139
our D lab is located in Geneva pictured

119
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:45,288
here probably the day after we moved in

120
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,218
notice how nice and clean it is it looks

121
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:49,699
nothing like that right now

122
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:51,680
so Gary Harmon who was faculty at

123
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,778
Cornell up in Geneva for 40-plus years

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,269
was our first chief science officer he

125
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:57,620
has since retired and Gary Bergstrom

126
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:02,060
asked me what does that mean well he's

127
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:05,468
starting another LLC so um so anyway

128
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,939
that this is this is where I work and

129
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:11,060
this is what advanced biological

130
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:13,849
marketing does discovery development

131
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,009
production and sales of microbial seed

132
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:17,959
treatments these microbial seed

133
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,449
treatments are generally referred to in

134
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,818
the industry as biological so when I

135
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,650
refer to biologicals to a scientist that

136
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,860
means a lot of different things in my

137
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:30,888
industry it means these living seed or

138
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,468
other types of applications we're

139
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:36,348
working primarily with trichoderma but

140
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:38,478
also bacillus and rhizobia because we

141
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:42,699
have products for lots of different

142
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:46,128
legume crops what we are selling our

143
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:47,990
spores and in the case of more fragile

144
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:51,050
organisms like the gram negatives we're

145
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,848
selling encapsulated cells and this is

146
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,379
an important thing because what we do is

147
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:58,699
we sell a product that is put on the

148
00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:00,879
seed might be combined with agricultural

149
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,460
chemicals like fungicides insecticides

150
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,870
things like this and so and so what

151
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:08,568
we're actually selling is an important

152
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,579
thing to think about and how these are

153
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,199
used while they're used by the farmer

154
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,310
all the way up to a commercial seed

155
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,949
treater in a lot of different

156
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,959
environments and I put this picture in

157
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,899
just to show some of the differences and

158
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,478
I'll show you more than just this but

159
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,199
this was actually a field trial that was

160
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:29,209
done this year in a drought situation

161
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,399
where this you can kind of see these

162
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:32,930
strips and this is typical of some of

163
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,500
the kinds of data that we collect so a

164
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,418
strip trial where this very green strip

165
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,370
was the control standard chemical

166
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:45,198
treatment and it was not tasseled yet

167
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,759
and these are a couple of biological

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,040
treatments our treatment actually one

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,839
this particular trial and you can see

170
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,810
some of the differences here in the

171
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,159
different corn and different cobs these

172
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,990
from the standard chemical treatment

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,030
didn't oh I guess I have a pointer sorry

174
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:06,090
um so not that you can see it okay so on

175
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:07,769
your left our cobs that didn't fill now

176
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,899
they're slower maturing as you can tell

177
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,209
by the lighter color and then those on

178
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,579
the right were our product which is

179
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:17,099
called say bricks and that contains two

180
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,109
different strains of Trichoderma and it

181
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,110
is matured at this point in the season

182
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,370
and it filled much better again it

183
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,100
didn't feel completely because I said

184
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,129
this was under severe drought stress so

185
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,640
that's a little bit about the company

186
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:36,899
and what we do but there are a lot of

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,169
other players in this game so this is

188
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:44,029
kind of different pedigrees of the

189
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:47,879
companies that are also in seed egg

190
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:50,519
chemicals and now biologicals and this

191
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,990
was fairly accurate until about a month

192
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:59,519
ago because maybe I'll use this as a

193
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:02,579
pointer so bear is now in the process of

194
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:06,029
acquiring Monsanto so if that goes

195
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:08,909
through that's that's a big deal and Dow

196
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:12,209
has I think finalized their merger with

197
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,590
DuPont so now oh and Syngenta is no

198
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:16,859
longer dissing gender that's actually

199
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:20,279
owned by a Chinese company called Kim

200
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:24,150
China so so they're now actually just

201
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,959
four players BSF BASF in contrast looks

202
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,539
pretty small

203
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,149
I'm relative to these others so and and

204
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,009
so ABM plays in the same area right

205
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,840
we're we're producing these these

206
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:36,090
biologicals and all of these companies

207
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,910
are as well so we're a teeny tiny fish

208
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:44,460
playing in that pond with some quite

209
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:48,659
large fish okay so what our biologicals

210
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:51,030
as i said it's this general term you

211
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,799
know there it started out its biological

212
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:56,089
control the use of one organism to limit

213
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,990
the activity of another and we think

214
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,019
when you look in the literature most

215
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,379
biological control is thinking about

216
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,728
insects

217
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:09,028
to control insects but we're using fungi

218
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:14,278
and bacteria as seed treatments and we

219
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:16,918
can control insects nematodes fungal and

220
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,928
bacterial pathogens there are several

221
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:21,139
models about how this might work and

222
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:23,639
I'll get to that in just a moment and

223
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:25,288
this has obvious potential for

224
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,109
agriculture right if you just think

225
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:29,879
about Disease Control well that's one

226
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,109
thing that that obviously I'm speaking

227
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,729
to the plant pathology department we

228
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:35,129
want to control disease but there are a

229
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:37,259
lot of other things that happen to the

230
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,259
the thing that you can get with most any

231
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,528
biological is growth promotion right you

232
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:48,389
see plants grow bigger they often look

233
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:50,970
greener because the genes involved in

234
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:55,589
photosynthesis are upregulated we see

235
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:57,479
increased yields and so that benefit is

236
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,899
fairly obvious and so then if you can

237
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:04,109
apply a safe biological product to the

238
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:06,448
seed or even as a foliar spray or or

239
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:08,189
along with the fertilizer maybe you can

240
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:11,399
reduce the need for agricultural

241
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:13,288
chemicals which should be good which in

242
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,538
turn should lead to healthier and safer

243
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:22,308
agricultural systems more sustainable

244
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:24,028
agricultural systems right so

245
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:25,798
biologicals have been around a

246
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:26,698
biological control has been around for

247
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:29,249
quite some time

248
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:31,498
the first regicide registered fungal bio

249
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:34,678
control was t22 and that was done by

250
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:38,970
gary harmon in 1990 was when it was

251
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:41,188
registered it had clear demonstrations

252
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,109
of this performance enhancement in the

253
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:49,918
field and disease control in the field

254
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:50,970
and but but some of the people are there

255
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:54,359
are a lot of products that were

256
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,399
developed at that time and since for bio

257
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:59,278
control and as biologicals

258
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,578
and sometimes this whole industry was

259
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:05,119
its own worst enemy because there wasn't

260
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,168
a lot of data it was poorly understood

261
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:09,449
people were brewing these things in

262
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:12,658
their mom's basement and selling dirty

263
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:13,579
water right so so there's there's a lot

264
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,620
that have

265
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,410
in the early days that is still biting

266
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,450
us in the butt now right so hopefully

267
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:23,149
I'll show you how we weave we're moving

268
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,740
beyond that but there are several

269
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,809
control mechanisms that were

270
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,110
hypothesized at that time and and from

271
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:32,179
your intro a path course that hopefully

272
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,129
you you know some of these antibiotics

273
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,019
you know we're an an organism might

274
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:38,509
produce a chemical or metabolites that

275
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:41,389
that is toxic or inhibitory to another

276
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,980
organism this replacement where

277
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,019
something really one organism

278
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:51,920
outcompetes another and a direct

279
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:53,899
antagonism which where an organism might

280
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,079
actually kill another organism not

281
00:11:53,899 --> 00:12:00,049
necessarily through an antibiotic and

282
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,730
then performance enhancement mechanisms

283
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:04,309
there are several those and one of the

284
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:08,659
main mechanisms that hypothesized is is

285
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:13,189
nutrient mobilization or bioavailability

286
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:16,490
and and also through growth promotion

287
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,280
you get with that in increased surface

288
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,870
area which has obvious benefits in terms

289
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,899
of water and nutrient uptake so so so

290
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,299
this is kind of where we started but the

291
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:32,240
problem was the field performance has

292
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:34,159
been highly variable there's no question

293
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,870
about that and as I said some of that

294
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,779
came to do with how some of these

295
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,389
products were developed and produced in

296
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:46,389
the early days and that's what everyone

297
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:49,370
in this field is trying to overcome so

298
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:52,850
moving on and what we know now is is

299
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,679
that the mechanisms do include for

300
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,840
disease control do include this niche

301
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,389
replacement antibiotics and Michael

302
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,450
parasitism but also there have been a

303
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,129
lot of studies from dr. Hartman's lab as

304
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,320
well as many others around the world

305
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,750
showing that there are many genes that

306
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,520
are actually turned on when the plant is

307
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,950
colonized by some of these biological

308
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,250
agents and and so we get an induced

309
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:23,780
systemic resistance of many different

310
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:25,759
flavors abiotic stress resistance we see

311
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,509
that the changes in plant gene

312
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,409
expression

313
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:32,779
due to this colonization have a really

314
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:35,689
big effect on reactive oxygen cycling

315
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,309
that is reactive oxygen species have

316
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,620
some you know our stress molecules and

317
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:42,979
and when the roots are colonized by

318
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,720
Trichoderma specifically the the genes

319
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,550
in this cycling pathway are upregulated

320
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,529
and so the plant is better able to

321
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:52,609
buffer stress to protect itself against

322
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:56,059
stress and and protect its its proteins

323
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,360
and and cell structure so a growth

324
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:02,359
promotion bio stimulation we know that

325
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,149
yes soil nutrient availability is

326
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,759
important here but we also see that the

327
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,029
changes in plant gene expression up

328
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,529
regulate carbon metabolism and

329
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:16,819
photosynthesis so we're seeing here is

330
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:19,220
is the the hypotheses from the early

331
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,290
days weren't wrong but there's more to

332
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,790
it than that that that the organisms are

333
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:28,639
actually directly affecting how the

334
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:30,769
plant is expressing its own genes ok ok

335
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,220
so I just want to give a few examples

336
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:37,250
just in pictures here of some of these

337
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,070
some of the effects and so this is an

338
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:43,429
experiment that we do in the greenhouse

339
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,170
and for Disease Control just one of many

340
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:47,719
different types because obviously we can

341
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:50,120
test for anti-bias on a plate or in the

342
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,889
lab but but what we care most about is

343
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,679
testing these things in the soil and

344
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,600
better yet in the field ok so this is a

345
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,959
greenhouse experiment and what we've

346
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,570
done here is we've infested the soil to

347
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,870
an ld50 so that is if we with

348
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,600
Rhizoctonia and so if we plant 10 wheat

349
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:12,230
seeds in there we expect to kill 5 of

350
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,060
them ok but that's the SA and so we've

351
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,769
done a good job of that right here we've

352
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:22,789
got the control and there's the control

353
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:24,740
and all of these all of the rest of

354
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,029
these were treated with the standard

355
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,070
chemical treatment and what that

356
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:32,720
standard chemical treatment is a mixture

357
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,920
of fungicides and insecticides and it

358
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,750
just depends on who you buy it from us

359
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,129
exactly what those are so here's a

360
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,528
standard chemical treatment and you see

361
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:41,208
that that it's got

362
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:43,850
it actually has three fungicides in it

363
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:47,328
and it's controlling the Rhizoctonia

364
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,749
better than the control but you when you

365
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:53,179
throw Trichoderma in that mix then you

366
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,778
see either with the chemical standard

367
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:59,328
chemical treatment or Trichoderma alone

368
00:15:55,778 --> 00:16:01,669
we see a really big improvement in fact

369
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:07,068
we have 100 percent germination in the

370
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:11,058
in the Trichoderma shown here so so

371
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:13,578
that's one way we do this Si and you

372
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:15,139
might say oh but you put a fungicide on

373
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:18,409
the seeds how is strike a dermo which is

374
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,720
a fungus fungus able to grow well

375
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,639
trichoderma first of all we put on

376
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,350
spores which are very resistant and the

377
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,180
other thing is is trichoderma sexually

378
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,389
broadly resistant when two fungicides

379
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:35,088
which is one of the key reasons why we

380
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:38,528
use it okay so that's a disease test so

381
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:43,339
looking at abiotic stress tolerance

382
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:45,919
these are some plants that have that

383
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,459
we've either applied a water deficit to

384
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,740
when we did that just by determining

385
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:54,409
what the the 100% water holding capacity

386
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,079
was on that pot weighed it and then

387
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:59,600
water to 60% of that level and that's

388
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,568
our water stress salt stresses were

389
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,849
watering with a salt solution and the

390
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:06,678
plants on the Left were did not have

391
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,188
trichoderma on them and the plants on

392
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,169
the right do have Trichoderma so these

393
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,699
pictures I know it's just one plant but

394
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:16,780
it's a demonstration of the kinds of

395
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,579
kind of effect that you can see here and

396
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:24,798
as I said earlier we want this to be

397
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:26,209
able to translate to the field and so we

398
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,240
do a lot of work in the greenhouse but

399
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,919
as fast as we can we move our pipeline

400
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,279
products out to the field so we can get

401
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:37,700
some some real-world data on them and so

402
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,918
the this was an entire field that was

403
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,710
split down the middle half was planted

404
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,320
with no Trichoderma the other half was

405
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,720
planted with Trichoderma which is in

406
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,839
this case was our say bricks for corn

407
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,089
product carrying two trichoderma strains

408
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:57,918
that treatment was made at the time of

409
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:59,629
planting and both of these were also

410
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,370
coated with the standard chemical

411
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,440
treatment okay so they either received

412
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:05,418
the same base treatment the plants on

413
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,460
the right received our saber extra corn

414
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,590
Trichoderma this is at the end of the

415
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,380
season Illinois in 2012 there was a

416
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:15,528
severe drought and so you can see the

417
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:19,570
result the Trichoderma enabled the

418
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:22,730
plants on the right to continue to live

419
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:26,450
to produce a yield which you can see in

420
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,179
the in the cobs below it wasn't perfect

421
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,909
ear filling down here but it was far

422
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,980
better than the untreated plants on the

423
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:36,140
left okay the plants on the Left we

424
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,250
don't have yield data on or what the

425
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,809
yield improvement was on this because

426
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:45,079
the material on the left was not

427
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:46,609
harvested it was just too poor so okay

428
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,609
and then finally looking at growth

429
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:51,829
promotion as I said this is the trait

430
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:54,798
that is most commonly affected by a

431
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:56,658
biological product it may or may not

432
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,269
control disease and may or may not

433
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:01,760
improve abiotic stress but it will it

434
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:07,908
will like 95 percent the time give you a

435
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:09,319
bigger plant and so we can we have we

436
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:11,330
have a saber x product here for rice and

437
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,879
so this is showing standard chemical

438
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:15,109
treatment alone on the left and say

439
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,230
breaks for rice over that standard

440
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:20,449
chemical control and you can see the the

441
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,308
larger root mass there and these are the

442
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,230
same number of plants in each pile there

443
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:26,058
I tell you this is the kind of data I

444
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,429
received sometimes from the field guys

445
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:33,648
so it's not always the best this was a

446
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:35,690
pretty good representation so the corn

447
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:37,729
in the middle we're looking at the

448
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,110
control plant on the left so everything

449
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,210
again everything received the standard

450
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:44,449
chemical treatment the Saybrook for corn

451
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,100
is in the middle and the k5 as2 on the

452
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,429
right is one of our pipeline products

453
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:51,980
which is bigger still and these again

454
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:55,580
are shown in the in the roots on the

455
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,038
right here we have talked a lot about

456
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,759
you know at ABM we talked a lot about

457
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:03,829
improvements in route biomass but that's

458
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,700
a really hard thing to measure unless

459
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,949
you have a rice

460
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,259
so we made up our owner at the time

461
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,240
right Sean and that is a seven foot PVC

462
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:13,849
pipe that we put into the ground and we

463
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,569
fill with soil and so that's what we did

464
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:18,500
with these and we treated them with our

465
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:20,210
with our treatments the standard

466
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,910
chemical treatment plus the treatments

467
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,960
that are listed up there on the top and

468
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,100
let them grow through the season and

469
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,049
then pulled those tubes out of the

470
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:32,599
ground and washed away the soil and so

471
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:34,990
what is shown here is the control say

472
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:41,929
bricks and then to pipeline products

473
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:45,410
with a much bigger root mass and so k5

474
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:47,690
as2 the pipeline product and then omega

475
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,630
which interestingly contains no living

476
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,570
biological contains only a metabolite or

477
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:57,230
signaling molecule from trichoderma that

478
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:58,849
is formulated here so so this is really

479
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,589
interesting because again we harvested

480
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:02,149
this at the end of the season and so

481
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:05,029
what we got here was a season-long

482
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:09,350
effect that's something we're still

483
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:10,490
working out how that's happening so so

484
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:13,609
anyway so these are some of the growth

485
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,579
promotion data and and and they're just

486
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:17,990
examples you know this you know wasn't

487
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:19,460
quantitative data I just want to give

488
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,160
you the idea because you're probably not

489
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,710
used to looking at these kinds of things

490
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,440
okay let's move on now because I've been

491
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,269
talking about our products which are

492
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,750
products in our pipeline products which

493
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:34,700
are two strains sometimes more but you

494
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,799
know usually that the sweet spot is is

495
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,120
two to four organisms in there so I told

496
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,519
you I talked about the phyto biome so

497
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,439
why do we care about the phyto biome

498
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,629
well there are a lot of reasons why we

499
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,740
might care about this first of all I'm

500
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,790
telling you that we're putting a

501
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,670
biological product we're putting

502
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:57,769
biological organisms on the seed into

503
00:21:52,670 --> 00:22:01,850
the soil okay so so we know that a corn

504
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:03,639
plant for example you know it's got into

505
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:06,740
fights living in it it's gonna have

506
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,150
organisms on the leaf tissue as well

507
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,480
write some of these are causing disease

508
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,660
some are not the soil is teeming with

509
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,549
life and we're putting on another living

510
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,538
organism onto the seat

511
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:19,548
why

512
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:20,898
we care about the phyto biome right this

513
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:23,479
is actually what we're doing and what

514
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:25,038
we're leveraging in our products it's

515
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:26,538
just we didn't know it till about five

516
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,329
years ago because I didn't have a name

517
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:32,419
okay but one of the things that that

518
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:34,728
that we think about all the time is what

519
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:37,729
are we recruiting to the seed when we

520
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:40,759
put our biological there okay and and so

521
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:44,690
this is this is all in the realm of Fido

522
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:47,389
biome and I just want to give a plug

523
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,070
here that that ApS our professional

524
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:51,648
society is very heavily involved in

525
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:53,509
fighting biomes and if you want to learn

526
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,939
more about it if you're not fully into

527
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:58,460
that then then you can learn more here

528
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:05,119
find the roadmap that's been put

529
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:06,108
together so okay you've probably seen

530
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:09,439
slides like this before

531
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:13,128
I just went to web of science and looked

532
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,460
how many times has the term microbiome

533
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:19,098
or Fido biome been been used over time

534
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,098
and so there's been a real a massive

535
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:27,108
increase actually since you know 2008

536
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:29,358
2009 and that's not to say people

537
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:31,398
weren't thinking about this before then

538
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:33,739
but I think what's happened is that

539
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:37,459
sequencing and informatics techniques

540
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:40,608
have really come along like we can

541
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,069
acquire so much sequence now we can you

542
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:45,048
know you know back in the day people and

543
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:46,668
I sorry I said back in the day but you

544
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,918
know a long time ago you know people

545
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,720
were doing PCR on dirt and they're like

546
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,950
why are you doing PCR on dirt you know

547
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,389
what are gonna get out of that well this

548
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,090
is what we can get out of that right we

549
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:58,178
can we can now look at this with a

550
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,528
luminous sequence or some other kind of

551
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:02,570
sequencing technologies and we can

552
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:05,960
actually figure out a lot about what's

553
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:07,249
there so so there's been a real boom

554
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,220
here and a lot of this has been in

555
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:13,159
medicine but more and more is is in the

556
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,759
plant world and so so this is something

557
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,039
that's changing along with this along

558
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,440
with the the scientific discoveries in

559
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,019
the Illumina I sorry the sequencing and

560
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,230
bioinformatics that have been on the

561
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:29,989
rise there's been explosion in a

562
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,990
biological companies ABM has been

563
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:34,380
working in this area

564
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:38,220
since 2000 right and these are the

565
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,450
companies and I know I I'm sure I'm

566
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,558
saying a lot actually these are just

567
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,590
some ones I can think of the other day

568
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,750
so all right told you about the sorry

569
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:49,470
the big players in the field Monsanto

570
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:55,169
and bear now on pioneer Dow I mean

571
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,339
DuPont Dow are now one but there's also

572
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,690
so those are the ones who have been

573
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:59,129
around for a while and our traditional

574
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,659
chemical companies and plant breeding

575
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:05,909
companies that are now in in biologicals

576
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,860
the ones in blue are also companies that

577
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:09,179
are a little bit older they're kind of

578
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,369
on the fringe is kind of second year

579
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,600
chemical second-tier chemical companies

580
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:14,879
or breeding companies that are also

581
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,038
playing in this field and then all of

582
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,299
those are that are in green and these

583
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,058
are the ones I know that there are many

584
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:24,000
more of our the companies that have been

585
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:27,558
started or started working in

586
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,079
biologicals in the last five years

587
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:34,980
specifically to leverage phyto biome and

588
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:37,398
microbiome data okay that so that's all

589
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,110
new so again this this is showing you

590
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:45,778
kind of the marketer that the space that

591
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:47,939
that ABM is operating in so every one of

592
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:50,819
these companies is trying to address

593
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,149
something that's the fundamental problem

594
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:56,069
in agriculture but agriculture suffers

595
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:59,219
from the effects of environmental

596
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,990
variability right there's no question

597
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,419
about this that's why we do breeding

598
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,259
that's why we do trialing all over the

599
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,970
country and a lot of different

600
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,859
environments we're trying to address

601
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,990
this problem because if we could get 300

602
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,398
bushel corn every single year everywhere

603
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,980
we planted well that's done and I'd be

604
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:16,168
out of a job okay but that's not how it

605
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,778
is there's there's a lot of

606
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:22,559
environmental variability and this is a

607
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:24,509
plot of some of our data I think just

608
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,839
from last year is showing yields on the

609
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:31,859
y-axis and location on the right there

610
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,538
are probably about five corn hybrids

611
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,569
that are in this so it's not all one

612
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:39,839
genotype of the host but it's showing

613
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:41,939
you that that yields vary by location

614
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,339
and there's no question about that and

615
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,230
what's in blue here

616
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,470
our saber extra corn product again at

617
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:51,900
Trichoderma product it's increased over

618
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,870
the control or under the control as a

619
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,080
case may be for down there on the on the

620
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:00,658
left down here but what this shows very

621
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,808
clearly is that there's no relationship

622
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:09,750
between the performance of a biological

623
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:14,519
and the yield of a corn plant or even

624
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:17,940
the location and and so why is that you

625
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,558
know these are this is a question what

626
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,019
is that i don't have the answer right

627
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,119
and so it's one of the things that we

628
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:26,099
are working on trying to solve and so is

629
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,629
everyone else that i showed on that last

630
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:33,178
slide everyone is working on this so

631
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,620
okay getting back up phyto biomes can

632
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,509
some of this field level variability to

633
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,969
be explained by its interaction with the

634
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:40,798
phyto biome there are a lot of factors

635
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,778
out there but we need to think about

636
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,558
what the factors are that we can control

637
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:49,740
and understand okay

638
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:52,139
yeah AG biologicals interact with prices

639
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,149
fear and soil inhabitants the plant in a

640
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,909
sphere and the file's fear like oh this

641
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:59,489
is this is where that corn plant has to

642
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,649
live or whatever whatever crop that you

643
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,450
work on our species that's what it has

644
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:05,278
to live with and this is an equation

645
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,340
that everyone in here should know and if

646
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,589
you don't then then you should come to

647
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:12,028
love this because you know you can get a

648
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,408
lot of mileage out of this right so

649
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:15,179
phenotype right that's disease

650
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:17,880
resistance that's yield less stress

651
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:21,679
tolerance genotype we think about us

652
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,899
being the plant right the host crop

653
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,409
environment where you plant it what

654
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:30,528
chemicals did you apply to it you know

655
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:34,620
how much rain did you get that year and

656
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:37,230
then the other part the G by E how does

657
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,058
the how do the the genetics of that host

658
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,019
interact with the environment because

659
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:44,730
that can if this Therma is really big

660
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,929
then you need to go back to to doing

661
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,028
some breeding and rethinking this

662
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:49,350
because this is the part that we really

663
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:53,099
want to control that genetic by

664
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:55,589
environmental interaction okay so this

665
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,730
is the rest of the slide because what I

666
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:58,029
want to talk about is what can we

667
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,430
control here what can

668
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:02,289
what can't we control so there's

669
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,519
phenotype right I already talked about

670
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,319
that that's the trait that's what we're

671
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,359
interested in the plant looking like at

672
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,609
the end of the season genotype we've

673
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,439
thought of as being the host well

674
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:13,179
there's another genotype here that

675
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,549
people are starting to add and that's

676
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,060
the the biological product the microbial

677
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:21,879
right

678
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:24,369
and so Monsanto you know pioneer all

679
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,350
these companies ABM all of us who are

680
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,419
developing microbes we all have the

681
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:31,779
genome sequence sequences of Australians

682
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:35,380
we know what what the genotypes are and

683
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:37,839
so what a lot of research is aimed at is

684
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,300
how does that microbe interact with the

685
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:43,419
host plant where the phyto biome

686
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:46,839
research comes into is how does this

687
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:49,390
interaction relate to this interaction

688
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,250
right because all of this on the end

689
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,630
here that's the environment I already

690
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,160
talked about whether there's no

691
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,380
controlling the weather management

692
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,390
practices you may think you control

693
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,370
management practices but when you send

694
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,050
your material out to a contract

695
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:04,059
researcher and you say I would like you

696
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,259
to apply 200 pounds of nitrogen and they

697
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,389
apply three and they'll tell you about

698
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:11,109
it well that's something that you know

699
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:13,000
it's hard to control and and so and so

700
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,289
you can make recommendations but in the

701
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,430
end the farmer is going to do what the

702
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:17,859
farmer is going to do because they know

703
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,700
their own farm the best soil type an

704
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:21,939
environment can't control that

705
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,309
rhizosphere

706
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,269
biology what's in the bulk soil wasn't

707
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:27,460
that rhizosphere

708
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:30,190
right and I put this with this kind of

709
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,769
green and yellow dot here is because I

710
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,720
think we're we could be going with the

711
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,759
spider biome research is gaining some

712
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,370
control or at least understanding of

713
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:40,720
what is in the rhizosphere right the

714
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:42,849
rhizosphere is going to be different

715
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,660
from what's in the bulk soil and so if

716
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:49,679
you put a biological on the seed and its

717
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,970
recruiting something or having an

718
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,850
antibiotic effect or something it's

719
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:58,059
changing what would otherwise be in that

720
00:30:54,849 --> 00:31:00,879
rhizosphere right that's the idea can we

721
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,200
make this a predictable relationship all

722
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,580
right that's where all this is going and

723
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,420
that's what everyone is doing who's

724
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:10,439
playing in this field

725
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,730
all right then moving on about how we do

726
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,350
that and this is the part where my talk

727
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,400
doesn't really follow the outline that I

728
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:23,009
put put up in the beginning so so how we

729
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:25,110
develop strains we're a small company

730
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:27,660
they're about 40 employees in ABM so we

731
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:29,429
need to use our resources wisely this is

732
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,720
a correlation matrix among a lot of

733
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,090
different traits that I have assayed for

734
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,759
in the greenhouse or in the lab or in

735
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:37,559
field trials with with a large set of

736
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,710
our strain collection and that's

737
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,740
Trichoderma and and bacillus okay so

738
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:47,009
what we want to see is if I can develop

739
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:49,079
assays that are essentially markers for

740
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:50,490
good performance okay I don't want to

741
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,409
have to do every single one of these

742
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,009
tests every single time I develop a

743
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,200
trait I want to be able to do a few of

744
00:31:56,009 --> 00:32:02,910
these assays and have that translate to

745
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,590
the field so that's how we do our well

746
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,060
the beginnings of our strange selection

747
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,059
then once everything gets out into the

748
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:12,149
field for field trials well all bets can

749
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:13,139
be off sometimes so so anyway the point

750
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,140
is there are a lot of different

751
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:20,040
phenotypes that go into a good strain

752
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,290
and this varies at a strain level not at

753
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:26,940
a species level I'm sure that that you

754
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:28,589
know you all are aware of that and this

755
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,000
correlation of phenotypic effects is

756
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,589
what's going to get us our high

757
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,349
influenced strains and those are the

758
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:36,480
ones that we advance through our process

759
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:38,099
so that's just to give you an idea of

760
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,380
what we're looking at we're looking at

761
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:44,939
traits we're trying to streamline how we

762
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:48,990
can select for traits and then we

763
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:54,269
advanced things to the field so this is

764
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:57,660
an example because we have field trials

765
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:59,759
every year right and and in 2016 you

766
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:03,300
know that in 2015 is when the phyto

767
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,730
biomes groups started really getting

768
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,930
going and so we thought in 2016 in our

769
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,309
field trials this is what we're going to

770
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,110
do we're going to do some sampling of

771
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:12,389
our rhizosphere and we had actually

772
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,669
planned to do some pilot biosphere as

773
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:17,790
well but well ran out of time and

774
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:20,160
resources but we set up a really nice

775
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:23,099
trial in the field in 2016

776
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,620
we applied seed treatments in the spring

777
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:28,798
when we planted this and this is silage

778
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:31,048
corn so we had four different biological

779
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,490
treatments six corn hybrids and four

780
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:34,470
nitrogen levels because we're testing

781
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,480
environmental variability management

782
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,610
practices things like this and we had

783
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,339
three reps there which is fairly typical

784
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:44,339
and in a lot of field trials especially

785
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:47,899
of this size so and we had a randomized

786
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:50,699
complete block design these are our

787
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,090
yield results and again this is silage

788
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,769
so it's it's tons per acre and

789
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:59,699
experimental one there's actually that

790
00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:03,058
k5 as2 that I had shown previously and

791
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,700
we had significant differences among our

792
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:09,829
treatments there in the field and just

793
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,909
one note is kind of owing to the

794
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:13,889
variability that we see in the field

795
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,690
often when we analyze data we use an

796
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,429
alpha point one just so you know that's

797
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:21,230
how this was analyzed alpha point one

798
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:26,369
not 0.05 which would be more typical of

799
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:28,829
a lab kind of experiment so we did this

800
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:32,399
and I'm gonna go a little bit faster I

801
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:35,039
thought I'd get you guys out early so so

802
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:38,309
then we implemented a process which is

803
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,820
to study the the rhizosphere of this and

804
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:44,549
and so we collected samples root at rye

805
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,039
severe samples in the field isolated DNA

806
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,330
so we could look at 16s and I TS right

807
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,099
because we're working with fungal

808
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:52,739
products so we want to make sure that we

809
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,358
sa the funding that are present we are

810
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,428
leveraging the the Oxford nanopore

811
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:59,039
technology the min I on because this is

812
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:01,019
a technology that has a good price point

813
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,250
we can bring it in-house and we don't

814
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:04,679
have to wait in line to get our

815
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,880
sequencing done wherever we are and if

816
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,529
we decided we want to put something on a

817
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,960
sequencer that day it takes an hour and

818
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,660
a half to make the library and we can

819
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,309
get it on so and that's the time is

820
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:18,868
coming down to 10 minutes FYI so so and

821
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,389
then we do the sequencing and then

822
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:24,240
there's all the downstream which is the

823
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:28,139
the sequence analysis which I think I

824
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:30,809
can skip over at this point so

825
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,299
uh just a brief word about the main ion

826
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,710
sequencing this is really if you're not

827
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,240
familiar with it this is a really unique

828
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,579
technology that I guess Peter Schweitzer

829
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,819
is going to get at the core facility

830
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,920
here you can have reads like the power

831
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,220
users have reported reads up to 2 mega

832
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:51,180
bases long for a single read compared to

833
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:52,859
alumina which is 1 to 300 depending on

834
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:55,549
what you're doing here but the error

835
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,410
rates are much higher than Illumina and

836
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:01,560
so it's a that's a trade-off but if

837
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:04,170
you're thinking about sequence length

838
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,420
versus depths and that's something that

839
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,070
you can think about this technology is

840
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,869
feel double if we wanted to which we

841
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,970
don't we could take this to the field

842
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,429
actually and run it off the laptop and

843
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,230
the in the back of the truck and they're

844
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:17,819
continually improving this the this

845
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,510
error rate has actually dropped quite a

846
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,260
bit over the last year just because of

847
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,140
technological changes with that

848
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:29,220
instrument so so that's a really nice

849
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:31,409
technology but it also leads to some

850
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,079
challenges for us because we're getting

851
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:36,210
far fewer reads then then you would for

852
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,279
Illumina and we have a higher error rate

853
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,869
we do get longer reads than an Illumina

854
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,600
which means we can that we can look at

855
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:44,549
longer sequences in terms of IDs we can

856
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,769
look at the whole ITSs region if we want

857
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:51,180
to and and the the other negative we

858
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:53,730
have is that we're interested in looking

859
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:55,529
at fungal communities and why that's

860
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,960
important is because a lot of the the

861
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,540
software development for analyzing some

862
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,920
of these things is for 16s is for

863
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:06,840
bacterial genomes not it's not fungal so

864
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,639
and the other negative is time our

865
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,530
bioinformatics

866
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,119
you know I'm kind of having to come up

867
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,400
to speed and some of this stuff so

868
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,069
looking at time there's a really clear

869
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,019
there's a so okay for those of you who

870
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,300
are not working this area chime is a

871
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:25,500
software and actually now there's chime

872
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:28,200
to which allows you to look at these

873
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:34,199
kind of meta genomic microbiome type of

874
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:37,319
data and and ultimately find where the

875
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:40,679
differences are identify what is in your

876
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,280
DNA sample and then find out a little

877
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,649
bit about

878
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,180
either well it doesn't tell you function

879
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,960
but you can really interrogate what some

880
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:50,789
of those different organisms are you

881
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,309
know this is fine to use if you're

882
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:56,969
working on 16s and if you have really

883
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:58,710
high read numbers like with aluminum but

884
00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:03,000
if you're working with mini on data as

885
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,610
we are sadly the lower read number and

886
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,920
the higher error rate means that chime

887
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,980
kicks out most of our reads and were

888
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,930
unable to make make it all the way

889
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,110
through the pipeline with more than

890
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:19,259
about nine features so so our pipeline

891
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:25,470
is is we generate the data and we use

892
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:27,780
the Oxford nanopore technology software

893
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:31,439
to do the basic quality based calling

894
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,090
and quality filtering and then a blast

895
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,880
plus analysis and script based

896
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,490
manipulation of the blast output which

897
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,119
in all honesty is where we need to be

898
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:44,819
because having the the chyme analysis

899
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:48,509
looking at reams and reams of data on

900
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:51,740
for 16s isn't necessarily going to get

901
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:55,950
me closer to developing a new product

902
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:59,039
what I want to understand is is a little

903
00:38:55,949 --> 00:39:02,549
bit higher level than that where I don't

904
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,050
need to know all the different strains

905
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,840
that are there what I need to actually

906
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,880
do in the end is find a what the

907
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,039
function of that rhizosphere

908
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,760
is and there are definitely tools out

909
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:17,639
there to do that but in terms of being

910
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,080
able to go this far as we are this is

911
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:23,429
actually what I need to be doing right

912
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:27,269
now so just to quickly run through

913
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:29,659
massive amounts of data this is what we

914
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:32,489
found so we sampled that corn field in

915
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:34,559
2016 and we determined a core microbiome

916
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:37,469
by filtering based on bits core remember

917
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,750
I'm looking at blast output and

918
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:42,029
co-occurrence in all three reps and so

919
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:47,219
we had a lot of data loss and what I'm

920
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:50,070
showing you here is a 16s results so we

921
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:52,089
ended up with with the core microbiome

922
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:56,260
that was fairly small

923
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:58,840
and oh sorry see is the control Oh as

924
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,000
Omega remember that is contains no

925
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:06,850
living biological it's just the

926
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,559
metabolite K is K 5 a s 2 and s is our

927
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:10,469
say bricks for corn products so those

928
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,570
are the four different treatments and

929
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:15,730
and this was a result so you can see

930
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:18,070
here so each line in this graph

931
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,530
represents an organism and you're not

932
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:26,260
expected to read the y-axis because most

933
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:29,380
of those are uncultured so and and there

934
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:33,310
were just too many of them and so what's

935
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:36,700
shown here in blue is that sorry each

936
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:41,469
line represents one organism and the

937
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:43,359
color of that line tells me if if that

938
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:45,730
organism is represented in one of the

939
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,539
treatments or not so for example these

940
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:50,019
bars down at the bottom have the control

941
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:54,190
say bricks

942
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:56,380
k5 as2 and Omega in them okay all four

943
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,389
colors are represented this these

944
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:02,079
organisms are found in all of the

945
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:03,579
samples what's interesting is that these

946
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,849
are organisms that are found only in the

947
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:09,610
control and then these organisms up here

948
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:13,360
are found only in either the say bricks

949
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:15,820
Omega or k5 as2 or some combination of

950
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,720
our treatments so that was really

951
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:22,240
interesting right so that's 16s and then

952
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:24,009
here's a similar although less organized

953
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,129
representation of what we found in

954
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:29,080
looking sorry did I say 16s I was 16 s

955
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,059
this is i TS okay

956
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:35,139
similar representation of what we found

957
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:39,610
for the the i TS community again there

958
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:41,889
were several generous so this is on a

959
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:47,050
genus level that these are listed here

960
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:48,759
that were present in all treatments some

961
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,350
that were in most of the treatments but

962
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,410
there are some that are present only in

963
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:56,679
the control only in say bricks only in

964
00:41:53,409 --> 00:42:00,809
k5 s2 and only in omega so what this is

965
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:02,609
telling us is that we saw changes in

966
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:04,259
or your community that were correlated

967
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,079
with treatments and and this was a

968
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,600
replicated study and so I feel pretty

969
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:13,440
good about this because really we just

970
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,380
wanted to see are we are we moving the

971
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,059
that rice for your community away from

972
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,619
what it is as a control or do we have

973
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:21,659
the ability to achieve it because it

974
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:23,969
gets to mechanism what are organisms

975
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:25,319
doing do they only have an effect on

976
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:28,769
plants because I told you at the outset

977
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,690
that that are that Trichoderma changes

978
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:33,630
plant gene expression is that all

979
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:38,340
they're doing well not necessarily right

980
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:42,090
they are producing metabolites that top

981
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,829
bar up there is Omega this is just a

982
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:47,269
metabolite produced by trichoderma that

983
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:49,259
we've applied to the seed okay so our

984
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:51,000
organism is communicating with the other

985
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,970
microbes in the soil

986
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
probably so is it changing how the plant

987
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:58,579
communicates with with the organisms in

988
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,010
the in the soil

989
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:06,360
maybe so right this what this does is

990
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:08,580
get a lot more questions really so this

991
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,289
is another way of looking at i TS data

992
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,569
and and I just did this yesterday

993
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:14,820
because you know as I said that the the

994
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:17,190
thing we really want to do is look at

995
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,820
the change in function of the

996
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,260
rhizosphere

997
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,800
right are we changing anything

998
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,930
functionally here and so I just

999
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,690
classified the output from the I TS

1000
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:31,409
analysis into different kind of

1001
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,750
lifestyles or functions there in the

1002
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:37,289
rhizosphere and so those are very very

1003
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:38,789
general and what you can see is it and

1004
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,590
it's based on the genus level so for

1005
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:42,659
example that first blue category they're

1006
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,550
beneficial pathogen that means in that

1007
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,920
genus we find both beneficial and

1008
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,420
pathogenic organisms it's a real mix and

1009
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,730
you can't really say oh it's mostly this

1010
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:55,740
or that and and so so you can see in the

1011
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,230
control mostly a mix but you know

1012
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,479
there's what what's notable about this

1013
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:04,170
is that there's more diversity in the

1014
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:09,869
control treatment than in the saber X

1015
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:12,930
Omega rk5 as2 which is enter

1016
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:15,779
because we think about AG chemistry as

1017
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:20,339
being something that reduces diversity

1018
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:24,450
in our crops reduces soil diversity

1019
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:26,370
reduces the you know foliar biospheric

1020
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:29,069
community it reduces that diversity and

1021
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:32,400
we think of that as being potentially

1022
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,809
bad yes we want to get rid of the

1023
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,690
pathogens but we don't want to get rid

1024
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:39,449
of everything else and so seeing a

1025
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:43,530
reduction in diversity here was kind of

1026
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:47,279
interesting to me because okay that you

1027
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:50,400
know this is not that it's the same

1028
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,519
thing as what chemicals do but but it's

1029
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,389
still a reduction in diversity the other

1030
00:44:53,519 --> 00:45:00,000
fascinating thing here is a real

1031
00:44:57,389 --> 00:45:02,879
increase in what I called pathogen right

1032
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,159
and again I called things pathogen based

1033
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,420
on their their genus right that said

1034
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,339
there are a lot of things like for

1035
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,990
example in Fusarium there are pathogens

1036
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,600
there and there are things that are not

1037
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:19,729
pathogenic so so what we've really done

1038
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,469
is just change this distribution and and

1039
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:28,710
but it definitely argues against kind of

1040
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:30,689
a niche replacement model here so so

1041
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,880
this analysis as with all the other

1042
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:35,369
analyses that I've just shown you

1043
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,980
they gets more questions then it does

1044
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:40,230
answers but it really makes us start

1045
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,980
thinking about what our products and and

1046
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:47,639
what a biological might contribute to AG

1047
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:49,110
so with that I would like to turn over

1048
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,079
there if there's any time for questions

1049
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,820
but you know my summary is pretty simple

1050
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,069
I mean you know we're assembling storing

1051
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:59,309
consortium that have an effect and a

1052
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:00,809
beneficial effect on crop production I

1053
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:02,969
think what's going to be really valuable

1054
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:05,130
going forward is assembling very large

1055
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,929
phenotypic data sets I think probably

1056
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,789
everyone in this room here knows that

1057
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:10,679
that's where the bottleneck is in making

1058
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:12,570
progress with all the sequence data is

1059
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,909
we need to have the phenotypic data that

1060
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,670
goes right along with it and then this

1061
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:19,619
is my teeny tiny little conclusion from

1062
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,930
what we did in the twenty sixteen trial

1063
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,819
is that our seed treatments that we used

1064
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:25,289
in that corn trial appear to influence

1065
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,590
devices for your community membership

1066
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:29,759
and that's what I like so with that if

1067
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:52,410
there was any time for questions I'd be

1068
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:55,590
happy to take some you mean a biological

1069
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:58,170
product yeah so that's something that

1070
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:01,079
we're in that we're initiating now but I

1071
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:05,280
know that that dr. Harmon has done that

1072
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:07,319
we're applying something on a winter rye

1073
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,570
so planting it in the fall and then

1074
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,700
planting back in in the spring I think

1075
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,830
he did this with raspberries and showing

1076
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,849
that where the riah had been inoculated

1077
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:19,500
in the fall then they had more

1078
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:23,519
Trichoderma on the raspberries when they

1079
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:25,380
planted them that spring that said and

1080
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:26,789
we also have lots of data on winter

1081
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,470
wheat which is planted in the fall and

1082
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:30,659
then you see it in the spring again but

1083
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:32,609
typically um when we think about

1084
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:34,949
perennial crops or something like this

1085
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:38,130
our recommendation is to treat every

1086
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:42,719
year but well yeah we're a company we

1087
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:44,280
want to sell it right but those are data

1088
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:50,369
that that we are still in the process of

1089
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:53,540
acquiring so yeah there was an effective

1090
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:56,400
tractor on gene expression in the plan

1091
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:58,409
what is the magnitude of that change in

1092
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,210
gene expression and then do you see a

1093
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:03,539
similar type of gene expression done in

1094
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:07,110
different environments with that okay to

1095
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:08,610
the environment question first you know

1096
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,900
we haven't tested it in a lot of

1097
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,820
different environments but a lot of

1098
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,170
different people around the world have

1099
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,170
and it's mainly greenhouse environment

1100
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:18,240
is is where that's being tested and so

1101
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:22,349
it is something that's reproducible seen

1102
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:26,009
over and over again magnitude they are

1103
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:28,289
significant and I'm just trying to you

1104
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,570
know I mean statistically significant

1105
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:33,650
and I'm afraid I don't have the

1106
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:36,490
specifics on that but

1107
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:39,970
Oh tents

1108
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:46,269
yeah wait number of genes or magnitude

1109
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:48,009
of change Oh hundreds yeah yeah oh yeah

1110
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:53,769
I appreciate that you have a very

1111
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:56,410
challenging problem it seems if I

1112
00:48:53,769 --> 00:49:00,969
understand you correctly that the final

1113
00:48:56,409 --> 00:49:03,219
biome varies from field to field just to

1114
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:05,439
start with that what you're trying to do

1115
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:09,608
is to change it to make it more

1116
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:15,780
favorable for plant growth and so you're

1117
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:18,969
trying to match the organisms

1118
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,969
[Music]

1119
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:29,588
contributing to the particular field

1120
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:32,800
then once you do that in one year we

1121
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:35,670
change the final biome that presumably

1122
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:42,930
if you keep doing that year after year

1123
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:42,930
then you have the perfect fighter biome

1124
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:54,489
particular preparation right well yes

1125
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:57,250
and no I would say that well okay so

1126
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:57,969
first of all this is something that's in

1127
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,608
its infancy

1128
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:03,219
can we actually shift the microbial

1129
00:50:00,608 --> 00:50:07,170
community in a given field over time

1130
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:10,569
such that it becomes a generally

1131
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:13,900
agriculturally conducive field well that

1132
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:15,369
remains to be seen you know and I I

1133
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,139
think that there should be a lot more

1134
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,838
work on organic soils and things like

1135
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:21,848
this but have all the the the microbial

1136
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,679
communities been characterized there and

1137
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:26,080
it's a problem of environments right

1138
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,579
because every field is different and so

1139
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:32,230
how do we assay every single one of

1140
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:34,119
these fields to determine the to get the

1141
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,530
ability to make a global shift to say

1142
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,720
that okay what you need to do in this

1143
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,700
field is applied this product year over

1144
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:43,439
year over year and then move this into

1145
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:45,699
the into something that's a preferred

1146
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,010
microbial community and so then it's

1147
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:50,319
going to be the perfect field so

1148
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:52,030
am i worried about you know putting us

1149
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,890
out of business because because if

1150
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:55,090
people start using our products then

1151
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,889
they're just going to improve their

1152
00:50:55,090 --> 00:51:00,490
soils and that'll be that

1153
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:04,259
not really because because that's a long

1154
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:07,629
way off and I mean that's a long way off

1155
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:10,990
before we can say all that the other

1156
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:13,510
thing that happens is weather right you

1157
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:14,679
have a hot dry year even though you've

1158
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,600
done all this work to try and improve

1159
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:17,829
your soils you could kill it right there

1160
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,299
right

1161
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:22,960
you could change everything in a single

1162
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:25,690
year so or you have a disease come

1163
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,699
through or an insect or something like

1164
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,829
this that that brings another microbe

1165
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:31,329
you know changes the chemistry of the

1166
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:33,369
plant that's actually in that soil

1167
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:36,699
remember you're planting plants in here

1168
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:39,940
too and that has influence as well so so

1169
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:41,199
I'm not worried about my job any man

1170
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,780
that regard there other reasons why I

1171
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:47,199
might worry about that some but you know

1172
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:49,900
I think that that figuring all this out

1173
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:55,559
is gonna take some time I may be wrong

1174
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:59,650
but because it's a systems biology

1175
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,389
problem that also has weather right it's

1176
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,019
not just biology it's whether a soil

1177
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:03,549
environment

1178
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:08,259
it's everything so there are human

1179
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:10,360
factors as well so so you know once we

1180
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,770
let all the data scientists just be in

1181
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,599
charge of everything then we'll probably

1182
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:24,610
be fine but you know we're along with

1183
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:31,329
them in Geneva or other locations all

1184
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:34,360
right Thank You Molly this has been a

1185
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:38,400
production of Cornell University on the

1186
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,400
web at Cornell edu
