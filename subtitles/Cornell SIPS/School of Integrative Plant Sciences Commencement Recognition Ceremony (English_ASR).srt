commencement this year which I'll

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:31,018
explain in a moment but first I promise

12
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,570
just a couple remarks on the first day

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,759
went both our undergraduates and

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,850
graduate students arrived I tell

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,089
everyone that there is nothing that the

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,939
faculty and staff at Cornell want one

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,420
more than for all of you to succeed and

18
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:51,539
so this is a culmination of that success

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,090
so thank you for succeeding thank you

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,030
parents and friends for helping your

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,199
students to succeed and thank you to the

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,340
faculty for all the work you put in to

23
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,978
get to where we are with these folks

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,400
today I've had the pleasure of getting

25
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:12,000
to know many of you and it's remarkable

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,728
to me how much each of you has taken

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,400
control of either your schoolwork or

28
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,560
your research project and really found

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,689
your own voice and I think that's so

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,020
important as students as you move

31
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:31,379
forward to remember that voice and to

32
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,789
continue to use that voice and one of

33
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,310
the things that many of you know I'm

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,280
very passionate about is using your

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,469
voice to connect to the public and the

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,960
communities that you move to so I

37
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:45,390
sincerely hope that each of you will use

38
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,419
your voice to speak to those with whom

39
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,909
you agree and to speak with those with

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,799
whom you might not agree but to use your

41
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,200
voice to bring people together and to

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,490
bridge the gap that sometimes

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,859
between the public and our academic

44
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:04,589
institutions so with that we're going to

45
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,349
start our festivities we are today

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,729
honoring undergraduate majors in the

47
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:13,739
plant sciences and Agricultural Sciences

48
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,799
along with our graduate students in the

49
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,500
fields of horticulture plant biology

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,439
plant breeding plant pathology and

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,469
plants my group on biology soil and crop

52
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,479
sciences and what we're going to do

53
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,489
today for the first time so be a bit

54
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,798
patient with us if you would as we are

55
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,560
actually going to have the director of

56
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,200
undergraduate studies the section chair

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,140
for each of our graduate fields along

58
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:43,048
with the major advisor for each student

59
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:50,729
the major advisor will in fact put the

60
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:53,129
hood on to each candidate I did some

61
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:57,209
research into the history of the hooding

62
00:02:53,129 --> 00:03:03,959
ceremony and it actually comes from

63
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:07,859
ancient while older times in in Europe

64
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:11,039
and specifically in England and and it

65
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:15,000
was a sign of the difference that there

66
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,879
was between those who were in academia

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,039
and those were who were not and the the

68
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,889
term it's not that the term town and

69
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:27,209
gown actually originated during those

70
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:29,420
times and and I think that these days we

71
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,829
hope to bring town and gown together and

72
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,989
through the ceremony well we are being

73
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,020
hooded we'll also remember that we are

74
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,730
the town so without further ado we are

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,870
going to start with the field of

76
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:45,659
horticulture the certificate will be

77
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,879
presented to each graduate by dr. Steve

78
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,159
riders share of the horticulture section

79

the money for the check actually came

287
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:46,090
from the payout of an endowment that was

288
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,058
left by Charles a ring really over 100

289
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:51,220
years ago was 1913 when this endowment

290
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:52,960
was given the Cornell and it was given

291
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,808
for the advancement of plant sciences

292
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,220
but but it was also given because and

293
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:01,628
I'm reading a quote here that comes out

294
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,149
of the archives that says because my

295
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:05,980

300
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,570

304
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:37,230
like to invite Tony de Tomaso to come to

305

sectioning of soil and crop sciences

308
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,900
he's also the director of undergraduate

310
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:56,780
major Tony alright we're now getting to

311
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,400
the really exciting part which is

312
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,019
honoring our undergraduates in the

313
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,509
agricultural science of Plant Sciences

314
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,309
majors just one of us on that

315
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:07,710
regretfully professional Margaret Fritz

316
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,359
who's the director of undergraduate

317
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,460
studies for the plain science major and

318
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,559
his son Kevin is graduating this morning

319
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,600
in the Department of Entomology so he

320
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,779
couldn't be here so hence why I'll be

321
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:21,269
covering the dual purposes of announcing

322
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:23,519
our undergraduates for you fair

323
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,740
appearance friends just want to tell you

324
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,869
this is an amazing group of students I

325
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,279
mean you look at what they've achieved

326
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,989
in the four years they've been the

327
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,660
Grinnell Lurie in some cases even less

328
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,670
than that it's truly amazing and I'm

329
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,040
expecting some great things from all of

330
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,390
them so with that just I'd like to know

331
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,759
how this is going to work I'm going to

332
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,400
be announcing the names of the students

333
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,259
in both majors in alphabetical order so

334
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,840
it'll be a mix of act science and plant

335
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,369
science I will mention also what the

336
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,409
green are getting in many cases there

337
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,439
we've got double majors here I II D

338
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,029
students are definitely high achievers

339

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:19,250
hopefully in some cases your kids in

512
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,039
sons and daughters they're kind of

513
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,510
progressing through Cornell and what

514
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,338
they've learned a lot but we've learned

515
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,020
a lot as faculty and it's probably one

516
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:28,969
of the things that I personally but I

517
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:31,969
know a lot of my fellow faculty members

518
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,739
enjoy is to be part of something that's

519
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,049
greater than us and I always tell these

520
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:38,108
students if I could get to Cornell I

521
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,359
