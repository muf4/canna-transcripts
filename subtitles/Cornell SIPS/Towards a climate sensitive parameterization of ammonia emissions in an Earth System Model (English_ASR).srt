1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,558
thank you for inviting me and as you can

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,240
see from my background i'm not a soil

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,079
scientist

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,278
i study atmospheric chemistry and

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,358
climate

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,320
but for better worse sometimes one has

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,480
to cross disciplinary boundaries

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,198
and to see the problem solved in other

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,000
words to look at ammonia emissions on a

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,039
global scale and a comprehensive earth

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
system model there was no soil scientist

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,320
or biogeochemist or anyone that really

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
wanted to address this problem on global

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,878
scales and

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,238
so um

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,199
here i am

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,439
um before i begin i should acknowledge

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,520
stuart riddick so stuart was a postdoc

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,000
here he later left for university of

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680
cambridge so he initially formulated

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,479
much of this model

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,280
and

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,479
um

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,879
and he formulated its structure

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,358
and also dan ward who's sitting in the

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,359
audience today he's done a lot of work

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,159
since stuart left getting the model in

30
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,200
shape

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,359
and um understanding how it behaves okay

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
so both both stuart and dan

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,560
did a lot of the actual work on the on

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,560
this on this project

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,799
so before i begin i thought i should

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
um

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
let's hear my questions that i'm going

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,560
to address in this research so they're

39
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,399
probably different than

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,118
many of the talks you've heard in this

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,759
um in the seminar series and i work on

42
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,400
the global scale

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,280
and i'm interested in climate

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
so the large scale questions is how do

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,599
fertilizer manure ammonia missions

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,398
change the climate and how will climate

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,078
impact these emissions

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,239
how do these emissions modify the

49
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,478
nitrogen cascade and how do the

50
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,078
emissions change global pollution in

51
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,560
health so again i'm interested in the

52
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,599
global scale and most of the work i do

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
is in model simulations it's not it's

54
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,000
not in the laboratory it's not

55
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,000
experimental in that sense

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,080
so this is a

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,759
way it's a picture of paris march 14

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
2014

59
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,719
and this pollution event was attributed

60
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,199
to springtime fertilization it was very

61
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,520
hot at that time in paris it's about the

62
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,039
springtime when people applied their

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,879
fertilizer

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,239
and it pretty much shut down the city

65
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,560
for a week they cars could only drive on

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,400
on even or odd days public

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,560
transportation was free they decreased

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,959
the driving speed limit

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
trucks were routed around the city so a

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,719
lot of this was um has been blamed on

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,800
fertilization and ammonia emissions

72
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,239
okay so after introduction i'm going to

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
talk about the model i'm going to talk

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,200
about some of the nitty-gritty

75
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,199
get the results and and then conclusions

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
so for the background as

77
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,158
i'm sure many of you are

78
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,039
aware

79
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:14,079
that the um

80
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,439
nitrogen input into the

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,159
earth system has increased dramatically

82
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,199
in the um 20th century and it's

83
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,479
increased

84
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,039
really since um haber in bosch

85
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,639
um invented the process for

86
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:34,239
making ammonia fertilizer out of out of

87
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,158
out of atmospheric nitrogen

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,840
okay and so one can see this increase

89
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,158
especially here

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,000
after about 1940

91
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,158
and this increase has been thought to

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,639
contribute to the large population

93
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,679
increase over the 20th century

94
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,839
and incidentally as i i read a little

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
bit about haber haber was also not only

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,878
invented nitrogen

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,519
this process the but he also is known as

98
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,079
the um father of chemical warfare invent

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,200
a lot of chemical weapons so he he has

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,360
he's an interesting character with um

101
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,560
pluses for humanity and

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
definitely some minuses

103
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
okay so what's going to happen in the in

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
the future

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
and in the future as a population

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,839
increase

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,959
the feeling is that

108
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,439
um

109
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,519
the demand for nitrogen is also going to

110
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,079
increase and so this shows a number of

111
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,839
scenarios for nitrogen fertilizer

112
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,000
consumption so this is nsaid 2100

113
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:40,879
and these scenarios are driven by

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,279
population growth shown here in red

115
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,639
biofuels shown in green

116
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,959
um

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,560
and then what decreasing the emissions

118
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,319
is um efficiency and agriculture

119
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
food equity is increasing so we don't

120
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,439
quite know what's going to happen in the

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
future but

122
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,879
um

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,478
and this is so these are the type of

124
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,040
scenarios that are used in climate

125
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,279
models this is how the um how the

126
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,319
climate models work to predict the

127
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,839
future

128
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,279
is there's likely going to be an

129
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,159
increase in

130
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,599
nitrogen fertilizer consumption

131
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,520
and if you look

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,240
in what's input into most climate models

133
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,319
the

134
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,079
ammonia emissions are like this

135
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,279
reflecting this increase

136
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,839
in in in nitrogen but this neglects the

137
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,758
impact of climate on the emissions so

138
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,839
ammonia emissions are very sensitive to

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,879
climate if you

140
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,198
add the impact of climate

141
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,478
then my guess that the ammonia emissions

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,639
increase by almost a factor of two

143
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,038
so this impact of agriculture and the

144
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,038
increase of nitrogen emissions

145
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,199
is quite a bit different than what one

146
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,719
expects from

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,280
industry and cars and here

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
almost all the scenarios expect the

149
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,399
other component are the main component

150
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,840
of nitrogen input into the system to

151
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,159
decrease

152
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,079
and this is because already industrial

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
countries have decreased the amount of

154
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,800
nox emitted into the air

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
for air pollution regions and it's

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,639
expected that other countries too for

157
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,918
example china

158
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,759
will also follow along suit and decrease

159
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,079
their emissions of knocks into the

160
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,960
atmosphere so in the future

161
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,279
fertilizer is likely to increase ammonia

162
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,399
emissions due to fertilizer like likely

163
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,399
to increase

164
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:36,478
and nox emissions are likely to decrease

165
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,478
ice acid current current thinking

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,038
so this is a

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,439
figure of the

168
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,759
nitrogen cascade

169
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,038
and nitrogen is essentially put into the

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,520
system

171
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,038
largely into the farms in terms of

172
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,839
fertilizer it's also manure here

173
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,318
and in terms of combustion and this is

174
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,159
mostly in terms of nox

175
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
okay so the nitrogen so the ammonia

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,680
emissions from the farms are estimated

177
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,159
to be about 40 teragrams per year

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
the nitrogen ammonia is evaporated off

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,039
from the farms and then it's cascaded

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,879
down in the nitrogen cascade and it

181
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:19,120
lands on forests natural ecosystems etc

182
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,279
as you go down so to understand the

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,038
nitrogen cascade to be able to simulate

184
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,038
it you have to get these nitrogen

185
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,038
ammonia emissions correct

186
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,519
from the farm and one can see that there

187
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,680
are of greater importance than the

188
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,120
combustion emissions

189
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
and they're meant to increase in the

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
future whereas these are meant to

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,639
decrease so getting these

192
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
getting pneumonia emissions correct it's

193
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,079
important part of being able to simulate

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,079
the future nitrogen cascade

195
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,560
what does nitrogen do to climate

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
so

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,959
in this figure here i show the radiative

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
forcing of various species on the

199
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,439
climate so this is essentially you put

200
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
these species into the atmosphere and

201
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,038
you look at the change in energy balance

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,439
at the earth's

203
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,598
surface due to these species

204
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,079
and one can see that the

205
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,439
change in energy balance from

206
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,478
pre-industrial to 2011 it's estimated to

207
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,560
be about 2.3 watts per meter squared on

208
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,918
the earth's surface according to this

209
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
diagram

210
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,519
now this is known as a radiator forcing

211
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,639
where does nitrogen come into this

212
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,000
nitrogen is a form of fertilizer

213
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,959
and

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,879
it's estimated that because the emission

215
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,119
nitrogen emissions have increased that

216
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,439
more co2 has been uptaken by the

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,240
atmosphere and so this has changed a

218
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,080
radiative forcing by between five and

219
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
ten percent

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,720
and to all emissions associated with

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,839
fertilizer use exchange to radiate

222
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
forcing by about 0.17

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
nox emissions

224
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,080
through his atmospheric chemistry

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,879
decreases methane and increases ozone

226
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,720
associate changes in atmospheric forcing

227
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,958
and then pneumonia emissions itself

228
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
ammonia readily forms an aerosol in the

229
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,679
atmosphere aerosols tend to be

230
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,278
reflective and this is active to cool

231
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,199
the earth's surface

232
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,679
so the nitrogen emissions have a lot of

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,720
climate effects from warming

234
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,719
to cooling

235
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,120
and probably one of the most important

236
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,838
impacts

237
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,240
is in the aerosols aerosols are

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
particulates in the air

239
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,320
that um

240
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,838
that essentially cool the earth

241
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,640
and if you look at various various years

242
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
so this goes from 2000 to 2100 this is

243
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,240
from

244
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,120
simulation

245
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
and

246
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,240
it's projected that by 2100 this yellow

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,759
yellow line here which is ammonia

248
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,320
nitrate emissions

249
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,278
ammonium nitrate aerosols will be

250
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,560
the dominant aerosol species so right

251
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:03,039
now the dominant species is sulfur

252
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,399
it's projected that sulfur will decrease

253
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,719
as the air is cleaned up over

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,360
china and other regions

255
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,920
and that ammonia nitrates will become

256
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,600
the dominant aerosol type which acts to

257
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,599
cool which acts to cool the earth

258
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,359
with nitric acid

259
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,879
okay so

260
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,639
in the beginning at the top was input of

261
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,159
of ammonium emissions into an earth

262
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,278
system model

263
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,439
and it could be that some of you um

264
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,360
um are not really familiar with what we

265
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,240
mean by nurse system model so here's

266
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,440
kind of a timeline of how they're

267
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,399
developed

268
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,279
so in um 1896

269
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,320
1900 using hand calculations arrhenius

270
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:05,278
predicted five to six degree warming for

271
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,278
double co2

272
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,680
and then it waited almost a century

273
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,320
until general circulation models were

274
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,559
able to include double co2

275
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
and the difference between a hand

276
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,159
calculation in the

277
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,319
general circulation model large amount

278
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,639
of the of the earth and

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,760
an ocean was they allowed feedback due

280
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,519
to water vapor and clouds although

281
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:32,240
generally these models got about the

282
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,320
same result as arenas got by by hand

283
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,799
and then later on

284
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,278
okay you can predict the climate of the

285
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,439
um 20th century until you allow for the

286
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,679
cooling due to aerosol scattering these

287
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
were included in the late 1990s into

288
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,759
these models

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
and then around the early 2000s the

290
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,319
carbon cycle was incorporated because if

291
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,239
you add co2 to the atmosphere

292
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
it's taken up about half of it's taken

293
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,360
up by the ocean and the land

294
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,440
and so this allows if you want to

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,839
include a transient response if you want

296
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
to simulate the climate from the from

297
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
now into um

298
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,278
2100 you need to incorporate carbon

299
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
cycle

300
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,958
and if you incorporate a carbon cycle

301
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,639
you need nitrogen

302
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,879
and but nitrogen emissions were

303
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,799
generally not simulated and ammonia

304
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,879
missions were generally not simulated in

305
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,278
these models which is where this study

306
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,278
comes in

307
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
okay

308
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,200
so now i'm going to start talking about

309
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,079
the ammonia emission model in the middle

310
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,040
of um in the middle of a

311
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:37,039
earth system model their system model is

312
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,919
essentially

313
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,799
it's a numerical model it's formulated

314
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,639
as a number of grid squares

315
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,078
like here so they range in the

316
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,919
horizontal and in the vertical

317
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,000
and each square here each of these

318
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,639
square squares we have a model a

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,120
parameterization that simulates ammonia

320
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
emissions okay

321
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,959
so that's where so this is how it fits

322
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,959
in into this large scale model

323
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,199
and these are the questions

324
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,879
i remind you of the questions i want to

325
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
address from the beginning and these are

326
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,320
global questions how does ammonia

327
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,799
missions influence climate

328
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,600
so the idea is to take a essential

329
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,599
process level model by extend it to

330
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,680
global scales

331
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,839
and to do this we have to

332
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,759
simplify local details to a notable

333
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,480
global simulation so we can put all the

334
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,319
details in this kind of model many of

335
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,120
the details are not available globally

336
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,240
it's very hard to get details of

337
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,278
crop type soil type etc

338
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,360
fertilizer day etc globally

339
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,799
and the highly complex regional models

340
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
are not are pro

341
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,159
appropriate for global simulations

342
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,920
because the global simulations we're

343
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,159
simulating many things for simulating

344
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,799
the ocean the atmosphere

345
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,120
aerosols etc so we have to

346
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,719
simplify the model

347
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,959
we want to base this type of model in

348
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
physics and chemistry to the extent

349
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,919
possible

350
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,519
um because things are based on imperial

351
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,078
parameterizations

352
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,560
and won't be sensitive to

353
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,399
changes in temperatures changes in

354
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,919
precipitation

355
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,679
so so

356
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,759
if we base on basic physics and

357
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,519
chemistry then we think we can

358
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:30,078
incorporate the changes due to

359
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,000
precipitation and changes in temperature

360
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,759
modeling is an iterative procedure i

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,360
think it's important to remember that

362
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,439
i've talked about modeling here at

363
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,039
cornell and many times people so it's

364
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
too complicated how can you simulate

365
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,240
that forget it

366
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,480
and and

367
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,079
the thing to recognize is that

368
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
okay if you don't simulate it it's not

369
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,799
going to be in there so you can simulate

370
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,799
it

371
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,159
to zeroth order and you have some idea

372
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,799
of how it's going and you can improve it

373
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,958
so it's good to start somewhere

374
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,879
and so i'm interested in is examining

375
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,319
the response of the emissions to forcing

376
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,360
changes in climate temperature

377
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,920
precipitation eventually changes in

378
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,919
management

379
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,839
processes okay incidentally if anyone

380
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,838
has any questions ask me um as they go

381
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,679
i'd just like to contrast the model i'm

382
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,480
going to present with a standard model

383
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,679
so to most ammonia emissions in global

384
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,800
models are based on emission factors

385
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,278
so for example you take the

386
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,519
dairy cattle you take the kilogram

387
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,078
nitrogen per head per year

388
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,198
you multiply it by the

389
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,278
ammonia

390
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,519
loss and you get a number and that's why

391
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,759
you stick as your emissions in the model

392
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,919
and traditionally these have been split

393
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,078
into one region and two into two

394
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,879
different regions depending on whether

395
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:57,359
the agricultural practices were relevant

396
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,360
for developed countries or developing

397
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,600
countries so the standard type of models

398
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,079
people have used to predict global

399
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
nitrogen global ammonia emissions have

400
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,278
not included any temperature

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,600
or

402
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,600
dependence on temperature or rainfall

403
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,519
so what we do

404
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,679
is we take a fertilizer amount or manure

405
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,278
amount and we know this fairly well

406
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,198
there have been some studies that

407
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,799
published in nitrogen and fertilizer

408
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:27,919
nitrogen and manure globally

409
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,159
and we take this amount

410
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,639
and we feed it in

411
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,360
into a model for

412
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,360
fertilizer manure

413
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
and then this and then it can go

414
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,639
three ways

415
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,399
the nitrogen in there can go to wash off

416
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,079
if it rains

417
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,320
it can go into emissions and the

418
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,159
emissions depend on the meteorology they

419
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,720
depend on the wind speed and the

420
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,078
temperature and the um surface roughness

421
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,278
so they depend on the boundary

422
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,159
turbulence

423
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,320
and

424
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,319
temperature

425
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,639
or

426
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,439
the emission or the nitrogen

427
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,038
incorporated into fertilizer manure can

428
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,160
go into

429
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:13,038
the land model which is another part of

430
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,759
this larger system model and within the

431
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,279
land model the nitrogen is apportioned

432
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,359
to vegetation

433
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,720
to soil organic matter

434
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,198
it goes up and it denitrifies

435
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,240
it can go into leaching runoff

436
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,519
it can go into fires etc okay so this is

437
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,279
a base model

438
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,599
that's already incorporated and we're

439
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,759
adding this parameterization on top of

440
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,759
it

441
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,000
then we need another important thing in

442
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,319
these large scale models is to conserve

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,038
carbon and nitrogen so when you add

444
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,159
fertilizer this is new nitrogen created

445
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,000
so

446
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,080
you don't have to worry about that but

447
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,119
from in the work manure comes from

448
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,759
nitrogen that's eaten from the plants

449
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,719
so you have cows eat plants

450
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,720
they

451
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,400
excrete manure

452
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,279
and then you have to have then you have

453
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,440
to um take the um carbon and nitrogen

454
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
out of the plants

455
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,200
to make them ignore so these type of

456
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,360
models is very important to conserve

457
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
carbon and nitrogen because you want to

458
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,240
look at how these

459
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
how the budgets change

460
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,678
okay this is um

461
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,840
this is a cow for stuart stewart

462
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
scottish so i think is a scottish cow

463
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
so

464
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
what we've done if we have a

465
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
pool

466
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
of

467
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,038
ammonic nitrogen here

468
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,919
as i said this can wash off it can go to

469
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,839
gas

470
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,038
or it can go into the land model to the

471
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,038
nitrogen pools here

472
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,038
fertilizer goes into this pool

473
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,678
as does

474
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,919
um manure

475
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,320
and manure is divided into three

476
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,759
separate pools depending on how fast

477
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,038
it's broken down

478
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,558
by

479
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,879
bacteria

480
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,200
okay and then again there's a cycle from

481
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,840
the land model back to the plants to

482
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,640
conserve the carbon and nitrogen from

483
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,639
from the manure

484
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,759
tan

485
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,759
total and molnenko nitrogen

486
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,759
okay

487
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,240
so for fertilizer it goes into a pool

488
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,240
so you add the fertilizer to this pool

489
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,279
this quickly decays it depends on the

490
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,440
temperature how fast it decays

491
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,200
and it goes into tan pool for simplicity

492
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,759
we only apply the fertilizer towards the

493
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,519
beginning of the growing season

494
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,720
when planting conditions for corn are

495
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,879
met

496
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
and this is determined from meteorology

497
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,960
so if the growing so if it gets warmer

498
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
in the spring

499
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,679
this this fertilization application will

500
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,759
occur warmer or warm years you'll hear a

501
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,200
different time than cold years

502
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,359
and throughout we don't consider

503
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,360
agricultural practices in the models so

504
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:13,199
agriculture management is going to have

505
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,199
to be added on at a later stage

506
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
okay

507
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
manure

508
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,160
as i said it goes into three different

509
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,279
pools

510
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,080
this is a tan pool here these pools

511
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,038
these available resistant unavailable

512
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,399
decay at different at different rates

513
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,879
they break down at different weight

514
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,280
rates depending on temperature so one

515
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,280
day for this available pool

516
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,200
much longer for this resistant pool and

517
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,720
this unavailable pole essentially gets

518
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,720
incorporated into the soils

519
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
we assume the manure is spread on the

520
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,799
fields continually

521
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,600
throughout the year and again this is a

522
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,639
place where we decided not to consider

523
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,558
agricultural practices

524
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
by putting on the fields a few times or

525
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,798
keeping the cattle in stockyards etc we

526
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,600
just assumed it was spread continually

527
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,599
onto the fields

528
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,600
okay and then the tan pool what goes on

529
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,639
in here

530
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,158
we essentially have an equation for the

531
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,240
ammonia gas

532
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,600
that's an equilibrium within a water

533
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,480
solution

534
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,480
within this pool

535
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,960
so the gas depends on the amount of n in

536
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
this pool

537
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,319
and then there's some rate constants

538
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,120
below it depends on

539
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,678
on the ph and some henry's law rate

540
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:42,000
constants as given here

541
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,679
and it depends on the amount of water in

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,919
the pool so we have to predict the

543
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,919
amount of water also in the scan pool

544
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,839
and the rate equations are such that the

545
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,839
gas

546
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,079
the amount of gas emitted

547
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,319
increases exponentially with temperature

548
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,119
so there's an exponential temperature

549
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,839
increase here as uh as this as this

550
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,239
warms it becomes less soluble to ammonia

551
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:12,359
and there's more ammonia gas sitting

552
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,359
right on the boundary of the pool

553
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,678
okay

554
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,959
oops

555
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,880
let's do this emissions

556
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,640
our century proportional

557
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,559
to the amount of gas sitting on the

558
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,320
boundary of the tan pool minus the

559
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,038
amount in the atmosphere divided by some

560
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,038
resistances

561
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:39,119
okay and then this we take the wash off

562
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,000
from the global news model

563
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,639
run off from the tan pool

564
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,960
okay and then there's um

565
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,559
conversion from the tan pool to the soil

566
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,558
pool which we simply

567
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,599
account for as diffusion either of

568
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,399
ammonium or nitrate and it has different

569
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,399
diffusion rates

570
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,759
okay so i think i talked about these

571
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,158
assumptions

572
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,240
let's go on to the

573
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,799
results

574
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,440
so this is a distribution from potter

575
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,038
head off 2010

576
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,480
of nitrogen

577
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,720
from manure and nitrogen from

578
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,759
fertilizer

579
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,319
and

580
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,839
one can see for both menu and fertilizer

581
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,879
they are um

582
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,119
europe

583
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,120
india china

584
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,719
midwest here are

585
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,839
our

586
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,960
areas of heavy

587
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,599
application and then from manure it

588
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
brings in a number of other areas brazil

589
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,119
here

590
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,000
sub-saharan africa

591
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,918
across this region here

592
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,599
okay so this is used as input to the

593
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
model

594
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,000
and then we see what then we see what

595
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,000
happens

596
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,519
and so we predict nitrogen emissions

597
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,798
um this is the 10-year average in the

598
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,279
model

599
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,000
this is from manure this is from

600
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,000
fertilizer

601
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,840
and again for the nitrogen emissions you

602
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,839
can see these hot spots over india

603
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,558
and china

604
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,759
you can see hot spots here over

605
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,759
on this part of africa

606
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,559
india etc and this is because

607
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,000
the emissions increase exponentially

608
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:32,399
with temperature so you warm temperature

609
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,558
you get more fraction of the amount of

610
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
the tan pool that evaporates as

611
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,399
emissions

612
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,798
yeah are these emissions from the

613
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,798
surface

614
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,640
these are from the

615
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,399
surface but the units are kilograms per

616
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,679
year per hectare

617
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,679
right so they're

618
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,679
surface emissions per unit area per year

619
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,480
okay so

620
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,798
um yeah so what we do is we account for

621
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,000
a canopy capture of the emissions so

622
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,918
once we once we put the once we so this

623
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,159
is we're looking at the emissions from

624
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,840
the land model once we connect it to the

625
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,760
atmosphere then we'll be able to

626
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,918
simulate how much goes up and how much

627
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,640
goes down so you so you're right there's

628
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,200
a bi-directional flux of ammonia that's

629
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,159
very hard to simulate so here we assume

630
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,919
some canopy capture from some

631
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,440
numbers in the literature but that is

632
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,759
one of the assumptions that will be

633
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,759
changed

634
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,200
so here

635
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
again you can see in these

636
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
over india

637
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,120
sub-saharan africa where it's warm a

638
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,440
large percentage of the

639
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,479
emit a large percentage of the ammonia

640
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,960
and the emissions are released

641
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,360
as ammonia gas into the

642
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,360
into the atmosphere

643
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,798
okay

644
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,240
okay

645
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,038
the u.s to be much higher in

646
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:08,079
okay well i mean there are two things in

647
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:09,679
your question one is um the database

648
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,158
i mean maybe

649
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,120
i mean this is one of the best databases

650
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,799
available and what they did is they to

651
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,479
combine this they took

652
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,639
um

653
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
they counted animals in each country and

654
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
they took information from fao

655
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,480
etc

656
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:30,000
and so this is the best as far as i know

657
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,558
um

658
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,200
database for fertilizer and animals now

659
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,960
maybe it might not be correct i i i

660
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,720
don't know but this is i mean this is

661
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,440
exactly one of the problems in trying to

662
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
apply these things globally is that we

663
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,440
just don't have that good data

664
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,440
okay

665
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,440
okay so evaluation

666
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,159
how do we how do we do i want to um

667
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,840
go over this pretty quickly

668
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
um because here i'm showing some

669
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,639
evaluations from previous versions of

670
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,879
the model though i expect it will be

671
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,919
similar in these in this in this current

672
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,000
version

673
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,919
and this shows

674
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,919
manure emissions versus

675
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,519
model versus measurement

676
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,599
r square is .84

677
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,639
annual the average amount percent

678
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,278
evaporation changes from five to ninety

679
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
ninety percent and one can tell this

680
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,278
correlation between the model and

681
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,200
measurements is largely driven by this

682
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,398
change in temperature when temperatures

683
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,399
high you get

684
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,479
large emissions of ammonia might be

685
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,959
expected

686
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,679
correlation with um

687
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
fertilizer is not as good but still

688
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,519
significant

689
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,679
and here again it's probably driven by

690
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,918
temperature we've looked at different

691
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,559
um emissions some fertilizer different

692
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,559
latitudes

693
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,278
okay i should say um

694
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
as this has already been brought up

695
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,278
valuing on the emissions are

696
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,120
very difficult

697
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,640
the concentrations are not well

698
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,479
characterized

699
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,038
missions are bi-directional they can be

700
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,960
up and down depending on the

701
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,158
time of day

702
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,679
ground-based measurements are

703
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,039
challenging they're highly dependent on

704
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,798
meteorology

705
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,558
and the emissions are captured by the

706
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,918
canopy and describe a rather complex

707
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,038
resistance model so it's a is is

708
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,640
when you make a model you have to

709
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:31,038
evaluate it but evaluation here is um is

710
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,200
is challenging

711
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,798
so another way to evaluate a model is to

712
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,519
compare it against

713
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,879
other emission inventories

714
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,119
so in each of these diagrams is the is

715
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,960
our emission inventory

716
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,759
this is the most recent one which has

717
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,679
come from a data inversion

718
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,839
it's another one which is

719
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,559
has developed within the last four years

720
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:58,000
and this is a standard one used by

721
00:29:54,558 --> 00:30:00,720
global atmospheric fathers

722
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,759
these are split between manure

723
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,000
and fertilization emissions

724
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,798
we can see that we our emission

725
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,798
inventory is about all of them in fact

726
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,599
are about the same

727
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,079
about the same amount of nitrogen

728
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,158
are split between

729
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,319
fur emissions ammonia emissions from

730
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,320
fertilizer and manure

731
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,119
is a little bit different than these two

732
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,759
we

733
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,158
show more fertilizer less manure

734
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:32,480
so it's between this one and this one by

735
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,799
edgar so we write like right between

736
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,599
i should say that all these inventories

737
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:41,278
here it's a great deal of uncertainty on

738
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:45,038
these on these global numbers

739
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,038
if we can look at different regions

740
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,679
our u.s emissions so this is

741
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,319
us us and us

742
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
china notice that the scale is one as

743
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,519
212.

744
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,558
u.s and europe is

745
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,558
to 4.5

746
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,679
so all of the all the emission

747
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,319
inventories predict higher emissions in

748
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,200
china that even though then over the u.s

749
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,678
and

750
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,840
and europe

751
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,080
our emissions over the u.s are higher

752
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,599
than these other inventories largely

753
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,839
because we have larger fertilizer

754
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,000
emissions

755
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,278
same with um in over europe

756
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,319
where

757
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,079
where our

758
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,839
manure emissions are a little bit lower

759
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,240
than some of these obvious

760
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,000
but generally considering

761
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,880
the um what we're trying to do in this

762
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,159
model

763
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,159
um

764
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,720
we're pretty pleased with with with

765
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,278
these results we're capturing the um

766
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,679
emissions

767
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,440
within the range of the other emission

768
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,000
inventories where there's a great deal

769
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
fair also

770
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,480
yes we do

771
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
yeah

772
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,959
yes

773
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,798
yeah so we assume fifty percent of the

774
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,798
nitrogen is from year and fifty percent

775
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:14,918
from in newark and then the manure piles

776
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,918
have different rates of breakdown

777
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,440
okay so um oops

778
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,839
okay so once the manure is in this tan

779
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,000
pool then there are different ways it

780
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,319
can go it can volatilize to the

781
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,558
atmosphere has competed so

782
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,720
if it's washed out a lot it won't fall

783
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,158
to lies as much

784
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,240
and so this shows the runoff from manure

785
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,640
and runoff from fertilizer

786
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,640
one can see the runoff in these models

787
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
again as concentrated as one might

788
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,159
expect in

789
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,679
regions of high application and in moist

790
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,360
regions

791
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,798
eastern u.s europe china and india shown

792
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,558
here

793
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,319
fertilizer manure and that's this

794
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,200
percent runoff so again as these regions

795
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,319
um

796
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,080
china

797
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,960
europe has quite a high percent eastern

798
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,960
us

799
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,880
in this region and over

800
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,960
brazil in both

801
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,440
fertilizer and and

802
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,399
manure so this is one of the things

803
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,960
that

804
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,359
we can use this model to do is that in

805
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,558
the future as precipitation changes

806
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,278
presumably these patterns of manure loss

807
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,359
due to runoff will also also change in

808
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:31,359
the

809
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,398
future yeah so this is surface runoff

810
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,079
there will be additional runoff

811
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,839
from leaching once it gets once the

812
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,000
nitrogen from there goes into soil so it

813
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,678
can be run off first but this is this is

814
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,359
surf deep

815
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,360
no no it's not yeah

816
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,720
so in a um in another work again this is

817
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,960
preliminary results it's uh from cindy

818
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,079
nevison and all and what she's doing

819
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,000
it's looking at observed river export of

820
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,639
nitrogen

821
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,358
from rivers around the world

822
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,079
and we can also calculate this quantity

823
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,078
in in the model i mean the calculation

824
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,560
is indirect we need to know how the

825
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,200
rivers run how much of the nitrogen in

826
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,320
the rivers is denitrified but one can

827
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,319
see

828
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,320
it's a way of bounding

829
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,919
is another way of constraining these

830
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,200
type of parameterizations in earth

831
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,559
system models by looking at the runoff

832
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,480
in

833
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,480
in rivers which sure is pretty good data

834
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,440
global fate of applied nitrogen

835
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,200
fertilizer

836
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,440
the emissions are

837
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,799
globally just under

838
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,679
25

839
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,000
the

840
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,480
runoff is a little bit higher

841
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,800
and most of it goes into the

842
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,719
soil

843
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,640
for the manure because the manure is

844
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,879
applied slowly throughout the years not

845
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,759
applied as quickly

846
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,640
you see there's less ammonia emissions

847
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,839
less runoff and more gets into the more

848
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,838
it gets into the soil

849
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,879
okay one looks at developing countries

850
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,519
or

851
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,760
developed countries

852
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,119
developing countries tend to occur where

853
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,839
it's

854
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,838
warmer

855
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,320
and

856
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:40,159
and you can see that in

857
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,559
developing developing countries that the

858
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,598
emissions ammonia emissions

859
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:48,559
generally are higher than in these

860
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,760
developed countries this is global

861
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,719
us

862
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,359
europe

863
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,759
india china

864
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,519
so you can see europe there's quite a in

865
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,160
these calculations there's quite a bit

866
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,639
high ammonia emission so this this may

867
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,279
have to do partly with when we apply the

868
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,279
fertilizer

869
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,000
yeah this is largely temperature

870
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,400
so we assume the so it does have a

871
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
significance

872
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,039
but

873
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,159
we assume so far it's seven okay because

874
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,119
um

875
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,199
stewart's assured me that the ph of

876
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,119
manure is about seven

877
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:37,279
and a lot of soils are buffered to be

878
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
about ph of seven but that is a i mean

879
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,280
it is definitely affected by soil ph

880
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,838
that we haven't incorporated that that's

881
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,839
a good question

882
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,400
well the losses implies

883
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,838
most of the nitrogen put up that implies

884
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,079
that's where the end phase of the

885
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:05,119
nitrogen from manure fertilizers the

886
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,800
soil organic matter okay but it doesn't

887
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,240
mean it's increasing because so it can

888
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,200
be lost from the soils either by

889
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:14,879
leaching by denitrification

890
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,559
by forest fires by other beans okay

891
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,800
so it's not and then it's not a yearly

892
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,920
increase it just it's just where is it

893
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,920
going once it's in the manure

894
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,879
that's right yes

895
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,200
yeah this green here is essentially

896
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,599
leaving our model and then it can go

897
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,838
into plants it can be leached out a

898
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,240
number of other

899
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,239
fates okay

900
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,358
okay and then one advantage of models is

901
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,838
you can see what's happened

902
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,480
over the last

903
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,559
um 150 years

904
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,920
and this is the case for

905
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:00,639
global manure this amount applied

906
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,760
this is the amount going into soils

907
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,400
runoff

908
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,040
and into emissions

909
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,920
and so you can see over over time that

910
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,838
the amount going into soil has decreased

911
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,079
as the amount going into emissions and

912
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:19,400
runoff has increased over the last

913
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,400
percentage-wise over 150 years

914
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,799
for fertilizer we get quite a bit

915
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,280
different picture fertilizers added all

916
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,280
at once

917
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,519
and in the beginning when very low

918
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,559
amounts of fertilizer added

919
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,838
these calculations suggest that only a

920
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,639
little bit

921
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,159
most of it was incorporated into the

922
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,799
into the soils

923
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,960
but as much larger quantities were added

924
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
very quickly

925
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,159
that less could be incorporated into

926
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,640
soils and larger percentages were going

927
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:57,960
into the air as ammonium

928
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,960
as ammonia or into runoff

929
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,200
um

930
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,358
sensitivities we've looked at

931
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,719
at some of them i think in the interest

932
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,838
of time

933
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,838
i won't go over these

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,079
i want to briefly review future work

935
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,960
obviously

936
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,240
agriculture management practices are

937
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,039
important and can impact the emissions

938
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
fertilization dates spreading practices

939
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,838
feed yards

940
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,039
and this is a

941
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,519
view of

942
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,920
saturn at all how one should do climate

943
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,960
dependent ammonia missions

944
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,639
some of them should be on to the fields

945
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,199
as we did some of it should be applied

946
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,679
as manure where you might use a

947
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,719
parametrization like ours

948
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,199
some of the um some of it goes into

949
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,078
unidirectional emissions due to feedlots

950
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,679
and these should probably be

951
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,760
parameterized differently because this

952
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,000
isn't a controlled environment they're

953
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,280
not they're not immediately sensitive to

954
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
rainfall

955
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,920
or

956
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,760
the temperature outside and these can be

957
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,838
computed using

958
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,599
emission factors okay so there could be

959
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,679
quite a bit of work

960
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,519
adding this to

961
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,838
adding more management practices and

962
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,159
even future management practices into

963
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:22,639
such a model to see how emissions might

964
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,639
change as a function of of climate

965
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,838
obviously once we get the um

966
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,519
once we get the emissions into the

967
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,838
atmosphere then we can see what the

968
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,880
atmosphere does and in the atmosphere

969
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,759
once we do that there are a lot

970
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,079
many many ways to um

971
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,000
the model many more ways to evaluate it

972
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,280
can evaluate against atmospheric

973
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,159
measurements

974
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,680
against satellite data against

975
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:52,319
wet deposition against aerosol data etc

976
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,719
and we're eager to look at how emissions

977
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,039
will change in the changing world as the

978
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,439
amount of manure and fertilizer probably

979
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,838
increases as as

980
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,519
management practices change

981
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,519
and as the climate as the climate

982
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,519
changes

983
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,960
okay so the

984
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,719
conclusion um

985
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,960
ammonia is poorly modeled in earth

986
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,759
system models and i hope i made the case

987
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,119
that

988
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,119
there is a

989
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,000
importance in being able to incorporate

990
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,039
it into in these models to look at the

991
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,960
impact of ammonia and climate but also

992
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,400
important as there's an importance of

993
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,880
looking at the impact of climate and

994
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,800
ammonia emissions

995
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,720
missions are expected to increase as the

996
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,760
population grows

997
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,598
implications for nitrogen cascade for

998
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,760
formation of aerosols and there's

999
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,960
implications which i didn't talk about

1000
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,440
for global pollution and health

1001
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,440
talked about global dependent

1002
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,039
climate-dependent global parametrization

1003
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,000
of the emissions

1004
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,239
responsive to temperature precipitation

1005
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,440
it has the ability to conserve nitrogen

1006
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,479
carbon

1007
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,639
and

1008
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,480
suggest strong geographical and diurnal

1009
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,480
temperature dependence

1010
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,920
um so these i talked about for these are

1011
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,838
first steps

1012
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,800
um and you can obviously there many

1013
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,799
improvements possible

1014
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,880
and then there are numerous applications

1015
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,960
they're understanding role of nitrogen

1016
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,318
as climate changes

1017
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,800
so i um thank you for your attention

1018
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,800
i would um if any of you have feedback i

1019
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,280
would very much appreciate it as i said

1020
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,599
i'm not so a scientist but i would very

1021
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,720
much appreciate any feedback from people

1022
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,960
who are in the field or know

1023
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,279
how this type of parametrization could

1024
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,318
be improved

1025
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
and

1026
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,159
i'm going to have to run off to class in

1027
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,639
just a few minutes but thanks for your

1028
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,639
attention

1029
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,599
