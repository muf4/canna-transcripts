1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,820
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,820
University

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,548
it's real honored to be here and a

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,899
pleasure guys this is kindly coming to

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,480
the heart of what this whole program is

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:21,070
about I'm a hydro ecologist I worked in

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,349
wetlands for almost all my life until

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,609
about seven years ago I was put in what

9
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:30,099
was said was a desert I'm thinking oh

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,049
I'm used to water so learning a lot

11
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,090
about agriculture watering agricultural

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,890
systems and so we have lots of questions

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,450
in our and I thought today you know I

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,700
think I'm gonna give an overview of the

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,010
whole thing my goal is that it will

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,050
stimulate discussion and maybe different

17
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:47,259
pieces will appeal to different people

18
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,968
and we have lots of lots of skill to do

19
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,649
lots of things we're trying to learn and

20
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,000
if you know something about it hear me

21
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:53,259
say something that doesn't make sense or

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,789
you know something different we're

23
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:57,219
trying to learn about it so feel free to

24
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,140
email me or call me or talk and say I

25
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,518
want to talk to you about that piece so

26
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,960
what you're hearing today is kind of an

27
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,250
overview of the whole program okay I

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,170
want to think there's a lot of people in

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,030
this probably the most important one is

30
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,230
this woman direct Alicia and she's

31
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,180
actually the head of the names of

32
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,159
Forestry institutes the director of the

33
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,530
laboratory of seedling bioengineering

34
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,630
she's so influential that she's the one

35
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,129
they asked the governor of ningxia

36
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,319
province which is like the equivalent of

37
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,938
a state we need to restore this area

38
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,408
you're in charge they put her in

39
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:28,478
Congress for China she's that

40
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,939
influential and she's been a big

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,530
motivating force dr. Sheng Shanley at

42
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:35,319
Southwest University in Chongqing is

43
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,090
actually responsible for restoration of

44
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,250
the Three Gorges reservoir at the entire

45
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,310
riparian area around there this here is

46
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,930
a Humphrey Solo back in like 2008 he's

47
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,329
one who brought Cornell over and said

48
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,530
these people can help us Steve where he

49
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:48,728
always over in our department I'll

50
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,728
mention some of the work he does but

51
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:53,108
he's been my partner the enormous all

52
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:55,090
this going back and forth to China

53
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:57,009
Harold's been influential from the

54
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,350
beginning and guiding us and a lot of

55
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,849
people how do you see your names up

56
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,629
there we've come to talk to you about

57
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,339
what we're doing

58
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:05,019
you've given us advice out of you we're

59
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,020
really good about being collaborators on

60
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:09,549
proposals and supporting us so there's a

61
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,868
lot of people who have helped in

62
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,610
different ways and it's much appreciated

63
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:16,780
and hopefully we keep we'll keep

64
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:19,360
building this program all right so what

65
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,250
I'm gonna do is give you part about

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,810
what's the framework for what this whole

67
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,098
project is about it's kind of what we've

68
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,199
come to understand this

69
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:28,479
about agriculture in the world which is

70
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,578
what you guys do feedback welcome and

71
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,738
then with that context was also got what

72
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,579
we've been doing endings for China we

73
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,378
started moving into the Great Plains and

74
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:39,849
Mandan North Dakota and then we have

75
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:41,259
some new directions for going so as I

76
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:42,638
said there's a lot of pieces to this and

77
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,519
hopefully I'll keep you with me

78
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,139
throughout all right the big issue is

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,870
this one of how to feed the population

80
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,909
of the world basically we have nine

81
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,650
billion people by the year 2050 and we

82
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:54,998
have to close a nearly 70 percent gap

83
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,799
between how much we currently produce

84
00:02:54,998 --> 00:03:00,489
and how much we're going to need to

85
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:03,280
produce I do water so I'm always focused

86
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,378
on the water part and the reality is all

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,658
the water we consume around the world

88
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:09,128
70% of it goes to use for irrigation to

89
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:12,340
grow food so this is really to be

90
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:14,168
initial of water currently about 2.2

91
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,449
thousand eight hundred cubic kilometers

92
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:19,000
of water consumed each year just for

93
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:21,099
irrigation only a quarter of our crop

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,438
lands are irrigated and that delivers

95
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:26,378
one third of our agricultural production

96
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:29,408
so one solution to the food problem is

97
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:31,418
AG intensification we will increase our

98
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:36,370
yields through more irrigation more

99
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:38,979
fertilization but the reality I do water

100
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,859
is that we are already waters arguably

101
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,569
wet the most scarce limiting resource on

102
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,120
the earth it's not energy and I'll fight

103
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,828
I'll argue that a lot there are all

104
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,780
different kinds of analyses of how many

105
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:52,000
people are subject to global waters to

106
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,949
water scarcity it was always done on an

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,709
annual basis and about the approximate

108
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:59,109
number was about both 25 percent of all

109
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,169
the world's population deals with some

110
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,239
level of water scarcity and then in 2016

111
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:06,699
the study came out well actually if you

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,680
just look at one on a monthly basis four

113
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:10,060
billion people have water scarcity I

114
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,489
mean they don't have enough water and

115
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,919
get any given month and so it's really

116
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,168
almost half the world's population deals

117
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,759
with water scarcity and up here where we

118
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,439
throw away fresh water we it rained so

119
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,509
much we get rid of it it's kinda like

120
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,959
wow we don't really pay attention how

121
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:27,520
important this issue is all this has

122
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,310
been exacerbated by climate change

123
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,649
because it's changing where how often

124
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,689
and how much rainfall we get and so this

125
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:36,429
is just one of the model predictions for

126
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,449
changes in certifications around the

127
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,430
world and what

128
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,620
Stanground as it gets browner that means

129
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,300
you have fewer and fewer inches of rain

130
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,370
per year and that's what we saw like the

131
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,288
big drought in California and in large

132
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,088
parts the world less water to work with

133
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:51,188
so that issue is let's increase

134
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,809
irrigation to me is like guys that is

135
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,789
not a good solution we need water for

136
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:58,020
people to drink we need water for all

137
00:04:54,788 --> 00:05:01,058
the other uses we have for water

138
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,519
the second big factor is soil

139
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,809
degradation and so again this is now

140
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,818
getting to your realm that's why I'm

141
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:09,159
pleased to be here and that land

142
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,348
aggregated this was an estimate in 2017

143
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:14,069
land degradation has made it to about

144
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:16,120
1/4 of all the global land area and

145
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,088
there are different maps showing high

146
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,968
severity very high severity so large

147
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:24,129
portions of the land are really degraded

148
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:26,519
which affects their ability to produce

149
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,520
crops

150
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,620
and once you have unhealthy soil then he

151
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,570
actually need more water to get the same

152
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,399
amount of crops and this is a photo just

153
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,469
show you what we saw you in nature China

154
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,120
where every single thing you see if you

155
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,680
see something run it's got a drip

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,139
irrigation too it's either coming from

157
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,090
ground water which is very scarce they

158
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,529
don't monitor it or it's coming from the

159
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,109
Yale River which also runs dry and

160
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,589
location so it's very I mean everything

161
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,750
has to be irrigated all right

162
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:57,239
the agriculture to grow the food IQ PI's

163
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,759
basically 40% of all the land service of

164
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,410
the earth either as cropland or as

165
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,539
pastures and there's that whole issue of

166
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,580
well we could have eaten meat we can

167
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,960
shift this over to growing crops and

168
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,579
it's much more efficient and that's one

169
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,930
of the solutions when you look at all

170
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,560
what are the solutions to deal with

171
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,170
needing to produce food however there's

172
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,819
this cool fact and this was the epiphany

173
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,460
for me as I was learning about this

174
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,199
system it came out in a 2013 report by

175
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,120
the Union Nations environmental program

176
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,399
addressing these issues of how do we

177
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,139
grow enough food and what they did is

178
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,709
looked at all the land surface of the

179
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,490
earth and said well okay 5,000 million

180
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:37,560
hectares or just deserts glaciers others

181
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,780
3,900 or forests but where we have

182
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,050
permanent pastures and arable in all of

183
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,209
that was grassley where we put all of

184
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,480
our agriculture which and almost night

185
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:52,649
like 95% of it used to be grasslands and

186
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,360
that was really interesting so when you

187
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,359
start to think well grasslands huh

188
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,050
there are lots of like a lots been gonna

189
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:03,060
grasslands but interestingly they

190
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,639
basically kind of generally came into

191
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,649
three categories savannas prairies or

192
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,819
steps even the Great Plains of the

193
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,068
United States that we tend to call

194
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,139
prairies actually now in some places are

195
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,389
calling it a step and so do you think it

196
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,650
well if it's a third of the land surface

197
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,120
of the earth you think there'd be a

198
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:20,429
little bit more diversity to it than

199
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,000
just three types of grasslands and right

200
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,038
now

201
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,689
nature serve T and C are definitely

202
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,399
starting to say well that is true I mean

203
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:28,199
there's a lot of different kinds of

204
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,908
grasslands they're not all the same and

205
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,579
then we're getting to understand them

206
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,348
better okay

207
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:37,620
but the key point is that grasslands

208
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:39,870
where we put our agriculture developed

209
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,939
in areas that are semi arid or arid all

210
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,038
right less than five hundred millimeters

211
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,080
of rainfall year they're naturally

212
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,769
evolved to deal with semi arid

213
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,269
conditions

214
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:53,038
okay so Whitaker put out a long time ago

215
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:55,889
the biomes of the world here's

216
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,019
grasslands and basically in this

217
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,629
moderate temperature range but low

218
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,538
precipitation progresses and they were

219
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:06,088
incredibly productive historically this

220
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:09,329
is where he had this incredible all

221
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:11,550
these different bison bison in above

222
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,348
it's all these different migrations and

223
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,550
below-ground had all this productivity

224
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:16,288
is well these are millions and the

225
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,520
millions of animals and blue ground

226
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,769
there's all like tons of different

227
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,060
species of rodents and prairie dogs and

228
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:25,408
then there were birds and insects and

229
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,418
here's this incredibly productive first

230
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:30,149
it's um different levels of the food web

231
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:32,250
right all living in a system that was

232
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,838
very air eating it now this is where we

233
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,668
put our agriculture and we're having

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,649
trouble growing things you think what

235
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:39,598
what have we done to that system that's

236
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,418
made it now not be able to support what

237
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,408
it used to support even we're gonna do

238
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,009
I'm going to be showing you what we're

239
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:48,509
doing in temperate grasslands I don't

240
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:49,679
quite and one of the reasons like I

241
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,909
don't know what's going on with tropical

242
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,109
grasslands I don't quite get it because

243
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:55,139
we're gonna be talking about most all

244
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,399
organic soils that form but in like

245
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,198
Africa they have some of the highest

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,328
species diversity of mammals

247
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:01,919
particularly bovids which are horn

248
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,838
animals that are have hollow horns they

249
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,610
don't drop off incredible species

250
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,730
diversity that meant that those

251
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,690
grasslands were stable long-term

252
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,789
environments

253
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,440
that kind of speciation to occur I don't

254
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:15,539
know what the mechanisms are that

255
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,590
maintain those systems in terms of

256
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:18,629
moisture but we're going to talk about

257
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,250
the temperate ones nonetheless here's

258
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,899
the thing all this product committee in

259
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,250
semi-arid conditions one factor in the

260
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,579
temperate systems where these moments

261
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,500
all soils enter you guys which were deep

262
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,680
organic soils that form because the

263
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,899
grasses with decaying roots decaying

264
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,579
leaves that would build up in the soil

265
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,409
and have this organic matter that was

266
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,670
basically like a cellulose sponge is the

267
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,259
way I like to think of it or I explain

268
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:45,959
to people you know they used by your

269
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,990
sink it absorbs and holds water and so

270
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,519
much of the United States the green here

271
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,320
are the Mullis all soils up there

272
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,429
there's a whole bunch down in South

273
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,280
America large parts of Asia had these

274
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,319
soils that were a factor in a semi-arid

275
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:08,579
climate that when it rained it could

276
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:10,260
hold that moisture alright so when you

277
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,940
look at this is the most well-documented

278
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,100
case that we can find which are the

279
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,300
great plains of the United States where

280
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,450
mussels being 60 to 75 75 or more

281
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,740
percent of US soil is a Mullis all soil

282
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,780
throughout the central the dark colors

283
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,330
which is right where our tall grass

284
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,399
mixed grass short grass prairies mainly

285
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:34,610
days there occurred that's those were

286
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:37,110
our mon-sol soils and then John Deere

287
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,940
1837 so this is again you guys know it

288
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,529
was stuff but for me you know I live up

289
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,270
in transferred this farm fields there's

290
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,459
green tractors everywhere I look to say

291
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,259
John Deere and I think you know there's

292
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,330
this guy out there somewhere oh he

293
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,860
invented the stainless steel plow that

294
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,940
was the first thing that could actually

295
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,100
break through the grassland sods and

296
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,780
10,000 of these were sold by 1855 and

297
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,409
that's what allowed agriculture to

298
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:04,620
develop in our country so 1855 we began

299
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:07,679
to break apart the grasslands the soils

300
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,149
and then we began to erode away and then

301
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,209
in other places that was livestock over

302
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,919
grazing but basically what I can tell

303
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,259
the surface most all soil began to

304
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,729
disappear and the it's well documented

305
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,230
there was the Dust Bowl in the Great

306
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,120
Plains and it was actually black sundy

307
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,860
because that was the black organic

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,278
matter blowing across the landscape and

309
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,409
there

310
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,139
all these no very iconic photograph

311
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:29,999
showing loss of little surface organic

312
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,249
layer 16 million acres destroyed in

313
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:34,139
Texas by erosion terrace to protect your

314
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:36,120
farm and it was beginning from what I

315
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,639
can tell the NRCS and their whole kind

316
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,149
of health program soil health program in

317
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,370
the United States but so as we think

318
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:47,539
about well what was the original soil

319
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:52,948
like it's not that easy to find out

320
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:55,528
so NRCS start I can get access to maybe

321
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:57,299
I'm monitoring erosion and there's all

322
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:58,769
these different maps from 1982

323
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:04,588
I don't read like two to four year

324
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:07,289
intervals and so this is 1982 1987 90 to

325
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:10,199
97 2002 these are the rates of erosion

326
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:13,708
per region and when you add them all up

327
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:17,039
it was about 180 tons per acre of

328
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:19,018
erosion and I don't give me this great

329
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,519
photo but we can find other photos and

330
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,459
the question is yeah but that was

331
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,730
already in 1982 black sunday was like

332
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:28,198
1933 and plows were in 1855 doesn't

333
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,688
serve almost a hundred more years of

334
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,429
erosion that wasn't documented what did

335
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:34,318
the soil look like what are these soils

336
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,179
that were so productive that could

337
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:39,808
support so much life what do they look

338
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:42,448
like that's the one that is

339
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:44,370
well-documented agriculture has been

340
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,909
going on apparently for thousands of

341
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,870
years

342
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:50,308
so if you go to Crete at Greece and this

343
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,078
is actually where I was reading this

344
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:54,808
book in Greece right before we went to

345
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:58,019
China and it's like oh create used to be

346
00:12:54,808 --> 00:13:00,509
covered in soothing shade trees it was

347
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,879
all gone it was a barren soil and the

348
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,339
only vegetation left was called a fruit

349
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,470
for ganya a soul incapable of holding

350
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:10,529
moisture only plants left for aromatic

351
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,689
drought-tolerant shrubs and go to it

352
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:14,490
neat and all the trees have been and

353
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:16,769
then you can read about it taken away

354
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,709
either to build chips where around most

355
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,139
of the world articulated as a fuel for

356
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,748
heating work for cooking you don't ever

357
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,669
leave wood behind and gradually what it

358
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:31,500
looks like it's a barren landscape okay

359
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:34,500
and that was in 425 right now and the

360
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,639
pampas of Argentina a lot of native

361
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,909
grasslands are still intact the

362
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,159
conversion is happening again

363
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:40,719
in this case is Nev cattle ranching and

364
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,699
erosion problems are happening and

365
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,440
that's like in less than 30 years and so

366
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,450
there's this kind of timeline of the

367
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,920
further you go back it looks more and

368
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,270
more thinner and eroded and so you end

369
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,089
up with these maps of global soil

370
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:58,539
degradation and rekon Lao out in Ohio

371
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,220
has been doing estimates since the 1990s

372
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:03,480
look guys we have to plead a global

373
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,740
organic carbon stocks by as much as 66

374
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,950
Hika grams no I don't know that's right

375
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,210
seventy two billion US tonnes a

376
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,890
phenomenal amount of her organic matter

377
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:17,019
we have eroded away all right so that's

378
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,819
the background that as I understand it

379
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,039
that this kind of erosion loss has been

380
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,780
going on on what was one-third of the

381
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,969
land surface of the earth because it was

382
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,519
converted to agriculture but it used to

383
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,230
be incredibly productive in the case of

384
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
the temperate areas that was a Mullis

385
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,800
all soil I don't know what the souls

386
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,029
wearing tropical grassland I hate trying

387
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,189
to kind of learn about that but we're

388
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,490
focused here right now so now we go to

389
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:41,740
China and this is China here's Mongolia

390
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,570
and it's this is newly desertified this

391
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,080
is seriously the most seriously degraded

392
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,710
lands are desertified abandoned and the

393
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,780
hatching is where this is occurring and

394
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,280
that's in the Google image we're working

395
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:57,759
right here and here's the gobi desert

396
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,649
mongolia Taklamakan and you can see and

397
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,059
this is actually the Yellow River so

398
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,439
there's a big river that runs through

399
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:08,799
there but the areas seriously

400
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:11,230
desertified so we're working right here

401
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,149
in toin and there's Beijing over there

402
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,710
Mongolia is just north of us just to see

403
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,659
here's this beautiful river running

404
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,050
through but most of the landscape looks

405
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:22,149
like this and literally a Olien dunes

406
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:24,370
blowing sand but when we were there it

407
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,939
rained and then it rained again about a

408
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,190
week later

409
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,860
that's like wait a minute this is not a

410
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,180
desert you have rainfall why what's

411
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,460
going on why don't you have something

412
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:38,709
growing here and we began to realize oh

413
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,220
this is agriculture since almost at

414
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:44,710
least a thousand to 2,000 years ago

415
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,170
this is the landscape now but when we

416
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:51,940
went to a museum there were petroglyphs

417
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:54,039
of grassland animals on the rocks and it

418
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,410
became like this used to be a grassland

419
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,389
you still have rain and we said well

420
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:59,649
where's the organic matter and we spent

421
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,360
an interesting couple days driving

422
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,039
around trying to get them to show us

423
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,409
where there was some organic matter and

424
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,459
we couldn't get couldn't we had a real

425
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:08,769
communication I didn't know what we were

426
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,810
talking about oh well we take all that

427
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,850
away use that to cook with you use it to

428
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:14,739
heat with it it's messy you don't leave

429
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,139
that on the ground it took us a week

430
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,320
almost define the tiniest little layer

431
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:22,000
of organic matter building up and say oh

432
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,730
this has been so degraded you've lost

433
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,320
track of what that was and what its role

434
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,340
was so the our project became what wait

435
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,379
a minute and there were a lot of pieces

436
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,000
else and as well but this is the one

437
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:36,700
note we've really focused on almost well

438
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,340
can you read vitalize this system can we

439
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,230
restore that grassland is there some way

440
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,649
to jumpstart the whole system so just

441
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,000
waiting for it to slowly recover and

442
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,559
we're going to use amendments will try

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,870
and jumpstart the system to a better

444
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,389
level and then can we help increase

445
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,250
their adoption either healthier crop

446
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:56,049
lands that don't require a lot of

447
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,159
irrigation or self-sustaining grassland

448
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:01,569
so that was kind of our goal and so the

449
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,919
underlying question you're gonna see

450
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,269
this continues throughout this issue

451
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,029
what they didn't quite know what we were

452
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:11,619
talking about keeps showing up above

453
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:13,059
what's the goal ideal goal to me as an

454
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,500
ecologist is what we want that nice

455
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,289
healthy grassland bag with all those

456
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,269
animals and all that productivity then

457
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:20,950
it's but can we even figure out what

458
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:23,559
that was given getting data is pretty

459
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:25,809
hard and then what's a feasible target I

460
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,059
mean what's your realistic maybe we

461
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,759
don't mean restoration maybe we mean

462
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,049
revitalization or enhancement maybe we

463
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,390
really need to think carefully about

464
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,859
what these words mean and then what are

465
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,900
the elements and I think of it as a

466
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:39,309
recipe the ingredients of the recipes

467
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,269
that we're going to use to achieve that

468
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:46,119
target so soil amendments this is your

469
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:48,639
guys world being used for thousands of

470
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,589
years from manure all kinds of things

471
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,200
and they either get mixed into the soil

472
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:55,778
or they get put on top of the soil and

473
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,090
mulch and compost manures organic matter

474
00:17:55,778 --> 00:18:00,460
and fine and coarse woody material and

475
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,628
we chose to use coarse woody material

476
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,579
from the beginning because we said well

477
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:05,168
we need this stuff to be there for a

478
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,579
long time if I put in iceberg lettuce

479
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,259
it's gone and a week

480
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:09,999
I need organic matter that's gonna stick

481
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:13,028
around a while and we said we'll go with

482
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:14,139
coarser material and we also said we're

483
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:16,089
gonna look at something different a

484
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:18,638
different pieces we really get branches

485
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:20,858
where we apply not just mixing it into

486
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:22,868
the soil but we're gonna get surface

487
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:25,178
applications so the steam or ele who is

488
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:27,898
a zoologist and which has been studying

489
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:30,669
for 10 years the effective first

490
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:33,158
practices on amphibians reptiles animals

491
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,229
near here done it are not because now

492
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,999
they're clearing when they take out

493
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,528
vegetate trees and all they take every

494
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:41,069
branch it's worth something you can

495
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:43,058
grind it up and make particle board so

496
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,798
they were looking for evidence well you

497
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:46,388
kind of need these piles of branches and

498
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,460
they have all these different date on

499
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:50,228
what animals use them as refugia and

500
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,239
germination and tree growth and deer

501
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:55,538
can't get to them but the relevant one

502
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:57,608
was that they looked at water content of

503
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:59,469
the soil and these are different sites

504
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:01,960
and they looked at sites ahead Apollo

505
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:04,210
franchise in bare soil and consistently

506
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,879
had more water retained in the soil over

507
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,778
time when the branches were present and

508
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:11,048
that was our goal

509
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:12,999
we want more water to stay there so the

510
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:14,888
very first thing we did was a simple

511
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:16,719
experiment the honor student Cornell's

512
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:18,098
honors undergraduate basically a master

513
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:20,950
students other places we have amazing

514
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:22,569
students and it was a very simple one

515
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,379
before we went back to China we said

516
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:26,108
we've got to make sure this is gonna

517
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,728
work he used a very sandy soil it was an

518
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:30,308
artificial constructed one we can't

519
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:33,129
bring the soles over from China and all

520
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:35,138
we did was mix in varying amounts of

521
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:37,988
organic matter of woodchips of populist

522
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:40,058
I'm you Louise trembling Aspen zero it's

523
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:42,278
a control two percent four percent ten

524
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:44,558
percent on a wafer weight basis we tried

525
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:46,808
different species populous black locust

526
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,788
willow cattails these are all present

527
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:51,700
over where we are in Asia by which are

528
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:54,669
and then we put surface twigs as kind of

529
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,440
a proxy for having branches over the

530
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:59,379
surface at five replicates

531
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,950
put 100 milliliters on top and then

532
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:04,119
weighed it every day

533
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,298
so what you see is these are the days

534
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,829
after Wooters ad at one time how much of

535
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,569
that hundred mils is still left percent

536
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:11,889
what are we meaning the black line on

537
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:14,019
the bottom is the control

538
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,520
so obviously water is evaporating

539
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:17,859
there's less water remaining with time

540
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,720
and each of these lines represents the

541
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:22,178
average of one of those treatments all

542
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,950
the way up to we're going to focus on

543
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,500
populous for today so here is 4%

544
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,288
populous and after two weeks we had 18

545
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,419
more 18 percent more water in the soil

546
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:32,650
that hadn't evaporated and if we added

547
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,679
the litter ones how we could get a few

548
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,870
more percent water remaining so we

549
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,659
reduced evaporation by adding wood chips

550
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:42,250
to the soil we had more water for longer

551
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,650
up to a month we still were having the

552
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,599
same kind of retention in the system and

553
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:51,160
all it did was control evaporation

554
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,659
we use that as the basis for going to

555
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,790
China and why don't we had two

556
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,740
technicians working there who then the

557
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,440
first one she gone turned this into his

558
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:03,309
PhD thesis repeated the experiment

559
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,990
butting kind of ultra and so here's our

560
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:08,019
control this is the actual soil over

561
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,599
there it's 90 about 99% sand that

562
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,039
organic matter the twigs on the top is

563
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,699
the equivalent to the lattice of

564
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,240
branches

565
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,700
we tried mulch here's 2 5 8 increasing

566
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,920
amounts of populous they have populous

567
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,440
alba a different one it's planted over

568
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,830
all of China this is a different for

569
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,440
different species of wood different tree

570
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:30,789
species minore rice and wheat and so

571
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,740
that's all the different treatments with

572
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,180
five replicates each looked at a whole

573
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,769
bunch of things infiltration rate

574
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:42,460
microbial respiration soil capillarity

575
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:45,099
pore space he looked at um so bunch of

576
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,660
things the point being that was a set up

577
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:49,299
very similar to what we just did he

578
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,620
weighed them and I put here infiltration

579
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:53,470
rate instead of all the other data

580
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:56,379
because right away it was affecting one

581
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,180
another property another process this is

582
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,790
control and twigs with his up on top

583
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,009
since I control soil and any kind of

584
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:05,409
amendment addition reduced infiltration

585
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:06,039
so there was less water leaching out of

586
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,500
the system

587
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,920
that's so we have another mechanism

588
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,359
somehow alright pause it for six so for

589
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,130
me this was like a no-brainer

590
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,569
Oh wood absorbs water you put what in

591
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,690
the soil it rains and holds the water

592
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:21,399
slowly releases it turns out people are

593
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,200
really questioning the mechanisms here

594
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,269
and so we're putting more time to like

595
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,100
trying to understand what are the

596
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:29,349
precise mechanisms if you think about it

597
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:32,049
when I have branches on top of the

598
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:34,629
surface it shades so that reduces heat

599
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:36,639
right it also affects the boundary layer

600
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,710
so therefore evaporations reduce that's

601
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,900
a different mechanism the wood chips in

602
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,390
the soil apparently we think breaking up

603
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,640
the flow paths so the waters ability to

604
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,290
evaporate is interfered with we haven't

605
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,270
tested my idea that and water is just

606
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,279
absorbing the wood is of blurring water

607
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:54,069
but there's now a whole complex of

608
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:57,160
mechanisms that may be inner all acting

609
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:59,679
together Rebecca yeah how was the water

610
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,019
actually applying

611
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,610
in the experiment the first experiments

612
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:06,789
literally 100 million years is a closed

613
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:08,859
container and was in 25 mil increments

614
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:11,259
slowly at the very beginning of the

615
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:15,279
evaporation experiment I know right

616
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:17,650
right at the surface supported okay as I

617
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,899
said we also are interested well what's

618
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,269
happening below the sort in terms of

619
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,950
life and so in that this was your gods

620
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,960
thesis and in that very complex

621
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,970
experiment he also halfway through at

622
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,029
its seeds to the weed seeds and show

623
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,100
that he could and they and we could

624
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:35,049
affect how much growth here was a week

625
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:39,839
by adding amendments to it you could

626
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,839
affect how much wheat growth we got okay

627
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,120
right the first experiment was applied

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,529
one time just 100 mils one time and it

629
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,259
ran for a month about four and a half

630
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,099
five weeks total this one is a little

631
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,410
more complicated

632
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:59,519
he added at regular intervals at once he

633
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,519
added the week to the system

634
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:05,949
it's a hold on exactly how much water he

635
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:06,910
added so it's more complicated and then

636
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,900
we took that and said all right well

637
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,670
let's look what's happening in the

638
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,190
chemists work in the field those are

639
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,560
just Rican sold experiments and we set

640
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,850
up in ningxia this is the system we're

641
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,460
working in everything back here is

642
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,599
irrigated with a drip tube we had four

643
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,509
treatments I'll show you what they were

644
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,549
five replicates of each we had one suite

645
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,379
that was not irrigated at all and one

646
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:28,750
that was and we set that up originally

647
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,160
because it rained so little with it

648
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,230
we'll have it never rains we'll have new

649
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,210
data will irrigate one half of it and

650
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,650
their word so there were forty plots and

651
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,700
how it was very helpful in getting the

652
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:42,580
design of this set of course so here's

653
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,799
the control soil the unamended soil here

654
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:46,990
it is with woodchips of populist album

655
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,180
mixed in to the top twenty centimeters

656
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,890
of the soil of five percent by volume

657
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,570
this is the chips plus this lattice of

658
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,640
branches it was about thirty percent

659
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:56,439
cover so you can see light throughout

660
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,480
hitting the surface and then we had a

661
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:03,190
surface mulch application all right this

662
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,900
is temperature over one growing season

663
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,350
so that was one of the original things

664
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,420
we saw in the are not forest work and

665
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:12,909
basically here are the controls in black

666
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,279
hitting above 40 degrees centigrade

667
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,320
we had chips then service mulch and the

668
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,059
chips plus the branches could reduce the

669
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:20,529
overall temperatures by almost 20

670
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,289
degrees so we could definitely keep the

671
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:24,819
system cooler obviously when you have

672
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,379
amendment on the surface it helped but

673
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:29,679
even just having chips in the soil

674
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,720
reduce the temperature it also was good

675
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,390
did what we hoped it would do it helped

676
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,610
to maintain up to capture more water so

677
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,700
this is the rain event this is the

678
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:41,859
control this is the chips plus the

679
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,960
branches over top this is chips

680
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:47,469
this is mulch and the rain event occurs

681
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,650
it captures more rain and then it stays

682
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:54,190
moisture for longer that's just one

683
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:56,769
event this is in 2012 and then we have

684
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,410
the same class for 2015 four years later

685
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:01,119
which looked pretty similar this is so

686
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:04,630
water storage over time so here's the

687
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:07,389
control here's the branches plus the

688
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,420
chips underground in this case this is

689
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,710
the chips and this is the mulch

690
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,800
sometimes the Walsh did better sometimes

691
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,289
the chips did better branches plus the

692
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,879
chips always did way better so basically

693
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,319
over the course of a whole summer and

694
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,200
then four years later we haven't changed

695
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,809
anything we still have the same

696
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:33,670
improvements in the system to capture

697
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:36,639
and hold water okay we were agent this

698
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:38,860
had 150 millimeters of rainfall these

699
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,900
are tiny amounts of rainfall over the

700
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:42,729
course of this growing season and so we

701
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,050
said well wait a minute is this normal

702
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,539
it's just what you normally get so we

703
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,879
looked at 15 year record and found what

704
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:50,470
the average amount of rainfall was and

705
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,720
then we looked at well how old as I come

706
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,819
in it comes in as 21 events all rain

707
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,460
events that last for about 1 and a half

708
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:59,859
days very small amounts 8 millimeters

709
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,860
and the key is how many days before the

710
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:04,269
next rain event it was 4 days if we only

711
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:06,699
consider rains bigger than 1 millimeter

712
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:09,339
drop the number of events and increase

713
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,980
it to 5 point 6 so basically it's tiny

714
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:15,579
amounts of rain but it comes at every 4

715
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,360
to 5 days now why that's important we're

716
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,009
trying to think well how do you

717
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,619
translate that does does this make a

718
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:22,390
difference so we calculated what the

719
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:24,639
permanent wilting point was for the

720
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,740
system using a very conservative

721
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,190
estimate said in each of those

722
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,798
these were all irrigated these are not

723
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:35,259
this is 2012 and 2015 for the controls

724
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,509
and so we're basically the days and

725
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,419
justice out on that sediment that's Andy

726
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:42,759
soil you have 50 between 30 and 50 days

727
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:45,429
where the soils below the permanent

728
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:49,000
wilting point with that rainfall pattern

729
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:51,940
in those irrigated situation which got

730
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,700
more water all the amendments helped us

731
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,169
to reduce irrigation demand the number

732
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,880
of days below permit wilting point as

733
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,500
compared to controls so it would make a

734
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,149
difference if you put chips in the soil

735
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,970
you can reduce the irrigation to that

736
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:06,158
and the non irrigated where now no it's

737
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,899
just the rainfall pattern it didn't make

738
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,549
a difference with just the chips but

739
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:11,589
both launched there was only four reps

740
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:13,210
here there are five reps there but both

741
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,918
the mulch and the chips plus the mulch

742
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,929
are significantly different we could

743
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,778
definitely reduce under non irrigated

744
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:22,450
conditions the number of days and these

745
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:25,298
are I mean is it really dry guys 170

746
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,038
millimeters so we're talking sixty days

747
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:31,109
where it's below the permanent wilting

748
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,109
point but still we can make it better a

749
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:36,519
bunch of other things were measured

750
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,940
including soil microbial respiration we

751
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,250
have enzyme activity so carbon microbial

752
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,038
carbon microbial nitrogen but basically

753
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,599
what you see is the control and mulch

754
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,879
mulch does a really good job at keeping

755
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,129
it moist but underneath the soil bulk

756
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,070
density hasn't changed the bacterial

757
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,809
don't grow and so adding the tips

758
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:58,599
actually increase the life in the soil

759
00:28:55,808 --> 00:29:00,398
it's the way we like to think wherever

760
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,408
we have wood in the soil and at both

761
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,898
experiment and in the field we're

762
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:09,130
increasing the whole system's kind of

763
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:11,469
living functioning below ground so so

764
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,690
much so that in 2013 in the middle of

765
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,880
the summer we had moss and mushrooms

766
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,399
growing in the branch wall the branch

767
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,809
chip treatment so it's mostly a

768
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,058
mushrooms in the middle of the desert

769
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:24,819
and in 2016 it was awesome

770
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:26,589
we were working and under a couple of

771
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,869
pounds Rita what are those things and

772
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:31,449
turns out they're long eared hedgehogs

773
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,759
families living back in the middle of

774
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,350
that dry desert II area and they had set

775
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,028
up homes underneath those systems and so

776
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:41,339
overall it's a healthier more living

777
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,289
system

778
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,889
a lot we don't know but things are

779
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:49,259
working better okay it's been difficult

780
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,970
we're in China we can't bring souls back

781
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,490
all the money we have is really coming

782
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,870
from the Chinese government made it hard

783
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,370
to do experiments here so we said we

784
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:58,439
need to find something we can work in

785
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:00,659
the US the northern Great Plains

786
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,390
Research Laboratory which is one of the

787
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,370
longest now it's an LTE rll t8y our it

788
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,920
has about a hundred years of data for an

789
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:10,469
agricultural station it's located right

790
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,240
here and Herald recommended talking to

791
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,089
dr. mark riebeck who say yeah come you

792
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,099
can work with us and it's in the mix big

793
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:19,949
grass prairie in North Dakota and what's

794
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:21,689
totally cool about this is that the

795
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,299
climate in North Dakota is almost

796
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,460
exactly what we get in nature China in

797
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,829
terms of both the temperature Mandan

798
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,730
North Dakota is in blue with a high and

799
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,949
low for each month

800
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,450
the yellow is China Ningxia China and

801
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,450
they're very comparable both in

802
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:40,740
temperature and precipitation patterns

803
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:42,299
but they don't irrigate and they do so

804
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,049
the soils are really different I mean we

805
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:49,259
have 93 percent sand very little organic

806
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:52,500
matter high pH different texture but

807
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,839
still we now have the same climate it's

808
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,730
what can we do to that soil to make it

809
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,859
more similar to this to make it a

810
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:02,279
healthier system so we're trying to

811
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,779
revitalize this system we actually did

812
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,490
an experiment they're the same one we

813
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,470
said well here's no amendment in these

814
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,750
are called caliper shell sandy loam

815
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:13,710
soils here we added chips to the soil

816
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:16,019
ratios plus chips did this in 2015 over

817
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:18,390
the course of the summer biometric water

818
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,460
content we used to decagon probes those

819
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,590
are the rain events and what you see is

820
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,970
these are the average out for each

821
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,709
treatment this is the control soil

822
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,900
moisture content this is when we added

823
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,690
chips to it and here's the branch plus

824
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,060
chips and our colleagues they were very

825
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,950
surprised they thought they didn't

826
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,849
really expect it they go really we

827
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,740
didn't think this would make any

828
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:38,909
difference at all that we could actually

829
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,730
improve the system now they don't

830
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,430
irrigate what Mark said is well actually

831
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,980
our soils are like on the edge if we

832
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:49,019
keep you up with the same practices we

833
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,819
have right now we won't have more

834
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,500
erosion but if they changed what we grow

835
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,939
we change the practices we're going to

836
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,690
start looking like the west and south of

837
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,070
here

838
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,420
going Weston's house this would be

839
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:59,399
really important but we don't need to

840
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,259
irrigate still it wasn't really

841
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,970
insightful to know that oh you can even

842
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,430
improve what we're doing in that region

843
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,019
right there and then because we had

844
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,250
access to the soils we started asking

845
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:10,200
some other questions too so Aaron

846
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,200
Menzies who's a doctoral student working

847
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,370
with hi Walter in US and ve started

848
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,590
looking she's very interested in

849
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,689
nutrient pollution and used the tally

850
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:20,339
per shell soils as the basis to say well

851
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,160
what happens to like if we want to

852
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:24,869
fertilize can the woodchips affect how

853
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,930
much nutrients leach out of this system

854
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:30,029
and she did an experiment and she looked

855
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,730
at liquid fertilizers dry fertilizers

856
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,759
incorporated service or fertilizers and

857
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:38,069
compared with no chips with chips and

858
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,500
how much nitrogen and phosphorus leach

859
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:41,879
out of the system giving the chips

860
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,130
what's the role so that's her kind of

861
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,990
the basis for her thesis and she's also

862
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,820
really starting to look into this issue

863
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,440
of what's the mechanism so they've come

864
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:50,879
up with a really clever idea of using

865
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,620
rubber mulch which i think it's like

866
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,720
disgusting but you can buy it although i

867
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:57,419
get egg weigh bags and rubber mulch from

868
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,339
tires but it's basically it's wood chips

869
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,710
only its rubber chips so they don't

870
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:03,539
absorb water so we're gonna do some

871
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,700
experiments using rubber chips versus

872
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,079
wood chips I'm trying get a better hand

873
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,279
on what these mechanisms are and that's

874
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:14,159
what she's doing as part of her

875
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:16,230
dissertation ok so that's kind of the

876
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,980
core program of what we've been doing

877
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,930
but there's these other pieces to it all

878
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,130
right one and this is what I said the

879
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,370
benefits of an ecological perspective

880
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,840
it's

881
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:29,609
when we're over there every morning

882
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,159
there's condensation due when all the

883
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:33,839
cars we're probably I don't know several

884
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,450
miles away from the Yellow River and

885
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,589
this is a desert guys and we said well

886
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,500
wait a minute if there's condensation

887
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:42,209
everybody reports water availability has

888
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,980
inches of rain centimeters of rain but

889
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,289
maybe this can make a difference so we

890
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,200
did an experiment growing three kinds of

891
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,639
grass prairie grasses under controlled

892
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,259
conditions we're weighing them at night

893
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,150
weighing them in the morning seeing how

894
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:55,650
much water condensed putting lintel and

895
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,780
so they couldn't convince any water and

896
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,240
basically again I'm giving you a very

897
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,889
short synopsis of things through

898
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,429
condensation each night the grass is

899
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:07,320
captured 23% up to one case 46% of the

900
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:09,690
water they lost in daily transpiration

901
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,119
we also showed in a different small

902
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,148
study that they reduce the evaporative

903
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,469
loss at night that's really important

904
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:18,299
when you're talking 170 hundred eighty

905
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,279
millimeters a year you know in the

906
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,879
growing season being able to capture

907
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,769
water through do is really key now grass

908
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,029
is the most exciting part to me grasses

909
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:30,179
are really cool cuz they're all these

910
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,710
comp dense stems they're perfectly if

911
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,720
you think that's like a forest of stems

912
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,750
which you Wow how do they

913
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,148
photosynthesize no the point is they can

914
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:42,090
capture water it can run down it doesn't

915
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:43,888
evaporate they're evolved to capture you

916
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,210
we don't even think about that that

917
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,610
means if you don't have a grassland

918
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,230
you've lost a key mechanism that wasn't

919
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:52,139
critical to the system's ability to

920
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,190
capture and hold moisture it means you

921
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,169
really got to think about what you're

922
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,230
gonna grow if you restore that system

923
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:00,359
and so as an ecologist at guys we got to

924
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,400
get grasses growing back in there we're

925
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,920
doing some work with what species in

926
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,660
northern China Agra piranha Mungo Lakota

927
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm learning grasses but we can

928
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:11,489
definitely improve grass growth there's

929
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,900
difficulties getting them started but

930
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:16,529
once we get them up and running we can

931
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:20,820
get more breasts to grow all right a

932
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:22,320
second area and and this is me I've been

933
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,410
arguing this one all along and I'll keep

934
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,180
going is it's about the ingredients of

935
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:29,039
the recipe what do you put in it and

936
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:30,989
right now it's coarse woodchips a little

937
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,119
bit of fertilizer that's a lot of work

938
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:34,949
that Jaedong did me to fertilizer the

939
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,710
pure sands doesn't have anything in them

940
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:39,480
but I am arguing well guys we can put

941
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,380
all this stuff in and so recently

942
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,579
there's been a lot

943
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,490
attention on the fact that wood

944
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,170
decomposes at different rates so if you

945
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:48,539
think about it it's like I say iceberg

946
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,849
lettuce disappears in a week but one's

947
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:55,199
really vary and so we used populist

948
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:57,000
remedies Aspen that 50% corn the k.k

949
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,889
rates about one to two years we

950
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,360
definitely noticed by 2015 we were

951
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:02,579
losing our wood was disappearing this

952
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,260
wood chips and experimenting either

953
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,059
needs to be right your vital eyes but we

954
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,710
don't have quite what we had but there

955
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,259
are bunches the species that decompose

956
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,179
very slowly black locust is the one I'm

957
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,310
familiar with farmers will tell you when

958
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:17,429
I put fence posts in put in black locust

959
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:19,799
it'll last for 80 years it doesn't think

960
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:21,569
so what happens if we used that would

961
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,269
what could it do in our restoration

962
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,700
recipe this issue of carbon

963
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:29,639
sequestration is key for mitigating

964
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:31,079
climate change Ratan Lau and a bunch of

965
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,230
people have put out estimates of where

966
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,809
can we do use grasslands as a key for

967
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,300
rest for dealing with carbon and so

968
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:41,309
restoration is a piece of it people

969
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,990
haven't done much with it we argue well

970
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:45,869
you could put black locust into the

971
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:47,549
recipe we had an undergrad honor student

972
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:50,279
Mary Ellen Garcia one of your guys you

973
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,830
might more she was great and we did some

974
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,350
simple static alkali chambers quantified

975
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:57,869
co2 production from control we used to

976
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:59,880
tally precious oil with the with out

977
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:02,549
populous chips and with without locust

978
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,780
chips and for sure and then we had a

979
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,430
whole bunch of different treatments but

980
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,800
this one had nitrogen fertilizer

981
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:11,940
attitude but basically locust same

982
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,789
amount decomposed put out less co2 then

983
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,679
the populace and so we are you you can

984
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:21,239
add locusts to the recipe and we can

985
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:23,190
sequester carbon how much so a 10% vind

986
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,959
a volume amendment would give you 1.7

987
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,179
kilograms of carbon for each square

988
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,490
meter point two meters deep at seventeen

989
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,960
thousand kilograms per hectare of carbon

990
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:34,019
sequestered it would take you 20 trees

991
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,090
50 cent 15 centimeters tbh it's not that

992
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:39,239
big a deal it's not that much

993
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:41,100
i I'm convinced over this areas we're

994
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:42,389
talking about we could do a credible

995
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:45,299
amount of carbon sequestration that'll

996
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:48,480
sit there for a long time the third

997
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,260
piece started two summers ago mainly

998
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,490
because the change

999
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,050
and said well what would this do for

1000
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:53,339
saline soils and we were kind of

1001
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,590
overwhelmed but okay let's see what we

1002
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,360
can come up with and we said all right

1003
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,820
we'll do a test of the wood chips and

1004
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,860
we're gonna because this if they're flat

1005
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,269
all that salts accumulating has to be

1006
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,039
irrigated but we'll put it in a ridge

1007
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:07,530
and furrow system with irrigation along

1008
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,750
the top put wood chips in it this is

1009
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,140
what the soils look like these guys we

1010
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,119
work with these work big so there's

1011
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:17,489
about 10 acres of this set up these are

1012
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,199
the ridge this is the drip irrigation

1013
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:23,569
tube this is the woodchips that's what

1014
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:27,269
it looked like and we went back and

1015
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,830
there was with no amendment and they

1016
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:31,320
were starting things up there

1017
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:34,259
this is goji berry as a endemic as

1018
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,730
native to this area and so there's what

1019
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,950
it looks like in the salty soil even

1020
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,960
with drip irrigation and this is what it

1021
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:42,960
looks like in five months they had a

1022
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,610
complete crop of sunflowers and goji

1023
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,579
berry it's a shrub so it took a bit a

1024
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,289
little bit longer so it's like oh now we

1025
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,969
don't know if it's diluting the salt we

1026
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:52,860
don't know it's bonding to the salt with

1027
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,969
through cation exchange capacity you

1028
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,039
don't know the mechanisms

1029
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:58,289
there's tons of more questions that have

1030
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,519
to be asked but it definitely suddenly

1031
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:01,739
took this land now it's using the

1032
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,960
irrigation which I'm trying not to do

1033
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,449
that but still they need to feed people

1034
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,460
and so suddenly this land that was

1035
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:12,269
totally unusable it's now being put into

1036
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:14,429
production so where we are right now the

1037
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:17,539
most recent work it's back at that

1038
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:19,409
original issue of what's the goal and

1039
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:23,070
how do you get there

1040
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:25,559
and so I was like enough working with

1041
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,539
Harold and then Kerstin and there's this

1042
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,570
whole your whole new initiators to look

1043
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,860
at soil holistically and like for

1044
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,630
farmers not just well what's your

1045
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,910
nutrient status NPK here add some

1046
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,200
fertilizer but you how healthy is the

1047
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:41,819
soil and it's taken across the world

1048
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,710
it's using this this is the way we're

1049
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,019
going it was a holistic look at all

1050
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,130
different properties active carbon all

1051
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,630
different ways of thinking about the

1052
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,750
looking at the soil and we said well

1053
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:54,090
that's perfect it gives us a diagnostic

1054
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,309
tool to look at a degraded grass on Sol

1055
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,350
and say what's there and then what does

1056
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:00,150
it need and so we're saying oh we're

1057
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:01,679
going to use that as this the basis of

1058
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,108
the assessment and diagnosis of these

1059
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,169
degraded soils and

1060
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:07,608
then help us to determine the recipe so

1061
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,108
we went to that we're starting in the

1062
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:11,028
tall grass prairies which are the

1063
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:12,409
richest wettest of what I could tell

1064
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:15,349
mullah Sol's the ones that are in the

1065
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:16,788
greatest shape everything on West gets

1066
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:20,599
drier gets a little bit more confusing

1067
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:22,160
this should be the best and a Kirsten

1068
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:24,559
has joined the graduate program my

1069
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,268
department and working with us right now

1070
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,009
she's a master student and we went out

1071
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:31,179
this fall and collect in August and

1072
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:34,369
collected soils from Relic prairies and

1073
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:37,578
in an adjacent field agricultural field

1074
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:40,160
as a comparison we have about 300

1075
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:41,930
samples from five different pairs and a

1076
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,219
couple of interesting take-home message

1077
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,960
and so that's what she'll be doing it's

1078
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:47,748
the basis of her master's doing the soil

1079
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,329
health analysis holistically and then

1080
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:51,919
saying okay we know what it is it'll be

1081
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:54,769
interesting to see what how it compares

1082
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,079
to the AG what would we do to restore

1083
00:40:54,768 --> 00:40:58,308
this and then we're going to go west and

1084
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,160
start looking at like in North Dakota

1085
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:05,420
and further but one of the interesting

1086
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:07,429
things came out of this was um one it

1087
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,200
wasn't so easy to find like virgin

1088
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:11,568
Prairie now they may still be there but

1089
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,389
what we found as little remnants in the

1090
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:15,829
back of somebody's farm who didn't want

1091
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:18,048
to it wasn't good enough to grow things

1092
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:20,509
on there were a few that were being

1093
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:22,429
preserved but they were still actually

1094
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:24,199
not they were still hanging them or

1095
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:25,879
having livestock use them even in

1096
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:27,919
preserve and it came down to well

1097
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,079
they're not really virgin

1098
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,159
they weren't tilled as far as anybody

1099
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,440
can remember that's what I've come up

1100
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,899
with what's available out there hasn't

1101
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,470
been tilled in our memory that's the

1102
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,170
definition and so it's kind of this

1103
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:43,939
issue of well what what's the ideal

1104
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,579
what's the what did they used to look

1105
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,528
like we did a kind of informal census

1106
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:50,150
just for fun and talking to people you

1107
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:51,710
know a restaurants hey you know this is

1108
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,019
tall grass prairies best souls in the

1109
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:58,338
world and how many would a prairie or

1110
00:41:54,018 --> 00:42:00,078
grassland was and curse it was like six

1111
00:41:58,338 --> 00:42:02,690
of nine did not even know what those

1112
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,430
words meant and they were in when you're

1113
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,739
there all you see is cornfield a few

1114
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:07,909
Slough that's it for you know hundreds

1115
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:09,318
of miles were driving it's like oh my

1116
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:11,149
god this is nothing but cornfield and

1117
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:15,139
they had forgotten they didn't even know

1118
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:16,910
anything Wow even the scientists don't

1119
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:19,269
we work with don't really

1120
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:22,699
Oh what these should look like and so

1121
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:24,559
what the ideal I mean this may be the

1122
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:26,239
best we get for what an idealist we're

1123
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,309
gonna go again in the spring and sample

1124
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,439
more North and North Dakota and South

1125
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:32,179
Dakota of tall grass prairies it'll be

1126
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,099
interesting to see maybe this is the

1127
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:38,149
best that currently exists but it's not

1128
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:40,219
what it used to be you don't know we've

1129
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,780
gotten some publications out we're

1130
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:44,659
finally getting those out we've had some

1131
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,880
real good achievements we gave it round

1132
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:47,679
a special session at the snow Science

1133
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,200
Society list

1134
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:54,049
2016 we've been cut designated as the

1135
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:57,799
flagship project by China for this USDA

1136
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:59,480
the most program we put in and once you

1137
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,400
actually agreed to collaborate for this

1138
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,679
global hundred million dollar global

1139
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,619
challenge last year we made the top 200

1140
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,730
honorable mention think it's Hungarian

1141
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,929
and we were listed as one of the top

1142
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,760
three most collaborative programs

1143
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:14,059
between the United States and China so

1144
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,340
we have we feel good about it there's so

1145
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:19,489
much we don't know don't understand but

1146
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:22,010
it shows great promise it's parts of it

1147
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:24,529
work really well so I'm open to

1148
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:27,380
questions and again I'm hoping I'm

1149
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,180
stimulating I mean maybe you all know

1150
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,099
all this you know maybe it's you know

1151
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:33,019
I'm coming from a different direction

1152
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:36,199
but hopefully if you think of things you

1153
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:38,900
want to talk about email me any thoughts

1154
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:40,730
even the whole interpretation of that

1155
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,740
epiphany for me that whole world used to

1156
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,349
be grasslands and it's all AG that's all

1157
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:47,479
degraded what the heck happened you know

1158
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:50,750
that I mean maybe teach this in 101 I

1159
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:56,900
don't know so thank you very much

1160
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:56,900
[Applause]

1161
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:21,710
yeah micro grab the nitrogen that you

1162
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,730
can pose which it's wondering how that

1163
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:28,278
works okay so interestingly our first

1164
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,929
paper we put together a literal one

1165
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:32,960
there's not that many studies that I've

1166
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:34,399
actually looked at would in soil it's a

1167
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,199
lot of times they'll call me Ben green

1168
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,599
compost where and it's a mixture of

1169
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,278
things not well designated and they've

1170
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,380
seen conflicting results about whether

1171
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:44,568
you get nitrogen amylose immobilization

1172
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,990
in the soil in the experiment you're

1173
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:49,759
going did we saw nitrogen drop we did

1174
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:51,969
but it's not clear-cut that it always

1175
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:54,139
happens in the literature it maybe

1176
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:55,909
that's why for the recipe you're gonna

1177
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:59,538
have to add a little fertilizer we don't

1178
00:44:55,909 --> 00:45:01,759
know that but it's we're adding very so

1179
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:04,309
in that issue when I'm done the review

1180
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:08,409
see it iron ratio varies let's say one

1181
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:10,810
to 21 to 15 one to 10 for woods

1182
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:12,489
it's all dust in the four papers I read

1183
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:14,590
is one to five five hundred to one

1184
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:18,509
carbon and nitrogen five hundred to one

1185
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:20,950
from told us why I don't even get it so

1186
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:23,170
species really different we're trying to

1187
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:25,329
understand why does Locust take 80 years

1188
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,130
to compose maybe you're not going to get

1189
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:29,049
nitrogen immobilization it's a slow

1190
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,200
decomposing would maybe IRAs are so

1191
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:34,780
coarse that actually the the bacteria

1192
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:37,750
function is slowed down I don't know but

1193
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,950
it's not as clear-cut as people think

1194
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,940
when you're working with coarse wood

1195
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:44,859
from what I can tell from the literature

1196
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,510
but believe me I'm paying close

1197
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,160
attention we're trying to and if anybody

1198
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,560
gets why I sold us is five hundred to

1199
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,059
one I mean you know they do these states

1200
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,469
where they add sugar to see if

1201
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:55,079
respiration increases will put in

1202
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:58,149
sawdust that's five hundred to one I

1203
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,769
don't like what kind of salt what are

1204
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,509
you using you know what is that I don't

1205
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:09,398
know

1206
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:11,648
sawdust is mostly you know mostly yeah I

1207
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:13,179
know but even still when I look at the

1208
00:46:11,648 --> 00:46:15,668
literature from xylem versus the other

1209
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:17,979
parts of the bark it's not five hundred

1210
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:20,348
to one you know I don't know whether the

1211
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:23,048
fine scale of it and they're actually

1212
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:24,969
getting backed I don't know but that's

1213
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:25,929
what you know the literature we put it

1214
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:29,289
together that's what I got out of

1215
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:31,358
literature but the CDN immobilization

1216
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:49,689
issue is on the table it's something we

1217
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:51,098
have to think about okay right that is

1218
00:46:49,688 --> 00:46:55,058
the question everybody keeps saying oh

1219
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,789
all right so in China about 20 years ago

1220
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:00,819
they because of erosion they set up a

1221
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:03,339
program of planting trees across all the

1222
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,498
roads it's all populist Alaba it may be

1223
00:47:03,338 --> 00:47:08,288
one individual problems have everywhere

1224
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:10,538
so working with this variants eventual

1225
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:12,519
person we said look just give us every

1226
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,659
third tree and grow something else and

1227
00:47:12,518 --> 00:47:15,129
it's all on the highway they're easily

1228
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:17,528
cut you can cut it bring it and so

1229
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:19,659
there's a lot of wood available and it

1230
00:47:17,528 --> 00:47:21,068
needs to be diversified for a bunch of

1231
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:24,639
setting you know vulnerability and also

1232
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:28,239
we have access to that like coming out

1233
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,818
here there's hardwoods along creek beds

1234
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:34,148
and all but I ultimately you might have

1235
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:36,219
to grow for me black locust row at near

1236
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:37,538
the farm fields but it's a sequestering

1237
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:39,249
carbon while you do it you can actually

1238
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:41,528
copy sit and the same with the poppies

1239
00:47:39,248 --> 00:47:44,708
you can cut it keep it growing and have

1240
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:45,759
a source but for me people Oh nobody

1241
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:49,388
would do that that would cost so much

1242
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:51,789
money bring it in on trucks the reality

1243
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:53,318
is like they put a bridge in the air

1244
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:54,849
house that has 20 homes there are two

1245
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:56,829
other roads people can take and one

1246
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:59,229
other bridge it cost some two million

1247
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:00,609
dollars for one bridge to 20 homes and I

1248
00:47:59,228 --> 00:48:02,018
thought you give me 1 million dollars

1249
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:04,449
see how much wood I can move across the

1250
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:07,928
country how much land I can restore in

1251
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:10,298
South Dakota it's it's really nothing

1252
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:12,159
one time and four years later we're

1253
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:14,318
still having benefits from the wood and

1254
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,369
if you grow grass and you give it four

1255
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,590
years to actually star

1256
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:18,940
get up and running then it's Equestria's

1257
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,430
carbon that's why people keep saying

1258
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,470
grassland sequester carbon once they're

1259
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:26,109
up and running it's getting them up and

1260
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:28,029
running is the key so growing hedgerows

1261
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:44,230
of black locust and populous or what I'm

1262
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:46,330
thinking and then move it out so I'm an

1263
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,639
ecologist and for quite a while over in

1264
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:50,920
town we can get a grassland back here

1265
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,960
and what they said is listen we have

1266
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,610
five times the population United States

1267
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,869
we don't worry about feeding them next

1268
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,370
year we worry about feeding them

1269
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:58,929
tomorrow this is kind of have to make

1270
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:00,339
food of some kind I'm just telling right

1271
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:04,000
now they'll never have a natural grass

1272
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,440
that's like okay but then I think you

1273
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,449
have to have grasses you don't want to

1274
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,220
irrigate at all I think we can get it to

1275
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:11,139
a grass and not have to and then you

1276
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,579
have options you could be perennial

1277
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:14,920
grains Matt Ryan's talking a little bit

1278
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:17,139
about perennial grains and crimping you

1279
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,329
can have livestock limited raising if

1280
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:21,460
you put the right ones in by olive feel

1281
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:22,840
in the u.s. switchgrass is being used

1282
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,300
which is a native kind of come Berg

1283
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,059
Adams a native grass very common and

1284
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,430
it's a basis for biofuel production so

1285
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:32,049
you have other grass options if you go

1286
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:34,329
to anything but grasses you get this

1287
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:36,400
little going and jump start where you

1288
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:37,539
can grow crops you're gonna end up it's

1289
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,210
gonna degrade again I mean without

1290
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:42,670
having a constant the grass is supplying

1291
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:46,240
the system even the locusts you know it

1292
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:48,970
will start to disappear for them um

1293
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,739
apparently China as of late three years

1294
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:53,109
ago was not into biofuels which is

1295
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:54,729
really interesting what they called

1296
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,410
first generational biofuels but in

1297
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,510
second generation biofuels they're

1298
00:49:56,409 --> 00:50:00,339
starting to consider it I think our

1299
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:03,970
group might be able to convince them to

1300
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,100
start as a way to get plants out on the

1301
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:08,619
landscape which then support birds and

1302
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:11,259
wildlife and I think it's got a role

1303
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:14,319
panagra gaydom or the comparable species

1304
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,500
over there so I want grasses back

1305
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,260
honestly

1306
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,380
for that but that's 26 water you thought

1307
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:27,750
about the implications water staying

1308
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:32,070
there for a long time and recharging so

1309
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:33,929
for Nick Shaw I mean the Yellow River is

1310
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,220
the only source of water and the little

1311
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:36,629
city in the city where and there's 2

1312
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:39,358
million people it's considered almost a

1313
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:41,519
town that's how old people and they are

1314
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:44,519
sucking water out of the river and it

1315
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,690
now runs dry in parts and so try the

1316
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:47,400
government says look you can't take that

1317
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,590
much you can have this much and so the

1318
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,358
alternative is like in India like here

1319
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,369
they're switching to ground water people

1320
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,779
don't understand ground water and so

1321
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:57,750
they're putting Wells everywhere and

1322
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,130
sucking it up and so they don't get how

1323
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:03,900
limited water is there

1324
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:05,608
it's just intriguing to me in theory we

1325
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,530
could get grass is growing and this

1326
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:08,969
whole phenomenon condensation how much

1327
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:12,450
more water you might start to build into

1328
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:13,739
the system and and so there's all this

1329
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,639
pressure for what are being pulled out

1330
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:17,579
of the system

1331
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,469
this would at least maybe buffer some of

1332
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,539
that but until there's a more holistic

1333
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:24,358
look of you know about how the world

1334
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:28,070
uses water that's why to me if we can

1335
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:28,069
just reduce irrigation demand with this

1336
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,179
we were out there didn't mention it but

1337
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:45,000
the what the Chinese government is doing

1338
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:48,809
in terms of vegetation at least at the

1339
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,400
time they have about 2000 people go out

1340
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:52,380
into the desert

1341
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,619
it's with these little white straws in

1342
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:58,800
in the mud 1 and square foot baby

1343
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:02,190
then they put one seedling of a desert

1344
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,839
grass in there and 2,000 people they

1345
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:05,880
only have about 2 months out of the year

1346
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:09,559
that there's enough water for the

1347
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,780
seedling to to even establish itself

1348
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,889
probably 60 70 percent of them died

1349
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,830
anyway

1350
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:20,789
in the subsequent summer begins to

1351
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:22,259
exceed and maybe they cover with no 2000

1352
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:24,420
people they cover maybe public parish

1353
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:27,900
maybe this is all manual they word of

1354
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:30,210
putting all Weis by straws in just to

1355
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:33,119
make the environment slightly less harsh

1356
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:35,099
reduce the wind erosion so they're

1357
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,409
trying-- but I mean you tended a

1358
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:41,069
long-term have that kind of an approach

1359
00:52:37,409 --> 00:52:42,449
I mean it's just the labor needs and so

1360
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,940
they're kind of keeping that up a little

1361
00:52:42,449 --> 00:53:10,649
bit but it's absolutely impossible you

1362
00:52:44,940 --> 00:53:13,050
have to have a much more vision it's an

1363
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:16,260
excellent point again it's the recipe

1364
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,610
you know what is not there and we

1365
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,980
haven't said to you what's the chemistry

1366
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:21,329
of the rainfall maybe you also need to

1367
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,170
add these because you're never going to

1368
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:24,029
get it out of the rain

1369
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,619
we haven't gotten to that okay for what

1370
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,150
it's worth we're just oh it's kind of

1371
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,429
like oh the soil health assessment gives

1372
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,900
us the diagnostic tool to figure out the

1373
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:33,179
ingredients that are needed you know

1374
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,769
that's about where we are and Kirsten

1375
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:36,210
will be you know what we're going to

1376
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:38,820
look at that linkage if that's the right

1377
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,470
way we're really feeling our way a

1378
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:55,470
little bit a little bit for how to do

1379
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:57,359
this but that's a good point so it

1380
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:58,769
didn't do a great job and so he was

1381
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,380
putting it on at the race of farmers now

1382
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:02,699
have very high electrical conductivity I

1383
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,680
don't know where they got I don't know

1384
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:07,769
what happened but we got much lower

1385
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:10,259
growth of the wheat in that less

1386
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:13,400
bacterial development like the info it

1387
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:16,110
didn't help the soil properties as much

1388
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,650
it could be the sewage could be a part

1389
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:21,599
of it but my sense of like I'm postman

1390
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,000
ores they tend to decompose more quickly

1391
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,069
I'm we started this saying leaving these

1392
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,079
stuff in you know eight years from now

1393
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:30,809
that stuff's not gone you're not gonna

1394
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,029
get the replenish it so we haven't again

1395
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:34,769
it's a recipe maybe that's the right

1396
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,960
thing to add to give us a nutrient piece

1397
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:39,210
we need some readily decomposable

1398
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,159
material plus some things that are more

1399
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,829
slow it could be a good part of it I

1400
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,659
know the whole sewage thing

1401
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:47,159
depending on where comes if it's mixed

1402
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:49,019
with industrial ways you have oh then

1403
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,759
the heavy metals I mean home hurries

1404
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:53,789
Oh thing you know oh this is not healthy

1405
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,460
so we didn't start there we actually

1406
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:58,529
felt we needed microbial inoculants so

1407
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,260
Baron I didn't show up but when they

1408
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:03,060
hired actually a geneticist who did an

1409
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,820
entire analysis of genetics of the

1410
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:08,400
school microbial communities and there

1411
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,870
were all the things you find in our

1412
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,190
grasslands are they're at very small

1413
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:12,799
amounts including there's just one

1414
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:15,570
that's unique that's right Ciara

1415
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:19,110
documented native grasslands had this

1416
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:20,940
are dominated by Veruca micro D these is

1417
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,740
the name of the group I don't they

1418
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,900
dominate in healthy grant native

1419
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:28,109
grasslands they're almost gone and they

1420
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,639
were like oh there they are there so we

1421
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:33,150
don't know that we need a microbial

1422
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:35,759
inoculant or a while the soui you know a

1423
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:38,099
compost tea just recommend it could be a

1424
00:55:35,760 --> 00:56:02,430
way to bring that in if we need it not

1425
00:55:38,099 --> 00:56:04,469
there yet these people become good

1426
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:07,289
friends parents close they're really

1427
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:09,239
great at first there was more language

1428
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:10,860
and I didn't learn Chinese I'm trying to

1429
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:13,829
learn the symbols I work visually some

1430
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,599
of the femur looking they spoke it and

1431
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:17,340
they're getting better and better it

1432
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,349
definitely affected our ability to

1433
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,510
function scientifically we would go once

1434
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:23,159
a year sometimes twice we thought we

1435
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:26,010
communicated things one way we come back

1436
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:28,559
well that's you know it's your distance

1437
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:31,140
and all those things affect but what's

1438
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,239
interesting is like this woman's very

1439
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:35,309
influential if we convince them it works

1440
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,019
the Chinese government will just do it

1441
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:40,199
it's like okay everybody we're changing

1442
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:42,360
we're doing this that's how now so it's

1443
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:45,029
actually kind of like the Beijing

1444
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,260
Olympics they had all this algae show up

1445
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,910
where long as sure right before they had

1446
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,350
the boating thing they had 10,000 people

1447
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:50,969
go out with buckets and get rid of it I

1448
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:54,259
mean oh we're doing this you know that's

1449
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:57,548
how and so we could actually change a

1450
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:01,278
very big chunk of landscape

1451
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:02,900
works successful it's so issues like we

1452
00:57:01,278 --> 00:57:04,608
don't know whether and they're worried

1453
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,469
well it's that gonna hurt my crops if

1454
00:57:04,608 --> 00:57:07,909
some bugs gonna show up in there now

1455
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:10,729
it's gonna say oh we haven't looked at

1456
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:11,058
that okay in northern North Dakota oh we

1457
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,428
go

1458
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:14,239
nobody's gonna do that you know how are

1459
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,019
you gonna make them do that they're not

1460
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,759
going to do that you even have to

1461
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:19,008
convince them should putting

1462
00:57:16,759 --> 00:57:21,380
demonstrations provide subsidies

1463
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:22,759
you know the whole schmear it's totally

1464
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,369
it's actually gonna be harder to get it

1465
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:29,418
to happen in the United States you know

1466
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:31,338
that's under underpinning so it's really

1467
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:34,219
interesting there I think we'll make

1468
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:42,199
headway they're buying in here it's

1469
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:45,438
gonna be a slow ebay else yep acting is

1470
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:48,739
just a curiosity so do we think that the

1471
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:51,338
prices are more like competitive in

1472
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:54,469
terms of preventing soil erosion

1473
00:57:51,338 --> 00:57:59,449
compared to like our crops and annual

1474
00:57:54,469 --> 00:58:03,139
plants or shrubs trees okay I think

1475
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:04,759
we're not I'm I'm not there I'm like

1476
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:06,739
learning prairie grasses you know I'm

1477
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:10,579
not a grass for some oh well well in

1478
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:12,679
specialist anyway so but I there's an

1479
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:14,869
awful lot about grasses that is

1480
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:16,699
conducive to preventing erosion these

1481
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:17,989
networks of roots these deep roots

1482
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:20,418
they're there through the winter

1483
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:22,519
they're definitely using tree planting

1484
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:24,078
as a restoration technique over there

1485
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:26,268
but they're here to gain like crazy and

1486
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,909
they don't have that kind of network of

1487
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:30,978
roots a you know for Mossad literally I

1488
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:33,588
don't know enough about the different

1489
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:34,759
species of the grass and so particularly

1490
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:37,728
guys I'm trying to feel what's going on

1491
00:58:34,759 --> 00:58:39,769
in the tropical grasslands they probably

1492
00:58:37,728 --> 00:58:41,718
don't have these organic soils I think

1493
00:58:39,768 --> 00:58:43,399
different grasses that really can handle

1494
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:44,989
dry periods and they go dormant I don't

1495
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,079
know I think you're right I think

1496
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:49,849
grasses are evolved more I'm painting

1497
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,459
than to both the above-ground structure

1498
00:58:49,849 --> 00:58:55,640
and then below ground multiple ways to

1499
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:57,438
deal with not having rainfall but I

1500
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,188
agree I think they're probably helping

1501
00:58:57,438 --> 00:59:00,188
with the whole erosion

1502
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:11,710
all right thank you this has been a

1503
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:16,530
production of Cornell University on the

1504
