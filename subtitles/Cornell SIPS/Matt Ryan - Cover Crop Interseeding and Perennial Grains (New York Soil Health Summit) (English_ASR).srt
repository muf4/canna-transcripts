1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,580
morning everyone my name is Matt Ryan

4
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:12,189
I'm a assistant professor of sustainable

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,349
cropping systems at Cornell and I want

6
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:15,759
to talk with you about two strategies

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:19,089
that I'm working on cover crop

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,710
interceding and perennial greens and I'm

9
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:23,410
really talking about keeping the soil

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,440
covered this is a key strategy for

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,089
improving soil health and so just some

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,220
issues that I'd like to bring up your

13
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:32,558
annual green crop production often

14
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:35,378
degrades so especially when we're using

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:38,289
soil tillage we know that cover crops

16
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:40,268
can help offset this predation and

17
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:43,478
improve soil health but not widely

18
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:45,939
adopted so in New York based on 2014

19
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:48,759
data we're about at 10% adoption of

20
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:52,808
cover crops across all the cropland in

21
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,878
New York so a solution here is cover

22
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:57,338
crop interceding and so you saw a

23
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,488
similar picture earlier this is a cover

24
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:03,369
crop that was drill interceded into

25
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:05,439
between rows of corn and what's really

26
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:07,689
exciting about this is that people have

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,158
been interceding cover crops for a very

28
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,739
long time they've been aerial seeding

29
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,618
broadcast seeding this is a new piece of

30
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,569
equipment that that actually drills the

31
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:19,629
scene improves the seed to soil contact

32
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:21,459
so it makes a small slit and it deposits

33
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:24,310
the seed right into the soil surface

34
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:26,048
there and this is a cover crop mixture

35
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,269
there's a lot of interest and excitement

36
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,130
about cover crop mixtures and so

37
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:32,200
traditionally in New York on when we

38
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:35,140
were cover cropping we would typically

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,189
be limited to cereal rye cereal rye is a

40
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,950
great cover crop this is a standby cover

41
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:43,389
crop it's been used by thousands and

42
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,149
thousands of farmers for a very long

43
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,159
time but it's limited in the functions

44
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:51,009
that it provides it's great for cycling

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,189
nutrients and using it and using it as a

46
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:57,340
touch prop to prevent nutrient leaching

47
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:58,868
but it's that's about all it does it

48
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,359
provides a lot of biomass if you let it

49
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:05,468
grow and so what we're seeing here with

50
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:07,209
cover crop interceding is is that you

51
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:09,280
can actually get legumes established and

52
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,750
so these legumes when you get these

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,669
leggings established and other species

54
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,680
that you typically not be able to see it

55
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:17,199
after a cover crops are or after cash

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,340
crops are harvested in the fall it can

57
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,018
really change the whole

58
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,500
sustainability of your system and

59
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:25,450
increase Oh help dramatically so when we

60
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,000
survey farmers and we talk with farmers

61
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:30,250
they say that not being able to do that

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,229
their number one reason why they do not

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,659
grow cover crops is because they don't

64
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:36,759
have enough time after crop harvest in

65
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,409
the fall and by doing this you can get

66
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,000
that cover crop established on time and

67
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,919
actually grow these different species

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,378
and integrate them into your cropping

69
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,389
systems so very exciting research going

70
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:48,068
on at Cornell and across the u.s. with

71
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:49,750
cover crop interceding and we're now

72
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:52,449
starting to see that they they do have

73
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,030
an impact we are seeing a fairly rapid

74
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,500
response in terms of soil improvement

75
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,229
there's a recent paper that came out was

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,449
showing after just four years with cover

77
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:03,128
crop initiating we're starting to see

78
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,469
indicators improved indicators of soil

79
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:07,179
health so over a very short period of

80
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,859
time we're not necessarily increasing

81
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,599
soil carbon but we're starting to see

82
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,810
these indicators like improved soil

83
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:15,369
respiration increase aggregate stability

84
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,560
increase active carbon you know these

85
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,769
levels are going up so very exciting

86
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,449
research there the other strategy that

87
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,769
I'd like to talk about is perennial

88
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:28,839
grains so all the greens that we eat now

89
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,420
their annual crops right so we we till

90
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,310
and we replant them every year and what

91
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,169
we're trying to do is develop perennial

92
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,699
grain crops these are crops that you

93
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,530
would plant once and then harvest for

94
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,839
multiple years so this is an

95
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,000
illustration here just showing what you

96
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,848
would typically see on on the Left with

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,560
an annual crop production on sloped land

98
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:50,259
where you have some runoff and you're

99
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,139
getting creating some erosion and and

100
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:55,449
water quality challenges by keeping the

101
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:59,019
soil covered okay with a perennial crop

102
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:01,509
or multiple years we're thinking that we

103
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:04,419
can improve water infiltration increased

104
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:06,039
soil soil health and get more of that

105
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,989
water going into the soil and less of it

106
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,780
running off and causing erosion and

107
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,489
water quality problems so in New York

108
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,919
State we're working with the number of

109
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,048
farmers poor organic farmers in

110
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,180
particular that about we're working with

111
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,709
very closely growing some different

112
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,900
perennial grain crops one of them is

113
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,750
called Carranza this is a perennial

114
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:28,839
green I have some seed go right here

115
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,718
it's a very small seed and this is a

116
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,929
crop that is domesticated we're working

117
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,459
with

118
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,030
partners at the land Institute in Kansas

119
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:40,719
also in France and across across the US

120
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:42,159
but this crop um again it's it's it's

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,970
different and all of your other green

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,759
crops it's it's new and so we've taken a

123
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,970
wild plant and have domesticated it and

124
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,100
then through a recurrent selection have

125
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,050
selected for increased seed size and so

126
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,020
um what's really exciting about this is

127
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,970
that right now we're at a tipping point

128
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:04,959
with perennial grain production where

129
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,750
we're seeing large companies become

130
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,339
interested in turns up for increasing

131
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,889
their sustainability of their operations

132
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:13,629
so one company is Patagonia provisions

133
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,598
this is Patagonia the clothing company

134
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:20,139
they've started a line a food line and

135
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:22,149
they've started to offer a beer called

136
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,699
long route ale that's grown with are

137
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:27,478
made with trends oh that's 15 percent

138
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,750
currency in it and now General Mills

139
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:33,008
Cascadian farms is very interested and

140
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,779
integrating currency into their product

141
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,970
lines they have a new cereal that would

142
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:39,549
be coming out this October that has

143
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,169
occurrences in it and so I'm really

144
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,110
exciting stuff happening right now in

145
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:46,509
New York with our farmers we're into our

146
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,650
second year of harvesting again the

147
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:49,629
yields are low we're having some

148
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:52,149
challenges with harvesting this is a new

149
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,579
crop unlike all the other annual grains

150
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:57,279
that are completely dry when you go to

151
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,899
harvest this one is still a bit green so

152
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,089
actually getting through the combine and

153
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:03,219
working out some of these logistical

154
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:04,779
challenges mechanical problems is what

155
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,729
we're focused on we're also very

156
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,439
interested in developing agronomic

157
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,300
recommendations trying to figure out

158
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,529
when you should see this what your

159
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,689
seeding rate should be what your

160
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:15,969
fertility management should be so that's

161
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,098
all part of this research that we're

162
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,659
doing and you can see on the the far

163
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:23,319
right there this is a picture of the

164
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:29,649
root of this crop so on the on the Left

165
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:32,469
here the preen

166
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:34,689
green turns I and it has that extensive

167
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,850
root system and so that's one of the

168
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:38,228
reasons why it's in addition to keeping

169
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,509
the soil covered that's another reason

170
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:43,538
why it we think that it can have a major

171
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,370
impact and improve soil health so like I

172
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,620
said I think this is an up-and-coming

173
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,600
crop there's still more work to be done

174
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,459
but I keep an eye out for this and I'm

175
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:58,600
happy to talk more about this we have

176
00:06:51,459 --> 00:07:00,698
time later so thank you very much this
