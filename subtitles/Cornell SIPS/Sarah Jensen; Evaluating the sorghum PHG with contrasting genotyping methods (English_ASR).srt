1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,039
so I'm going to start out and remind you

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:16,039
about what I talked about last year

5
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:19,009
which was also the practical haplotype

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,259
graph and so last year I talked a lot

7
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:24,140
about building the practical haplotype

8
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:27,079
graph in sorghum and how we were trying

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,689
to use it in a breeding program which is

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,939
run by guile press WA and based in

11
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,039
port-au-prince Haiti okay

12
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,649
and so we've used the practical

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,500
haplotype graph in that program for

14
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:41,329
genomic selection a couple times now and

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,158
in the last year really one of the

16
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,378
things that we've done is we've tested

17
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:48,018
the practical haplotype graph with

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,670
different genotyping methods and so

19
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:53,088
today actually what I wanted to talk to

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,010
talk about is how we've tested the pH G

21
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:56,899
and share some of those genotyping

22
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:02,719
methods and the results with and without

23
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:04,459
the practical haplotype graph ok so to

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,170
start out we have our nice genomic

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,349
selection scheme on the right here and

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,118
in any GS scheme we have this point

27
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:14,419
where we need to genotype the progeny

28
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,938
population and we have a lot of options

29
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,670
for genotyping and so this list on the

30
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:22,158
less left is absolutely not an

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,099
exhaustive list but it does list some of

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,310
the possibilities that we have but

33
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:30,530
really what we want is a technology

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,868
that's going to be cheap it's going to

35
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,939
be fast and we also really want a

36
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:37,968
technology that's fairly easy to use

37
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:40,669
both across breeding programs and also

38
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:43,459
across species and so when we start to

39
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,819
subset down this list based on those

40
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:48,048
criteria we can actually cross out a lot

41
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,030
of the things that are on this list to

42
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,999
begin with but two of the ones that are

43
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,239
left are are a champ seek or ramp seek

44
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:58,818
and skim sequencing and so these are two

45
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,589
genotyping methods that I have used with

46
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,269
the practical haplotype graph and so

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,149
that's what I'm gonna be presenting for

48
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:08,060
you guys today

49
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,919
now last year I put up a slide and I

50
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,990
said okay the practical haplotype graph

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,719
is really designed to be an imputation

52
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,129
tool and so it's been designed to work

53
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,590
with a lot of different types of

54
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,939
sequence data and I use GBS as an

55
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,460
example of that

56
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,949
I put up GPS data and I showed okay we

57
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,590
can use GPS for genomic selection in

58
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,989
guiles breeding program and we can also

59
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,569
use that same sequence deep data with

60
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,909
the practical haplotype graph in Geils

61
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:37,159
breeding program so this year I'm not

62
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,620
going to show you GPS data with the

63
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,259
practical haplotype graph but I am going

64
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,990
to use that GPS data as our baseline we

65
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:46,579
know that gb/s is a really an effective

66
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,140
technology and so we're always trying to

67
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,580
get prediction accuracies with new

68
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,089
technologies that are at least

69
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,150
equivalent to that okay so I'll start

70
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,310
actually by talking about skin sequence

71
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,319
and when I talk about skin sequence what

72
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,300
I'm really talking about is a protocol

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,060
that was designed by NextEra and

74
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,370
essentially they take a TN v transpose

75
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,650
ace that jumps into the genome at

76
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,379
different positions randomly across the

77
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,960
entire genome and then we sequence out

78
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:18,139
from those positions and so that gives

79
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,360
us a very sparse initial data set and

80
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:24,169
it's also completely random so we're not

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,830
capturing one specific or consistent

82
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:29,750
marker set with this technology but it

83
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,030
is really cheap it cost less than $10

84
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,530
per sample and so it is a viable option

85
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,250
or something that we'd like to be able

86
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,930
to use with with a breeding program and

87
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,539
so the question at the bottom then

88
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,340
becomes does imputation with the

89
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:47,539
practical haplotype graph make it

90
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,310
possible to use this technology so I'm

91
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,049
gonna put up this slide first this is a

92
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,019
plot very similar to one I showed you

93
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:56,390
last year and both in this plot and in

94
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,849
plots for the rest of my talk if the if

95
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,609
the box is blue its GBS data so that's

96
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:03,799
just the baseline okay GBS works well

97
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,540
for prediction accuracy in Gaia's

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,550
program now if I add in boxes for that

99
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:13,159
next Arace skim sequence data that's

100
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,530
those green boxes on the bottom and you

101
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,899
can see that yes this technology is less

102
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,668
than $10 per sample but it's not giving

103
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,310
us anything it's completely useless for

104
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,409
prediction okay and that really comes

105
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,600
down to the fact that because this is

106
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,160
based on random sequencing there's no

107
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,870
consistency there's no overlap in

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,300
positions that were we're actually

109
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,840
sequencing and so this is where the

110
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,780
practical haplotype graph can come

111
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,399
if we take that sequence data and we run

112
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:41,069
it through the phg to impute missing

113
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,199
information we actually get these dark

114
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,699
green boxes here and so you can see that

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,709
the practical haplotype graph is

116
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,990
actually helping us to restore that

117
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,779
prediction accuracy and we can get an

118
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,918
equivalent prediction accuracy

119
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:55,259
approximately the same number of markers

120
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,168
as we would have with GPS and we can do

121
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,089
it at half the cost and so the answer to

122
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:01,769
the question then is yes with skim

123
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:03,929
sequencing we can use the practical

124
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:07,019
haplotype graph for effective genomic

125
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,750
selection so the second technology is

126
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:11,909
ramp seek or are a champ seek this is an

127
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,829
amplicon based sequencing method and it

128
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,080
targets specific regions so it does give

129
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:17,399
you fewer markers but it's offered as a

130
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,740
service by a couple different companies

131
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,359
and that means it's very little work for

132
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,900
breeders to use and so we like it for

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,710
that reason

134
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,810
and so ramp seek when we put up a plot

135
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:30,209
like this you see that using ramp Sikma

136
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,040
positions or amplicons on their own

137
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,810
actually works really well

138
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,930
we're already about the same level as

139
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,240
GPS with this light purple those light

140
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,788
purple boxes and I do want to point out

141
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,009
that this is targeting about 2000 Llosa

142
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:46,139
across the genome and they've been

143
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,889
designed specifically for sorghum but

144
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,629
not specifically for guiles program okay

145
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,949
now when we take that sequence data and

146
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,500
we run it through the practical

147
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,149
haplotype graph we get these dark purple

148
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,220
boxes and that doesn't look so good

149
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,509
because you can see we're not improving

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,630
our prediction accuracy we're actually

151
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,879
really decreasing them and so that tells

152
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,159
us two things the first is that in Geils

153
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,899
program the 2,000 markers that we're

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,870
capturing with our a champ seek is

155
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,370
enough to do effective genomic selection

156
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,829
and the second thing is it's telling us

157
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,939
that with this technology right now the

158
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:23,279
practical applicable Andamanese and so

159
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,649
this is something that actually the

160
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,719
programmers have been have changed

161
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,219
actually how we're imputing these

162
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,260
genotypes and so in the next couple

163
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,570
months I'll be looking at if those

164
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,750
changes have actually improved this kind

165
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:38,339
of plot but the answer right now is that

166
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,839
no with ramp seek the practical

167
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,589
haplotype graph doesn't really help us

168
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:46,228
and isn't really necessary at all so

169
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,439
that brings us to this nice point where

170
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:48,849
we have

171
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,850
a couple different options for

172
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,710
genotyping and the option that a breeder

173
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,870
chooses really should be designed or

174
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,000
should be chosen based on both their

175
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,399
breeding goals and the budget that

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,870
they're willing to spend so I'm going to

177
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,299
build this plot a little bit up on the

178
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,670
right here on the x-axis we have the

179
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,050
number of snips it only goes to 3,000

180
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,509
but you can imagine we could extend that

181
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,660
fairly significantly and then on the

182
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,610
y-axis we have costs per sample okay so

183
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,439
I'll be plotting data that comes from a

184
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,270
group Lex genomics that's one of the

185
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,930
companies that produces this are a champ

186
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:25,389
seek amplicon based sequencing and as I

187
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,759
plot those I've also colored hopefully

188
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,279
you can see it okay the background of

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,339
this plot to show you at that location

190
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,489
in the graph what is our best sequencing

191
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:38,769
option cost wise okay and so just as an

192
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,439
example if we had a point where this X

193
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:43,629
is on the screen that means we want more

194
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,019
than 2,000 markers and we're willing to

195
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,819
pay more than $15 per sample and so GBS

196
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:51,599
is a good genotyping strategy in that

197
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:55,659
particular case does that make sense

198
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,910
great so let's add some data if we start

199
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,500
adding data we can see that if we're

200
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,600
working in a species that has a lot of

201
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,910
breeding efforts going on maybe we

202
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,650
expect that across all breeding programs

203
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,660
there could be 80,000 or even a hundred

204
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,329
thousand individuals that are being

205
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,160
genotyped then we're following the blue

206
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:14,769
and purple lines on this plot and

207
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,650
actually are a champ seek is going to be

208
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,449
our best bet we can get about 2,000

209
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,449
markers from our a champ seek and we're

210
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,149
still under that $10 per sample goal

211
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,009
that we'd like to be hitting if we're

212
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,259
working in a species that has more

213
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:32,379
moderate breeding efforts maybe we have

214
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,418
10,000 or 25,000 samples that we expect

215
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,809
to be genotyped then we're following the

216
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:39,728
orange and green lines on this plot and

217
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,859
we can really decide between ramp seek

218
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,590
and skim sequencing with the practical

219
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,990
haplotype graph both will give us a cost

220
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,580
effective option for genotyping and we

221
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,440
really want to be paying attention then

222
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,060
to how many markers we need because the

223
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,510
cost for a thousand markers is fairly

224
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:57,189
equivalent and then last if we're

225
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:59,200
working in a small breeding program

226
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,190
we're following the red line here and

227
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,560
skim sequence with the practical

228
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,530
photograph is really going to be the

229
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:10,339
most effective option for us in this

230
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:13,069
case I also want to point out that the

231
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,870
data from all right from Agri Plex only

232
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,730
goes up to two thousand markers but I

233
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,710
sort of tried to extrapolate out from

234
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,710
that and that's what the dotted lines on

235
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,720
this plot are and so if you extrapolate

236
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,030
out if you need more than two thousand

237
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,620
markers either for your breeding program

238
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,860
or because you want to be doing other

239
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,230
genomic analyses then something like GBS

240
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,210
or skim sequencing with the practical

241
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,680
haplotype graph is going to be a really

242
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:42,139
good option for you so that gets us back

243
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,239
to our original question when is the

244
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:47,689
practical haplotype graph most useful

245
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,460
and the answer is one if we're working

246
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,890
in a species that has fairly small

247
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,190
breeding efforts the pH G can help get

248
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:56,990
us cost-effective genotyping another is

249
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,120
that if we're working in medium or large

250
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,039
breeding programs but we want more than

251
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,139
a thousand or two thousand markers the

252
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,549
pH G can also help fill in some of that

253
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,370
marker information that we might want

254
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:10,159
and then the third is if we're working

255
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,080
in a breeding program or set of programs

256
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,209
and we want to have a consistent set of

257
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,070
snips the practical haplotype graph can

258
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,750
actually output a consistent snip set

259
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,350
and so that can help with that kind of

260
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,909
consistency as well if we need it so I

261
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,040
am about out of time hopefully I've

262
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:26,629
convinced you that the pH G does have

263
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,699
you its uses and we have used it

264
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,139
effectively in Geils breeding program

265
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,509
although I don't have time to talk about

266
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:34,220
that here there's a lot of people that

267
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,809
have worked on this and so I do want to

268
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,330
acknowledge everybody in the buckler lab

269
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:40,939
everybody in Geils program at Sheba's

270
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,160
and then Jeff Morris and kabedon Melita

271
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,500
at the Morris lab who have also put a

272
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,969
lot of time into this project but I'm

273
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,799
gonna wrap up so if you guys have

274
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,810
questions I'd be happy to try and

275
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,319
answers those now or we can talk

276
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,899
afterward as well thanks

277
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,460
[Music]

278
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:58,459
[Applause]

279
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,028
good question so the question was all of

280
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,278
the box plots I showed what are the taxa

281
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:18,078
being shown here the same the answer is

282
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,208
yes this is actually all data from the

283
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,578
training population that gaël made and

284
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,258
so there's about 250 taxa in that data

285
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:28,309
set and it's consistent across all of

286
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:34,550
the marker technologies great thanks

287
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:38,149
guys this has been a production of
