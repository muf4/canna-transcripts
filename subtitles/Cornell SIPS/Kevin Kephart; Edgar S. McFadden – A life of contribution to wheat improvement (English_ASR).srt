1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,549
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,549
University

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,599
and I want to thank you for the great

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,480
welcome and the great turnout it's

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,239
really an honor for me to be here Susan

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,219
mentioned that I work for a company

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,618
called indigo egg which is into the

8
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,439
plant microbiome we develop into fights

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,778
for the benefit of crop production we

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,099
also do partnerships with growers and

11
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:31,559
risk mitigation we characterize crops

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,380
that are grown and segregate those and

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,738
try to market that through identity

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:42,090
preservation I mentioned that because my

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:44,209
job with indigo is I head up university

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,480
relationships and partnerships

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:51,268
particularly in my job is to focus on

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,849
those those campuses that are of

19
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:55,858
strategic interest and importance to me

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,109
indigo and Cornell is one of those

21
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:01,050
Cornell I'd say Texas A&amp;M is another

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,910
Kate we do a lot with k-state a lot of

23
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,479
our workers is in wheat and so there's

24
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:09,539
only really a handful of campuses and we

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,640
were a delegation from indigo was here

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,850
last August and we had one-on-one visits

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,069
with folks like dr. McCutchen and others

28
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,199
and we're not just interested in

29
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:22,229
microbiology or the plant microbiome

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,870
because of our interest in segregation

31
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,380
and trying to market and capture greater

32
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,480
value out of crops crop quality

33
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:34,199
utilization food safety food performance

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,969
all of those aspects are important to us

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,180
and that's that's why I'm here this is

36
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,799
my third trip to Ithaca since since last

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,680
August I've been here many many times

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,689
before through the biofuels work but

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,200
it's good to be back and it's good to be

40
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,299
back

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,689
and so thank you for so it's nice

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,549
weather I came here I came here from

43
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,230
Brookings South Dakota I still live in

44
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,359
Brookings and I go to Boston two or

45
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,450
three times a month but my wife's gonna

46
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,549
have 35 below temperatures tonight not

47
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,310
windchill factor that's going to be the

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,399
air temperature so we'll have 50 below

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:14,140
zero a wind chill back home and I won't

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:18,969
be there so so so thank you for that

51
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:21,789
the things that I've done at South

52
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:24,639
Dakota State there's just like any other

53
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,889
institution I imagine there's some very

54
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,579
interesting historical figures that have

55
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,869
had any impact on agriculture

56
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,959
agricultural science and we have our

57
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,569
share of those at South Dakota State as

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,789
well and I'll really do a deep dive on

59
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:44,379
one of them here today that that's Edgar

60
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:46,629
McFadden but there's a couple others as

61
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:49,180
well that I might make mention of and of

62
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,539
course these stories interfere with

63
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,939
other places including New York and

64
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:57,310
Cornell I do want to point out as I get

65
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:59,590
going and developing this story that I

66
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,989
become passionate about and actually a

67
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,819
wake up at night with a new idea on

68
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,590
where to search I've been to Rockefeller

69
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,169
Foundation archives the National

70
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,360
Archives very of many university

71
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:12,639
archives but I've had a partner in that

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,959
and she's in the room Cindy Bartel she

73
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,569
didn't know I was going to introduce her

74
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,539
but Cindy's a postdoc here at Cornell in

75
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:23,889
the Atkinson Center and before she went

76
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:25,599
to grad school she I was able to wrangle

77
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,069
her into helping me out with some of

78
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,109
these searches and Thank You Cindy

79
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:32,319
because a big part of this was was

80
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,860
because of you so thank you thank you so

81
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,590
much

82
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,750
she's just been wonderful to work with

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,930
so let's get into this story and who was

84
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,930
Edgar McFadden and what what type of

85
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,189
advancement and contributions did he I

86
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:51,040
had the word contributions what were his

87
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:52,539
contributions to wheat improvement well

88
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,699
at least where I'm gonna pick up on the

89
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,129
story it written the story begins before

90
00:03:54,699 --> 00:04:00,250
this but I'm gonna pick up on this story

91
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:02,919
in Lisbon New York it's up in st.

92
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,719
Lawrence County just south of the st.

93
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:09,099
Lawrence River it was the first

94
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:11,439
community established in that County in

95
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:13,900
that part of New York I think it was

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,930
1801 or something like that that the

97
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,759
town of Lisbon was created think people

98
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,579
think it was named after Lisbon Portugal

99
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:26,409
but it's actually Liz born or Lisburn

100
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,789
Ireland that it's named after just right

101
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,310
outside

102
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,189
Northern Ireland so an Irish community

103
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,009
in New York

104
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:38,019
James McFadden was born in 1856 there

105
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,659
Lisbon is still there it's about a

106
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:47,319
population of about 4,000 people and he

107
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:51,820
did his he was a college or graduate of

108
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:54,849
Portsmouth Teachers College in in or

109
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:58,360
Potsdam Teachers College in New York so

110
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:02,410
he got his degree and started a career

111
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,870
in in teaching after he got his degree

112
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,710
he left New York and moved to central

113
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,019
Minnesota to begin his teaching career

114
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,699
and he met a young lady there there was

115
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,949
eight years younger that he was and that

116
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,920
was Beatrice they pronounced that

117
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:21,129
Beatrice her name was Beatrice talking

118
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,189
and eventually they were married and

119
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:27,819
they moved in left Minnesota and

120
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:30,009
homesteaded in Dakota Territory Dakota

121
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:33,009
South Dakota was not a state yet but in

122
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:36,579
the mid 1800s they left Minnesota to

123
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,860
homestead in Des County South Dakota and

124
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:41,139
they had a family they had three

125
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,230
children they had Lily Lily was the

126
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:47,259
oldest and ger was the middle child

127
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,750
Edgar sharp McFadden he was really the

128
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,120
tail end child because the brother

129
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:56,079
Clarence died in infancy about eight

130
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,600
which is not an unusual occurrence in

131
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,519
that part of the world this is where

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Dade County went they live just right

133
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,299
outside of Webster South Dakota it's

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,449
going to get down to about 40 degrees

135
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,639
below zero there tonight that's the

136
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:12,729
environment that they were living in and

137
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,949
by the way winners were hard a hundred

138
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:21,759
years ago there as well so the family

139
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:24,539
underwent just tragic hard times for one

140
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,789
reason or another beginning in 1899

141
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:31,450
Clarence died infancy I still don't know

142
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,430
what he he died of but it wasn't an

143
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,709
uncommon thing for people to die as

144
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,569
youngsters

145
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:40,569
at that period of time so that was a

146
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,129
tragedy to the family meanwhile they

147
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,788
were farming they're trying to make a

148
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:48,519
living off of 160 acres of land and in

149
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:50,349
that that part of the world they had a

150
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,448
couple milk cows and they had some

151
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,970
chickens and so Edgar and his dad would

152
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,038
sell milk and cream and egg deliveries

153
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,259
into the town of Webster they lived six

154
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,000
miles out of town so he would be

155
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,419
involved in that with those dairy

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,089
deliveries and he learned the value of

157
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:12,189
hard work and man it was hard work but

158
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:15,250
Edgar was a unique individual and that's

159
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:21,478
a key thing to remember in this talk he

160
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,478
later wrote that by age 13 he had read

161
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:30,990
the work of gosh from having one of my

162
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:35,430
senior moments there right now so so the

163
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:38,288
Mendelian he wrote Gregor Mendel's

164
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,139
work and that wasn't rediscovered

165
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:45,610
remember it was rediscovered in Europe

166
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:47,759
in 1900 so by 1904 Edgar said that he

167
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,830
had reviewed and he was studying

168
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,129
Mendel's work he had already read

169
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:57,728
Darwin's Origin of Species by that age

170
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:59,050
as a very young man now the question

171
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,870
I've had that I haven't been able to

172
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,650
find out is someone living in Webster

173
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:09,129
South Dakota Dade County South Dakota

174
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:12,069
how do you access that that work how do

175
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,689
you get access to that and that's

176
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,300
something that I have yet to figure out

177
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,949
but nevertheless I believe that he did

178
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,180
it I believe a hundred percent I'm

179
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:24,939
convinced that he did it because by 1904

180
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,800
from his review and study of Mendel's

181
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,930
work he was already doing some of his

182
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,379
own selection work out in the field on

183
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:36,879
his own farm in South Dakota he wanted

184
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:39,338
to develop a beardless line of wheat so

185
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:43,708
no Hans and he was going on into fields

186
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,820
and trying to put to the test this this

187
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:48,569
segregate

188
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,220
a week he wasn't doing any crosses or

189
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,420
anything like that or there's always

190
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,740
already making his own population

191
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:58,019
developing his own populations and

192
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,889
studying segregates so he was doing that

193
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,189
on his own as a young man by the time

194
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,569
1904

195
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:09,480
so 1904 comes along and early in that

196
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,220
spring his father was gored by the

197
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,560
family bull so that's kind of a

198
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,720
reflection of what it was like to live

199
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,379
there he wasn't killed but he was

200
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,180
severely injured and it impacted him for

201
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:25,200
the rest of his life so his father was

202
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:29,489
was was injured in 1904 in 1904 they had

203
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,580
a sudden severe stem stem rust epidemic

204
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,399
that reduced their crop by about fifty

205
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,440
to sixty percent and when you're living

206
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,509
in that type of a situation just think

207
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,580
about the economic impact that has on a

208
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:43,980
family in a community in the whole

209
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,060
region so a huge impact there

210
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,340
so Edgar dedicated his life as a young

211
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,039
man trying to do what he could to

212
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,780
understand what he eventually became

213
00:09:53,039 --> 00:10:00,240
that came to know it as as a stem rust

214
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:02,399
the science of stem rust he wanted to

215
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,669
know about wheat and and this whole area

216
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,370
of breeding and genetics and wheat so

217
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:12,779
that intrigued him for the rest of his

218
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:15,060
entire life and so uh what followed up

219
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,549
after that as he was getting on his way

220
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,529
in science on his own remember he had

221
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,769
about of eighth grade education at this

222
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:27,329
period of time 1908 comes around and his

223
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:29,549
older sister Lily at age 19 and then his

224
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:36,180
mother was getting sick so one tragedy

225
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:36,818
after the other so they moved they still

226
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,788
main

227
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:42,728
ownership of the farm in Dade County

228
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:46,028
South Dakota they kept that and they

229
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:47,919
rented it out essentially but the family

230
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:50,438
picked up and moved all three of them

231
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:52,149
and actually they went to Orange County

232
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:54,308
California first to see what they could

233
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,958
see what kind of life they might have

234
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:58,298
there and spent a few months with some

235
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:02,349
relatives out there but ultimately they

236
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:08,588
moved to Ballmer a Texas in this this

237
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:10,749
part of Texas Pecos County 1908 just

238
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,209
north of the Davis Mountains so you can

239
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:15,399
kind of see some topography there that's

240
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:19,118
the Davis Mountains and at that period

241
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,639
of time that was the haunt of Bandidos

242
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:24,129
out of Mexico folks like Pancho Villa

243
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,850
were actually hiding and living and

244
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:29,649
operating in that part of Texas crossing

245
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,288
the Rio Grande River and then they would

246
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,798
come in that deeply into Texas into the

247
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:38,798
Davis Mountains

248
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:41,408
well what Edgar was doing while they

249
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:45,639
lived and tried to maintain this the

250
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:47,438
small cattle ranch down in Texas Edgar

251
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,209
would follow the wheat harvest and bear

252
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:51,248
in mind that there weren't combines at

253
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:54,698
that period of time wheat was harvested

254
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,918
manually its size and it up and then it

255
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:58,719
would be thrashed and so he would follow

256
00:11:56,918 --> 00:12:00,818
that he would become part of these

257
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,829
harvest crews and follow the wheat

258
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:05,858
harvest all the way up into North Dakota

259
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:08,668
every year but given his interest he was

260
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:11,829
paying attention to stem rust spores

261
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:13,928
stem rust infections out in the field

262
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:15,849
what was the morphological stage of

263
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:17,408
maturity of wheat as he was going

264
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,269
through what was the condition of this

265
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:21,999
week and he was taking notes and

266
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:24,668
learning all who all along the way so he

267
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:28,600
was doing that on his own as a young man

268
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:30,838
going from Texas to up into the northern

269
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,839
Great Plains

270
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,039
photograph of Edgar the family had this

271
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:37,480
Kodak camera and they took lots of

272
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,329
pictures and some of those still exist

273
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,269
today so this is a photograph of edy

274
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,790
Kerr it's gonna be about 1908 nine

275
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:47,740
somewhere in that figure down in Texas

276
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:50,110
and see he's got a double-barreled

277
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,289
shotgun there and he's got a six-shooter

278
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,930
sticking in his belt with a with a belt

279
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,639
full of cartridges that he so this is

280
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,979
that this is he would call himself a

281
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,850
range writer and definitely he was a

282
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:07,269
genuine cowboy Texas cowboy during this

283
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,480
period of his of his life that's Edgar s

284
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:13,240
McFadden right there

285
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,720
so what else was going on 100 years ago

286
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,570
during this same period of time we had a

287
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,190
monumental figure in Plant Pathology and

288
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:25,000
we genetics at the University of

289
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,100
Minnesota Elvin statement and there's

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,700
testament to him still on campus I was

291
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,649
just in statement Hall just last week

292
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,960
Elvin Stegman was recognized as the

293
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:39,220
world's global expert on Puck's Tinian

294
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:43,740
at that period of time he established a

295
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:46,450
laboratory for for essentially

296
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,110
epidemiology of these diseases and wheat

297
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:53,379
and other small grains it was also an

298
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,720
advocate for Barbary eradication Barbary

299
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,240
as an alternate host to to Puck's

300
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,790
Indiana's believe that that Barbary was

301
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,560
a source of infection for wheat wheat

302
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:06,939
crop up and down the Great Plains so a

303
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,028
important figure here is Elvin statement

304
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,940
and by the way Elvin Stegman was a major

305
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:16,240
advisor for Norman Borlaug later on in

306
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:20,260
statements career

307
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,950
a couple other figures one that I've

308
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:26,350
developed an even longer talk about and

309
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,300
that's Nils Hanson Mills Hanson was a

310
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,649
professor of horticulture at South

311
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,979
Dakota State University

312
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:35,708
he was the first USDA plant Explorer

313
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,230
hired by Tama James Wilson Secretary of

314
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:40,239
Ag at the turn of the century and he

315
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,509
made six expeditions into Russia to

316
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,028
bring back germ plasm for USDA's planet

317
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,708
introduction system a lot of it was

318
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:49,990
alfalfa he's got a big bundle of

319
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:52,239
Siberian alfalfa there under under his

320
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,740
arm and that's how he looked yet he's

321
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
got a little six-shooter there and his

322
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,769
belt as well with a billy club he liked

323
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:02,829
to pose for pictures but he brought back

324
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,509
a lot of small grains apples still today

325
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,430
a lot of that those introductions and

326
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,970
apples are used today a lot of

327
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:11,409
horticultural crops cabbages cucurbits

328
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,680
you mentioned it

329
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:16,480
alfalfa crested wheatgrass a lot of

330
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,639
those things smooth brown grass were

331
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,970
first introduced by unions handsome and

332
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,850
then Mark Carlton mark Carlton was also

333
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,009
a USDA explorer he hailed out of Kansas

334
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,930
and many of our small grains

335
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:34,950
introductions around the turn century

336
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:37,509
Durham's bread wheats Emmer's rye oats

337
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:42,550
barley those types of things they were

338
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:44,230
introduced by Mark Carlton there was a

339
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:46,120
lot of development in wheat in the

340
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,829
northern Great Plains and Canada during

341
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,899
this period of time and we can't get

342
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:52,149
into all of that but one of the most

343
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:56,009
monumental developments out of Canada

344
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:59,440
out of Ottawa was Marcus wheat

345
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:01,720
Marquess was developed by the Saunders

346
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,260
brothers out of the Experiment Station

347
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,000
at Ottawa beginning with with a cross

348
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:10,689
and actually this is one of the earliest

349
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,809
examples of making a by parental cross

350
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:18,550
of materials to develop a new line of

351
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,709
you name it in this case it was hard red

352
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:22,539
spring lee most of

353
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,360
the development work being done at

354
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:27,759
States and by companies were selections

355
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,990
out of land races or out of farmer held

356
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,189
populations of small grains or

357
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,649
introductions that mark Carleton or

358
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,570
Hansa might have made cou banca for

359
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:41,829
example was a durum wheat introduced by

360
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:43,720
by by Hansen and COO Banco was developed

361
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,460
and as a durum wheat variety in the

362
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,550
northern Great Plains out of that a

363
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,860
selection called Acme durum was released

364
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:53,169
by South Dakota State University but it

365
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,930
wasn't a reading program per se it was a

366
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:58,719
selection program this was a breeding

367
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,699
program there developed Marcus wheat

368
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,399
the parents were read Calcutta and read

369
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,769
5 red Fife was overwhelmingly popular

370
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:09,190
spring wheat in Canada in the Northern

371
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:11,769
Plains but they made this cross for an

372
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,110
improvement of that it was put into

373
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:16,990
production in the early turn of the

374
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,519
century in Canada and ultimately arrived

375
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,609
in the northern Great Plains in about

376
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:24,099
1912 but it had poor stem rust

377
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:29,039
resistance so it's still susceptible to

378
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:31,500
stem rust so let's go back to McFadden

379
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:36,159
McFadden was following the wheat harvest

380
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,079
northward in observing wheat making

381
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,690
scientific observations of wheat and

382
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,669
stem rust and other things and he

383
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,400
eventually established this theory and

384
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,350
kept in mind that people were very

385
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,000
concerned about Barberie and trying to

386
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:51,969
eradicate Barberie and that would solve

387
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,069
the problem but Edgar was of a mind that

388
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,210
actually spores were being harbored in

389
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:58,159
Texas

390
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,380
their systems the spring weather systems

391
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,870
that would come about every spring some

392
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,120
years worse than others would start

393
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:07,039
delivering through these low pressure

394
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,000
systems they would start delivering

395
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,490
spores up the Great Plains to infect the

396
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,099
crop as it developed throughout the

397
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:21,109
springtime then in the fall when the

398
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:23,209
weather systems change like now but you

399
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:25,729
get these systems that then bring down

400
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,880
those spores and redistribute them back

401
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,759
into Texas in Mexico so he felt

402
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,820
disrupting he eventually in his career

403
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,980
if we can disrupt this Puck's any a

404
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:39,109
pathway or the puck sending a highway as

405
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,789
it was called that would be another

406
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:43,159
mechanism or another approach to

407
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:47,420
controlling stem rust especially in

408
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:50,210
North America now here's Edgar McFadden

409
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,840
later in his career in his office at

410
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,910
College Station Texas and I have it here

411
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:00,709
to just kind of get into a little Side

412
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:04,310
Story so I had the honor just a couple

413
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,710
years ago of meeting a person that was

414
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,919
an undergraduate student employee of

415
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:13,000
Edgar's and he said when he went to ask

416
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:17,180
for a job of Edgar in this office

417
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,339
sitting on a chair he walked in he went

418
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,820
to go see Edgar and Edgar was on that

419
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:23,319
phone right there but he said come on in

420
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:27,649
sit down

421
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:30,409
so Edgar sitting down or Jim Fabian the

422
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,090
guy I talked to sitting down and he was

423
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,680
looking at this photograph on the wall

424
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:37,099
and I'll show you the photograph but

425
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:41,210
it's a very intriguing photograph it's a

426
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:43,000
photograph of some Bandidos and Edgar's

427
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,860
father

428
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,150
and Edgar was noticing this guy kind of

429
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:52,659
studying the photograph and here's the

430
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,420
photograph so the man on the right-hand

431
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,240
side standing is James McFadden Edgar's

432
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,700
father down in Texas and they're in the

433
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,519
Davis mountains and the man in the dark

434
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:10,000
coat on the horse is Pancho Villa and

435
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:13,269
they encountered Pancho Villa so the

436
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,940
story is from Edgar through James who

437
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:18,339
Jim fabien to me is that here Edgar is

438
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,670
think about Edgar took this picture and

439
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:24,369
he's sitting somewhere back here with a

440
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,370
guide and the reason that they were out

441
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:29,769
looking in this part of the area is the

442
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,929
guide the Mexican guy Edgar's father and

443
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:33,490
Edgar were looking for a new pasture to

444
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,210
turn their cattle into they were looking

445
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:40,359
for grazing land they they met up with

446
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:45,940
with these Bandidos and Edgar as a young

447
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:47,439
man takes a picture so click well the

448
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,549
Bandito that's back here were there

449
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,080
Edgar was where the camera is a revolver

450
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:57,129
comes out and it's pointed right at

451
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:59,889
Edgar's chest and holy hell breaks loose

452
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:04,270
they were up said if someone took a

453
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:08,250
picture of Pancho via and the guide that

454
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:12,789
was with them stepped in the way of of

455
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:15,579
the aim and calm down the situation so

456
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:18,339
no one was shot at grrrrrr McFadden was

457
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:20,669
not shot imagine imagine yourself in

458
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,669
that situation

459
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,558
now I've been held at gunpoint in other

460
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,629
countries and I can tell you get your

461
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,190
attention and you think about it and you

462
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:31,079
have a hard time getting to sleep and

463
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,659
things like that I imagine that would

464
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:41,839
have Edgar as well but the very next

465
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:44,039
photograph in that role is this one so

466
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,319
the guide that they were with the

467
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,210
interpreter did a a really great job

468
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,678
here you got these guys that are mugging

469
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,889
the camera you see the mountains in the

470
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,739
background this guy looks like the

471
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:57,959
meanest one right there look at the

472
00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:00,749
bandoleros of ammunition and all of that

473
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:05,308
but that's the encounter that he had and

474
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:07,919
I'm convinced that that was a turning

475
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:11,398
point in Edgar's life because after that

476
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,369
event and Edgar went back on the harvest

477
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:16,288
wheat harvest followed it back up to the

478
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:18,538
northern part of the United States back

479
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:20,069
in South Dakota and when he got to South

480
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,470
Dakota he wrote back and said I'm not

481
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:24,928
I'm just not coming and I think that

482
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,028
this was the pivotal moment he wanted to

483
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:28,950
do something else with his life

484
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:32,548
something else as a career he wanted to

485
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,558
make an impact and doing that down in

486
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:36,480
Texas wasn't wasn't gonna get him there

487
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,368
so he went back to the family farm they

488
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,639
still owned moved back to Webster South

489
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:44,278
Dakota and his parents followed him back

490
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:45,959
to South Dakota now the family still to

491
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:48,569
this day still owns that land owned by

492
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,058
Balmer a Texas I don't see how you can

493
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,038
run many cattle out there but but

494
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:55,819
nevertheless that's what brought him

495
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,220
back to South Dakota in 1911

496
00:22:55,819 --> 00:23:01,048
Edgar went to school bear in mind he had

497
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,690
an eighth-grade education he can't enter

498
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:05,388
into college and so many of the

499
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,820
land-grant institutions like it

500
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:11,819
Minnesota North Dakota elsewhere they

501
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:14,939
had an affiliated school called an Aggie

502
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:17,939
school it was really a boarding school

503
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,649
and it was put there as part of the

504
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,259
initial land-grant mission to provide

505
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:24,748
opportunity because communities like

506
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:26,549
Webster South Dakota didn't have high

507
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:28,710
schools

508
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:31,950
going to further their education in

509
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,980
those communities so Edgar entered into

510
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,029
the Aggie school or this official name

511
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,640
was the South Dakota School of

512
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,740
Agriculture and since it was right

513
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,130
across right across the street it was on

514
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,109
the campus of South Dakota State College

515
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,090
he got to meet a lot of the scientists

516
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:50,779
including Manley Champlin who was there

517
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:53,730
and Manley was an agronomist and and

518
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:56,220
initial breeder at South Dakota State

519
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,019
and Manley was one of those people and I

520
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,180
think all of you in this room have both

521
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,069
people that take you under their wing

522
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,039
they're your mentor and they further

523
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:08,519
your career and Manley Champlin was that

524
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:11,490
person for her for Edgar McFadden so

525
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,680
manly hired Edgar he knew that he had a

526
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,480
winner because he was he was self driven

527
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,789
he was inquisitive

528
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,579
he understood understood the science and

529
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,889
he wanted to learn more so he was busy

530
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:26,189
with a small grains research throughout

531
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,650
eastern South Dakota working not just on

532
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,019
wheat but barley and other crops and

533
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,240
actually Edgar as a young man and

534
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,129
Champlin they released I mentioned acne

535
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:42,509
as a selection out of kabocha durum

536
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:45,360
wheat they released that Edgar ever

537
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:47,460
interested in in stem rust he was

538
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,769
reading the literature he took note I've

539
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,170
seen this nope so he really took a note

540
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:55,400
that mark Carleton had observed that

541
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:58,289
durum and M are so distant relatives of

542
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,210
hexaploid wheat were resistant to stem

543
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,589
rust and leaf rust and suggested that

544
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,410
they might be used as a germ plasm

545
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:06,389
source in a breeding program after that

546
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,670
the year later john cole at south dakota

547
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,530
state reported that his observation

548
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:13,100
there was that they were resistant to

549
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:15,839
confirm they were resistant to stem rust

550
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:18,269
so Edgar completed his term at the

551
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:23,939
boarding school and entered South Dakota

552
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:25,619
State as a freshman at age 24 in 1914

553
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,930
but by that time he had already been

554
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:30,329
doing a lot of the hands-on work and a

555
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,340
lot of the self driven work and I

556
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:34,319
actually still have a lot of his papers

557
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,419
in the collection that I've archived at

558
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,599
the University one of those is his

559
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,640
English paper English ten of course

560
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,250
and the title of that paper was my aim

561
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,370
in coming to college and I think it

562
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,788
describes what drove him throughout his

563
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:52,709
life and he said having received a fair

564
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:54,419
education in the school of practical

565
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,759
experience in the University of Hard

566
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:01,080
Knocks for you talk about that episode

567
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:03,329
with poncho and hard knocks at which

568
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,918
institutions I learned it was usually

569
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,869
the man with the scientific college

570
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,830
training who comes out ahead in all

571
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:13,918
fields I have come to to the conclusion

572
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:16,619
that zeal and he had zeal but zeal

573
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,470
without knowledge will achieve great

574
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,629
things only with difficulty he was

575
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,058
looking to add to his knowledge he had

576
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,970
the zeal he wanted to achieve great

577
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:30,269
things and he wrote that later on that

578
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,029
in 1913 he decided to achieve great

579
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:35,250
things and that great thing was to have

580
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:38,849
achieved stem rust and we first

581
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:41,460
resistance in 30 1913 he said his

582
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:45,839
pathway he was doing things like

583
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,819
reaching out to the USDA of office of

584
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,379
Plant Industry asking for germ plasm

585
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,450
here's a letter I got out of the

586
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,000
National Archives asking for some beer

587
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,130
list barley so he was wasn't working on

588
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,359
just wheat but barley and corn winter

589
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,190
wheat

590
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,199
he had a publication his first

591
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,470
publication they screwed up his name

592
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,288
they have it he he was es McFadden not

593
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:10,019
EA McFadden but the paper has he a

594
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:12,658
McFadden it was on some inner specific

595
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:15,359
crosses that he was doing with rye so

596
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,120
back before we were developing triticale

597
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:24,969
he was doing these rye and triticum

598
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:27,069
crosses a lot of the conventional now

599
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,289
at the time including coming out of

600
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:32,319
places like Cornell and South Dakota

601
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:37,450
State and Harvard was that these crosses

602
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:40,059
between species were impossible and one

603
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,009
of the rationales are we know today that

604
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,079
we have these varying genomes that we

605
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:47,109
haven't then the traitor comes we have

606
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,359
Emmer which is a tetraploid you have

607
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:51,490
common wheat back then they kept

608
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,349
referring to it as triticum vulgar its

609
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:56,349
Triticum aestivum which is that

610
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:58,419
hexaploid with the three genomes but

611
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:00,369
because of these genomic differences

612
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:04,150
that it's impossible for these things to

613
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:06,519
cross and and don't waste your time but

614
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,850
Edgar took this approach of start

615
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,589
wanting to not listen to that and

616
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:13,059
develop what he could in inner specific

617
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,189
crosses and it's one of his earlier

618
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:17,379
attempts of that was in wheat rye

619
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,100
hybrids there's this paper that I

620
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:27,750
mentioned earlier on that was published

621
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:27,750
in in this genetics journal

622
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:33,429
but he had a much bigger activity and a

623
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,340
much bigger project that he had underway

624
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:39,278
and he was developing starting in 1913

625
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:42,579
his germ plasm base and he utilized his

626
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,980
farm to develop that base I mentioned

627
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:47,199
Marquess wasn't a important variety at

628
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:52,269
the time and it wasn't didn't really

629
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:56,048
come into the Dakotas until 1912 he had

630
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:57,970
it in 1913 and he was doing some pure

631
00:28:56,048 --> 00:29:00,849
lines collections out of Marquess the

632
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,669
best-possible plants and I'm saving that

633
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:05,859
seed he obtained

634
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:07,840
Yaroslav an Emer as a planter

635
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:10,538
introduction from usda so that's a

636
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:14,288
tetraploid that he obtained seed of and

637
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:18,609
grew that out on the farm and he made

638
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:22,118
selections of of c or a selection from a

639
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:23,819
single rust-free plant off of his farm

640
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:27,459
at Webster South Dakota

641
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:29,349
he was obtaining materials also from

642
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,778
other lines of Emma there was a white

643
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:34,498
spring Emmer that he was working with he

644
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:36,999
was working with his own Acme durum

645
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:38,860
bluestem wheat was another land race

646
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:41,528
which was popular in the Northern Plains

647
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:44,648
the Dakotas and indeed into Canada and

648
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:47,378
then I can never pronounce this thing

649
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:49,359
but it's a mellow Durham which was

650
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:51,788
another introduction that the

651
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:57,398
Minnesotans used a stem rust uses source

652
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:59,200
for Thatcher and other releases so Edgar

653
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:06,579
went about to make the impossible cross

654
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:08,440
in 1916 and he did this he had he had

655
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:11,769
lived in a boarding house about two

656
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,519
blocks off of campus and so he did this

657
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:18,669
work in the backyard of his boarding

658
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,220
house and he would write that on July

659
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:22,659
4th he was busy making these crosses

660
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,548
while the rest of the city was out

661
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:27,159
celebrating the nation's independence

662
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:29,829
but he spent the 4th of July and

663
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,769
undoubtedly many other days paying

664
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:36,519
attention to to an thesis but making

665
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:38,919
crosses as he had learned to do in his

666
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,640
preparation with other crops and other

667
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,490
attempts before that so

668
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,980
was putting his two or three years of

669
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,769
crossing experience to work in this

670
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:51,740
project so here's the crossing block

671
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:53,629
that he had in the backyard he cost what

672
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,170
I think this is amazing the female

673
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:59,270
parent was the tetraploid Yaroslav Emmer

674
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,980
and he had Marcus those selections out

675
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,869
of Marcus as the male parent then he

676
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,630
also crossed Marcus with another

677
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:07,789
tetraploid acme durham white spring

678
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,590
Emmer was crossed with Marquess and the

679
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:11,178
other durham entry was crossed with

680
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:14,990
marcus as well so he made all these

681
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:15,919
hundreds and hundreds of crosses in the

682
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,419
backyard

683
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:24,230
I have Edgar's field notes that are in

684
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:25,630
the archive at SDSU that go from 1915 to

685
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:30,950
[Music]

686
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:34,790
1955 and when I found this page I was

687
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:37,819
flipping through it at home in front of

688
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:39,710
the TV and I just started crying because

689
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:41,928
I found something very important my wife

690
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:46,750
was kind of looking at me but let's zoom

691
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:50,330
into the top half of that so these are

692
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:54,230
just a record of what the entries were

693
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:57,349
in 1917 so let's go back I'm going to go

694
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,660
back a couple slides 1916 he made these

695
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:02,569
crosses and obviously he collected

696
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:06,590
progeny collected what seed he could off

697
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:08,869
of these crosses 1916 s done right so he

698
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:12,109
had a bunch of seed and he planted that

699
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:15,529
in a nursery at SDSU on the agronomy

700
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:19,219
farm in Brookings and it was planted on

701
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:21,319
March 31st in Brookings and so these are

702
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,200
the various entries that he had he had

703
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,970
some air Slav Emmer's as controls and

704
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,929
things like that but what I have a

705
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:34,669
highlight on here is that we have this

706
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:37,490
Yaroslav Emmer by marquess f1 cross and

707
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:40,720
then later on in pencil he said these

708
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:46,118
are the parents of hope wheat this

709
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:49,419
the only plant one plant out of all that

710
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:51,939
that had viable progeny yet one viable

711
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:54,190
seed that came out of all that work all

712
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,399
those other crosses that I mentioned in

713
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:00,308
1916 nothing came of that in terms of

714
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:04,508
viable seed he had one plant that came

715
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:08,440
out of this inner specific cross okay so

716
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:10,659
out of that he planted that and in 1917

717
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,599
off of this plant he harvested about a

718
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:17,109
hundred seeds that were the beginning of

719
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:18,638
his work actually his life's work but

720
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:21,158
there are some other challenges that

721
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:25,719
came in the way 1918 what was going on

722
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:28,749
in 1918 World War one Edgar was a

723
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,909
patriot a lot of his family who fought

724
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:33,759
in the Revolutionary War he was proud of

725
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:38,440
his heritage and his family and he was

726
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:40,149
proud to serve the country so South

727
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,190
Dakota State many other colleges

728
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:44,168
hastened the graduating class they

729
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,479
graduated in April out in May or June

730
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:48,909
and they graduated it in April so that

731
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:51,249
they could get these folks out and to

732
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:53,080
their postings as World War One was

733
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:57,519
going on so he graduated from South

734
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:59,589
Dakota State 1918 April 19th and then he

735
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,019
lets his diary there on the left-hand

736
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:05,168
side May 4th he said well I've gone and

737
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:08,769
done it I got married to Mabel the

738
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:10,599
sealed bleak sleeve better or worse well

739
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:12,878
if I if I wrote well I have written

740
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,879
things like that and I've gotten but we

741
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,618
won't go there so they did a honeymoon

742
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,538
out in the Black Hills and then by the

743
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:21,399
before the month was done he reported

744
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:25,659
for duty and was shipped off was

745
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:28,480
Washington but I have we always made the

746
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,639
assumptions that that you see here that

747
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,338
he went on a harvest furlough and it was

748
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,588
common for those folks that were still

749
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:37,989
posted domestically they could go home

750
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:40,108
and help harvest the crop because the

751
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,809
crop was important to the war effort

752
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:44,630
and so we always

753
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,250
this assumption that Edgar said I need

754
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,550
to go harvest the crop he just didn't

755
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,750
tell him that it was a hundred plants

756
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:53,180
but I have the letters that show

757
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,159
otherwise as soon as he was leaving in

758
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:57,799
May he was in communication with USDA

759
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,929
and the army say look I got this

760
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,780
important work going on at Highmore

761
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:05,029
South Dakota and will I get a furlough

762
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,200
to go collect these important samples

763
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,630
and they let him do it

764
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,179
USDA supported it and so it was upfront

765
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,430
it wasn't any kind of shenanigans he he

766
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:18,980
got a harvest furlough to do science and

767
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:20,539
I talked about having some forethought I

768
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,429
am very impressed with that

769
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:28,849
so 1918 rolls along and then November

770
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:32,179
11th we have Armistice Day let's see if

771
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:36,440
he can pick out the 5 foot 4 inch Edgar

772
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:39,589
McFadden out of this slide it's it's

773
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,740
obvious that no Edgar is the guy third

774
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:45,500
from the left and the front hand roll

775
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:48,139
and he looks like someone that's

776
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:51,860
encountered porch Pancho Villa only this

777
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:53,569
time he's not going to run away he he's

778
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:57,590
really looking at that camera and I get

779
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:59,390
a big kick out of that so while I head

780
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:03,590
ger was at Camp Lewis in Washington

781
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:05,269
State on November 7th yeah and I won't

782
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,550
read this letter but this is one of my

783
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:09,800
favorite artifacts that we have he had

784
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,990
this newspaper and he turned it sideways

785
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,360
and put it into the typewriter and wrote

786
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:18,619
this letter to his bride back in South

787
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:20,570
Dakota just asking is war over or is it

788
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:22,519
not he's been hearing news reports that

789
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,680
there a discussion of treaty and

790
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,059
armistice going on in Europe and they're

791
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,759
wanting to know whether they're gonna

792
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:31,279
ship off soon or they're gonna get to go

793
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,980
home he's also asking about what else

794
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,160
was going on in 1980 18 well it was the

795
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,110
horrendous flu epidemic that was going

796
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,839
on so he's asking about his father and

797
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:45,530
other family members and the health of

798
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:50,120
his mother etc but I love that he

799
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:55,600
finishes that up as your husband private

800
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,599
yes McFadden dear wife

801
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:08,210
dear wife your your husband yeah the war

802
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:11,420
ended and in I didn't mention earlier

803
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,789
that when he finished up at graduated

804
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,860
from SDSU his first job was working at

805
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:18,019
Highmore South Dakota I spent a lot of

806
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,490
my career I'm or South Dakota if you

807
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:24,320
blink while you're driving through it

808
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:26,599
you probably miss it it's we used to

809
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,950
send things there too really a stressful

810
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,500
environment there's about a hundred

811
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:33,949
about 80 miles to know about a hundred

812
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,170
miles west of Brookings so he lived it

813
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:38,119
high more well a year later after going

814
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,430
to Camp Lewis he was right back at high

815
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,730
more to carry forward the cereal

816
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:47,599
breeding program especially his hybrids

817
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,219
between Emmer and marco sweet but with

818
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,289
lack of federal funding this sounds

819
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:57,109
familiar doesn't it he was instructed to

820
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:58,789
terminate the program by 1920 USDA I

821
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,800
have the letters from the National

822
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:02,480
Archive they tried to recruit Edgar to

823
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,480
be in charge of the wheat program and

824
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,039
move him to Washington DC and he just

825
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,980
didn't want to do that he didn't want to

826
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,940
be a desk jockey he wrote and so he

827
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:15,800
decided to go back to the farm and

828
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,960
Webster to farm and be a seedsman and he

829
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,660
got licensed from South Dakota State to

830
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,970
take all this material with him and

831
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:26,929
further along the development of this

832
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:28,819
material on his own farm you folks could

833
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:32,029
go better go could go through this

834
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:34,700
better than me well we'll try to make a

835
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:36,680
some salient points on this but these

836
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:39,889
are this is the generational advance of

837
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:42,929
the cross that he made between Yaroslav

838
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:46,078
Emmer and Marquess

839
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:49,139
this was the key points are he advanced

840
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,480
lines he did a lot of bulk poppin

841
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,730
bulking and and population selections

842
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,829
for for plumpness of grain and things

843
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,990
like that he did this in various

844
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:59,970
environments brookings that started then

845
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:03,449
it moved to high more for a couple years

846
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:05,909
severe rust occurred in 1919 so a lot of

847
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:08,250
nice selection pressure there and in

848
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:11,519
nineteen twenty then he went to the farm

849
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,639
his own farm in 1921 to continue to

850
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,338
advance it one of the years he got

851
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:19,618
severe hail occurred so he looked for

852
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:22,170
those phenotypes that were resistant to

853
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:27,088
that hail good stock strength came out

854
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:29,369
of that 1924 by that time he had 63

855
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:32,159
selections that were grown in in single

856
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:34,318
rows or head rows by that time he was

857
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,808
imagine he was evaluating yield

858
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:41,038
it says stem rust leaf rust protein

859
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:42,778
gluten he didn't have a Farina graph or

860
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:46,550
mix a graph or anything like that how

861
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:50,719
did they how did he determine gluten

862
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:53,380
hmmm know what he did was pop about half

863
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,969
a dozen kernels in his mouth and chew it

864
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,039
that's what breeders were doing then so

865
00:39:55,969 --> 00:40:00,919
you chew it to develop gluten and so it

866
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:03,050
was a subjective scale that people were

867
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,360
doing I I still remember doing that when

868
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,860
I was an undergraduate do that you

869
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,019
weren't collecting data but you're just

870
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,510
kind of doing a field assessment and

871
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:13,309
farmers do that today folks so they'll

872
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,660
take a few grains pop them in the mouth

873
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:16,730
start chewing it crunch crunch crunch

874
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:18,799
but you're trying to determine what kind

875
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:22,579
of gluten formation that you're going to

876
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,789
get out of there out of that wheat he

877
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:29,029
selected three lines ultimately they

878
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:32,509
were called H 44 H 49 each thirty-five

879
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:36,290
nothing really became of age 35 but H 44

880
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:41,240
and H 49 where Mon you mental to the

881
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:44,659
wheat industry around the globe in 1925

882
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:47,689
he decided to grow out H 49 that's what

883
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:52,460
he was most interested in and put it to

884
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:55,730
the test he obtained the most virulent

885
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,349
lines the nine most virulent strains of

886
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,349
stem rust and he got him from Elvin

887
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,940
statement just across the border and

888
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:04,190
then he also did some seedling stage

889
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,260
evaluations also with some stem rust

890
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:09,470
that that came from Elvin statement and

891
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,390
he surrounded that nursery with Marcus

892
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:13,069
wheat and he got a hundred percent

893
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:14,659
failure of the Marcus weed

894
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,010
one hundred percent failure of the

895
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:22,599
Marcus weed from these infections but

896
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:26,770
age 49 was absent of stem rust

897
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,769
completely absent after all of that

898
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:31,779
he knew he had something important so he

899
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:36,019
released a variety and he named it hope

900
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:39,060
he named it hope because it was the hope

901
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:42,539
of the industry and so

902
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:45,179
the registration certificate for hope

903
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,300
wheat shows Edgar as the breeder based

904
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:52,679
in Webster South Dakota

905
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:54,960
he also made available at no cost this

906
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,039
germ plasm to public breeders throughout

907
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,220
the Great Plains

908
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,920
so as me as a vice president in charge

909
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:05,039
of intellectual property giving away

910
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,289
things for free was i it wasn't allowed

911
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:11,369
really by Board of Regents policy but

912
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:13,529
just think of how important that was to

913
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:16,259
developing stem rust resistant weeds

914
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:18,960
throughout the Great Plains just

915
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,210
critically important so he sent this out

916
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,130
to his colleagues and in several

917
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:25,500
different states and in Saskatchewan and

918
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:28,500
by that by the way by this time Manley

919
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:32,119
Champlin his mentor was it University of

920
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,119
Saskatchewan as a weak leader

921
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,940
that led to several different

922
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,620
derivatives new varieties you can look

923
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,030
this up probably do it on your phone

924
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,319
while you're sitting there listening but

925
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,570
he published this work in the

926
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,130
predecessor of agronomy journal the

927
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,830
Journal of the American Society of

928
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,200
agronomy there's the reference he

929
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:53,789
published this in 1930 and it's just a

930
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,399
description of everything that I just

931
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:58,469
got done talking to you about his

932
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,420
description of how he developed hope

933
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:03,269
wheat and what his experiences were in

934
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,190
this credit this preceding thought that

935
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:07,440
such a thing was impossible and he

936
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,809
wrapped it up with this to talk to that

937
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,349
audience and he said here is good

938
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:15,059
evidence that it is possible to breed

939
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:17,789
into our common wheats desirable

940
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,579
characteristics that are found presently

941
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:24,539
only in different groups such as Emmer

942
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:26,869
durum einkorn ryi jalops and other

943
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:28,820
related grasses

944
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:31,400
very important I think that's a very

945
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,940
important paper so but he was age 34 at

946
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,670
that time and he had made a tremendous

947
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:41,510
success that made a big splash in the

948
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:43,460
wheat arena and then USDA wanted him

949
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,380
back so they hired him back and started

950
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,139
a new experiment station in Redfield

951
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,480
South North High more and that's where

952
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:53,150
he raised his family was in high

953
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,690
redfield South Dakota but he talks about

954
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:58,960
this period of time from 1929 to 1935 as

955
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:01,490
the worst part of his career

956
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,530
instead of leading his program and

957
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:05,899
developing something like hope now he

958
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,990
was serving a whole bureaucracy in USDA

959
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,599
serving other plant breeders answering

960
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:13,939
to people at the main office in

961
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,650
Minneapolis actually st. Paul and so he

962
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,490
didn't really enjoy that didn't like

963
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,309
that at all

964
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:21,019
but he still had this theory that he

965
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:24,559
developed that I talked about earlier

966
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:26,539
and that is we have spores that are

967
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,460
blowing up from the southern part of the

968
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,650
country into the north and then being

969
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,460
redistributed how is it that we're going

970
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,460
to combat that

971
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:38,969
coming here to talk at Cornell I have to

972
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,470
have present I love this photograph I'd

973
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:45,209
like to know where this building is

974
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:48,088
anybody can I'm not sure where it is but

975
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:50,579
this is the International 6th Congress

976
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:54,630
of genetics in April 1932 here at

977
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:57,480
Cornell so we have some great people

978
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:02,220
that attended there's Edgar McFadden up

979
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:07,190
front Barbara McClintock is right there

980
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:08,848
also a participant Nikolai Vavilov

981
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,030
Nikolai Vavilov

982
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:15,150
was at this event who knows that name

983
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:18,450
just a monumental a lot of times I asked

984
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:21,660
that at other times who was he

985
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:26,189
one one of the most important figures

986
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:29,338
out of our area of work and he hailed

987
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:32,010
out of Russia Nikolai Vavilov

988
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:33,779
and then I had Paul pocono in here he

989
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,900
really wasn't an agronomist or crop

990
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:39,480
geneticist his brother Wilson pocono was

991
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,880
a one of those plant explorers that I

992
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,409
mentioned earlier and his son Hugh

993
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,940
Pocono who I got to know as a soil

994
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:48,058
scientist at the University of Florida

995
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,880
Paul Pope and all was into human

996
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:54,240
eugenics and so he had an interesting

997
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,760
and and a disruptive career during his

998
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,709
life times a lot of interesting folks

999
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,140
there ICI statement and signed up as a

1000
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,690
as a participant but he's not in the in

1001
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,298
the photograph and I just just tragic

1002
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:08,789
this is Nikolai Vavilov this is his mug

1003
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:10,889
shot when he was arrested I just grabbed

1004
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:13,588
this yesterday in my hotel room I wanted

1005
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:17,308
to include it you can see how he was

1006
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:20,818
kind of physically abused at his arrest

1007
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:25,290
in 1940 by the Stalin regime and he died

1008
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:27,989
in 1943 in a gulag and in in Russia just

1009
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:30,469
tragic a tragic end to a great person in

1010
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:30,469
the great mine

1011
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:36,789
so Edgar was complaining to USDA and he

1012
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:38,739
wanted to change his career he said I

1013
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:40,719
want to do something about stem rust

1014
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:42,969
more so than what I've been doing and he

1015
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:46,480
said if we could develop stem rust

1016
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:50,139
resistance in winter wheat and early

1017
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,349
spring wheats in Texas what we will do

1018
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:56,588
is disrupt the pot the spore base and

1019
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:58,330
lower the spore count so that less

1020
00:46:56,588 --> 00:47:02,920
spores are blown up in the northern

1021
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:05,619
Great Plains send me to Texas so they

1022
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,079
did that they sent edgar McFadden moved

1023
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:09,430
him from his loved South Dakota and he

1024
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,130
moved back down to Texas and they

1025
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:17,710
stationed in the College Station Texas

1026
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:20,200
as a USDA assistant agronomist by that

1027
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:23,108
time Paul Mangelsdorf had already

1028
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:25,569
obtained hope and h44

1029
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:28,150
and had bred that into his winter wheat

1030
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:32,380
lines that he was developing in Texas

1031
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:34,750
and as Edgar was arriving in Texas Paul

1032
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:37,300
Mangelsdorf left to start his brilliant

1033
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:40,088
career and in corn genetics at Harvard

1034
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,490
so he left Texas A&amp;M to go on to Harvard

1035
00:47:40,088 --> 00:47:47,409
and he left behind all this wonderful

1036
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:49,659
germ plasm had hope in it left that back

1037
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:52,480
behind for for Edgar to take advantage

1038
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:55,118
of and Edgar did so what what did Edgar

1039
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,869
do or what was going on I want to touch

1040
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,200
about that

1041
00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:01,930
so remember the barbary eradication

1042
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,579
program that the usda the US government

1043
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:07,868
put millions of dollars into to

1044
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:11,019
eradicate Barberie and try to lower or

1045
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:14,588
base and every black dot on this map is

1046
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:16,719
a farm where Barberie was eradicated and

1047
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:19,210
you think about the a hundred years ago

1048
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:22,239
we didn't have glyphosate we didn't have

1049
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:26,108
2 4 d didn't have herbicides to do that

1050
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:30,879
so we did it with rock salt and with

1051
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:33,579
kerosene you identify a Barberie bush or

1052
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,430
a plant and you just kill it

1053
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:38,108
with with these with these materials

1054
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:40,559
that just take it out it wouldn't

1055
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:42,098
suffice to dig it out he had to use

1056
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,228
these measures

1057
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:47,400
of rock salt or kerosene to saturated

1058
00:48:44,228 --> 00:48:51,118
soil kerosene that's a great idea

1059
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,940
nevertheless where was the success

1060
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,890
here's 1935 look what look at the

1061
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,380
percentage loss of the crop that we had

1062
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:01,358
to stem rust in Minnesota North Dakota

1063
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,130
South Dakota one hundred and five

1064
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:07,748
million bushels of loss to stem rust

1065
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:11,170
very little success and very little

1066
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:12,939
belief that Barberie control alone was

1067
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,900
going to be important to the control of

1068
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:18,818
stem rust and we had some periodic other

1069
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:22,059
infestations later on their percent stem

1070
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:23,920
rust loss of 30 percent in South Dakota

1071
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:27,249
and 60 percent in North Dakota just

1072
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,430
think of the economic impact that had it

1073
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:34,959
was enormous it was huge

1074
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:37,449
so Edgar started working in 1935 and he

1075
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,970
started evaluating foreign introductions

1076
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:42,608
he had just had this massive evaluation

1077
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:44,259
program going on of everything he could

1078
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:47,798
get his hands on from the USDA

1079
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:49,960
collection he got accessions from babel

1080
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:53,079
off its colleague of in russia and

1081
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,969
elsewhere materials out of south america

1082
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,548
and he started evaluating these things

1083
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:59,920
in College Station or susceptibility to

1084
00:49:57,548 --> 00:50:01,568
stem rust and for yield obviously and

1085
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,909
some of the materials he was developing

1086
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:06,940
came out a Mangelsdorf breeding program

1087
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:10,858
hoped by Mediterranean crosses and he

1088
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,858
was still continuing to work with stake

1089
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:18,980
he had this is just a summary of what I

1090
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:22,039
just got done saying he was making some

1091
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,869
releases 1938 he released Austin Austin

1092
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:25,970
where it was really a cross that was

1093
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:29,119
done by mangles Mangelsdorf and then

1094
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:32,239
Edgar made the selections and that was a

1095
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,430
hope derive Seabreeze was a soft red

1096
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,838
spring wheat that he also developed out

1097
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:38,808
of the out of that material

1098
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,739
he developed a wonderful collaboration

1099
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,599
with her Nasir's

1100
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:45,139
is that a name that that people

1101
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,690
recognize Edgar McFadden and Ernest

1102
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:49,699
Sears started to do their own intensive

1103
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:54,920
work of interspecific crosses and

1104
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:56,230
develop aneuploid and they published

1105
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,869
together

1106
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:02,599
Edgar McFadden and Ernest Sears 1946 the

1107
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:04,970
origin of triticum spelt ax and it's

1108
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:08,210
free thrashing hexaploid relatives the

1109
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:11,959
same title two citations in the Journal

1110
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:15,639
of heredity volume 37 page 81 and also

1111
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,559
volume 37 107 solo kind of a version of

1112
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:20,719
Part one and Part two interesting read

1113
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:24,230
some of our earliest understandings of

1114
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:25,818
how we evolved over the years a lot has

1115
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,750
changed since that paper but it's an

1116
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:32,150
interesting paper and he wrote in there

1117
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:36,048
he said McFadden wrote that he

1118
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:38,180
postulated in 1913 that vulgar wheats

1119
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:40,400
were fixed hybrids between Emmer's and

1120
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:42,618
another weld relative and he said he

1121
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,548
started preliminary experiments in the

1122
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:48,349
summer of 1913 so we're gonna jump into

1123
00:51:46,548 --> 00:51:51,380
a different phase in the talk and that

1124
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:52,880
is let's look at Mexico so Edgar's

1125
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,210
trying to develop these stem rust

1126
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,180
resistant lines in Texas Vice President

1127
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:01,940
Henry Wallace made a a trip before the

1128
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:03,949
presidential elections in 1940 down to

1129
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,250
Mexico we were worried about Mexico

1130
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:10,129
joining the Axis powers prior to our

1131
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:12,170
involvement in World War two and he came

1132
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:16,160
back and said you know what what we can

1133
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:18,680
do to prevent Mexico or or mitigate the

1134
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,528
risk of medical Mexico be joining the

1135
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:24,119
Axis powers is to help them with poverty

1136
00:52:21,528 --> 00:52:26,010
and to help them with food security

1137
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,039
and bring some of our agricultural

1138
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:31,050
research expertise to Mexico and he also

1139
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:35,159
wrote that if we do that let's focus on

1140
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:36,890
beans corn and wheat and if it's wheat

1141
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:40,170
we're gonna focus on stem rust

1142
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:43,710
resistance and nitrogen fertility to get

1143
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:45,780
the protein level up so there was a

1144
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:48,090
delegation funded by the Rockefeller

1145
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,760
Foundation a statement was part of it

1146
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:54,120
mangles Dorf Bradfield I believe was on

1147
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:58,770
this as well dr. Brad field out of

1148
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:02,269
Cornell Irene Bradfield Halden our Baron

1149
00:52:58,769 --> 00:53:02,269
Emerson we're next door to Brad field

1150
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:10,429
comes from they did a massive tour of

1151
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:13,400
the entire country to discern what the

1152
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:18,799
problems are of common people in Mexico

1153
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:21,200
and including establishment of of some

1154
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,200
of their operations in Japan go just on

1155
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:26,179
it right outside of Mexico City with

1156
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:28,259
those recommendations of focusing first

1157
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:31,799
on stem rust

1158
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:34,619
where are they gonna go where are they

1159
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,810
going to get their materials well

1160
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:38,130
they're gonna go to edgar McFadden who

1161
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:42,480
happens to be living in College Station

1162
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:45,690
Texas and Edgar wrote back to this to

1163
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,789
this Rockefeller group and he had three

1164
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:50,280
recommendations I'll only provide two of

1165
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:52,619
those and he said let's do chip n go

1166
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,109
experiment 1 that's what his handwritten

1167
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:58,559
note said chip Ingo experiment 1 and

1168
00:53:55,108 --> 00:54:02,159
these are bulks from Edgar McFadden he

1169
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:05,070
provided 60 bulks including 15 crosses

1170
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,199
of some a Mangelsdorf material and some

1171
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,609
of the other materials with with some

1172
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,689
other introductions that came out of

1173
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:12,119
South America

1174
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:16,289
and he also provided his new variety

1175
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:19,680
Austin and then experiment 2 where wheat

1176
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:21,809
selections 44 misil xions that he just

1177
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:24,059
provided and said start evaluating these

1178
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:27,599
he laid out all the experimental designs

1179
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:29,820
and how to analyze the data he just laid

1180
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,858
it all out for them black and white and

1181
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:36,390
sent it and shared it and that's what

1182
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:38,880
they did in Mexico it was being led by

1183
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:40,650
Dutch Farrar George Farrar who later

1184
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,440
became president of the Rockefeller

1185
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,630
Foundation but Dutch hereare took that

1186
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:50,400
advice and implemented it and by the way

1187
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:52,619
he was also doing some collections of

1188
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,639
accessions within Mexico itself to see

1189
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:55,680
if there might be something that

1190
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:58,858
underneath that selection pressure there

1191
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:03,919
might be something of value and so he

1192
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:06,429
started this program in Mexico in 1943

1193
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,889
ultimately

1194
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:11,289
forward by December 1944 they had the

1195
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:13,389
100 best phenotypes in the field and

1196
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:17,608
then they they drew those selections

1197
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:20,980
down to the 20 best now this individual

1198
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:25,358
dr. Borlaug he wasn't on the scene until

1199
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:28,179
December of 1944 okay so all that work

1200
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:31,058
had been done by the time Norman Borlaug

1201
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:34,539
arrived in Japan go Mexico he had a

1202
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:36,760
wooden table the packets of seed much of

1203
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:39,460
this were hope derivatives that were

1204
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,059
provided in the program was it

1205
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:44,349
visualized and drafted by Edgar McFadden

1206
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:46,390
but they were calling say they

1207
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:48,130
communicated with one another but that's

1208
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:52,868
the start that's the great head start

1209
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:55,030
that Norman Borlaug God ultimately the

1210
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:57,608
Rockefeller Foundation identified five

1211
00:55:55,030 --> 00:56:00,430
lines of promise that they increased to

1212
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:03,460
seed seed increase they got you know

1213
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:05,710
three three tons of our Rockefeller

1214
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:09,369
Foundation number to 11 a ton of this

1215
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:12,010
four tons of 209 etc three of these were

1216
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:15,220
hope derivatives from McFadden's

1217
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,470
selections in Texas so the crosses

1218
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:23,439
weren't made in Mexico they were made by

1219
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:25,419
McFadden at Texas McFadden was hired as

1220
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,380
a consultant by the Rockefeller

1221
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:31,298
Foundation and made a site visit in 2008

1222
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,250
he looked at the information they did

1223
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:38,349
site visits

1224
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:41,639
long story short Rockefeller 2012 so

1225
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:45,068
there's 2012 that's a tree go supreme by

1226
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:46,690
116 cross that was eliminated and

1227
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:50,789
discarded but everything else was

1228
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,950
advanced or a variety release including

1229
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:53,989
the

1230
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:56,868
that has a hope background was released

1231
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:59,259
as supremo anotherís Frontera and these

1232
00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:01,820
were released as varieties by the Texas

1233
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:04,220
Agricultural Experiment Station it's in

1234
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:07,220
crop science as the variety release and

1235
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:10,338
Edgar McFadden in that information was

1236
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:12,469
was named us as the breeder of the

1237
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:14,960
material the target audience were

1238
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:17,689
farmers not only in Texas but in Mexico

1239
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,909
and the idea was to have a stem rust

1240
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:22,909
resistant wine dominating the landscape

1241
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:26,449
to disrupt stem rust for development and

1242
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:29,799
thereby protecting the rest of the core

1243
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:29,799
of the United States

1244
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:33,559
this is one of those things that you get

1245
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:36,019
from the family and when you open up the

1246
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,880
file say wow where did this come from

1247
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:40,509
this is a photograph in the Houston

1248
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,300
Chronicle of Edgar and norman borlaug

1249
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:47,150
talking with a farmer in Texas about

1250
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,829
supremo and the farmer was very happy

1251
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,680
and impressed with the yield he was

1252
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:55,579
getting out of that kind of a testament

1253
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:58,549
testimony 1951 so late in the utility of

1254
00:57:55,579 --> 00:58:01,160
supremo and I say late in the utility

1255
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:02,480
because a letter came out in 1950 out of

1256
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:04,699
the rust lab at the University of

1257
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,500
Minnesota out of statement slab that

1258
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:13,069
trouble was brewing a new race race 15 B

1259
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:15,139
was making its presence in the northern

1260
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:18,588
Great Plains it's the most virulent race

1261
00:58:15,139 --> 00:58:20,659
ever isolated in North America and it

1262
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:23,358
was starting to take out varieties that

1263
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:24,500
were previously deemed to be resistant

1264
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,108
to stem rust

1265
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,880
long story short eventually it made its

1266
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:31,369
way and got established in the southern

1267
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,380
United States as well including Texas

1268
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:38,539
and including Mexico and it essentially

1269
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:41,210
took out supremo so the the breeding

1270
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:43,369
program under Norman Borlaug they had to

1271
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:46,068
develop varieties that were a

1272
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:48,440
combination of Hope background and

1273
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:51,259
Kenyan backgrounds to be able to

1274
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:55,568
withstand stem rust and seedling stages

1275
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,569
as well as adult stages

1276
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:01,869
George Farrar wrote this about McFadden

1277
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,949
in 51 and he called him dr. McFadden he

1278
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:08,410
never had a PhD but he had a by that

1279
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:11,108
time an honorary Doctorate from South

1280
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:14,679
Dakota State University so he was

1281
00:59:11,108 --> 00:59:17,469
calling him dr. McFadden of College

1282
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:21,009
Station provided bulk wheat in the early

1283
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:22,690
days of the program in Mexico and I'll

1284
00:59:21,009 --> 00:59:24,969
just kind of go down to the bottom line

1285
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:26,798
he says we're not for the fact that

1286
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:30,429
these varieties must now be withdrawn

1287
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:32,498
because of 15b there's no doubt the

1288
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:36,909
supremo would be the single most

1289
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:39,009
important in Mexico so he was thanking

1290
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:41,949
McFadden so what was this what was this

1291
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:45,159
about hope we what was going on well the

1292
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:47,558
person that that unti 'zed all of that

1293
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:50,009
the person that took the baton from that

1294
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:56,309
work and really did the genetics work

1295
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:59,019
was Bob McIntosh at the University of

1296
00:59:56,309 --> 01:00:01,239
Sydney out in Australia and I've gotten

1297
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:02,948
to know Bob through this through this

1298
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:04,900
work that I've been doing about McFadden

1299
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:06,999
and he's gotten to know McFadden and we

1300
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,309
had Bob and Brookings just last May as

1301
01:00:06,998 --> 01:00:12,939
part of the Fadden symposium so I stolen

1302
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:17,410
some of his slides and Bob so what Bob

1303
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:19,298
said about hope in age 44 is that yes

1304
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:21,399
indeed at the time of release hope in

1305
01:00:19,298 --> 01:00:22,838
age 44 were highly resistant to stem

1306
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,108
rust and it goes back to a couple

1307
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:28,719
important genes one of those used to be

1308
01:00:26,108 --> 01:00:31,598
sr one it's recognized as that's our

1309
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:34,469
ninety was one and that's primarily the

1310
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:38,469
source of resistance for seedling stages

1311
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:42,278
of resistance in in these varieties and

1312
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:44,940
there's this sr2 in sr2 is still

1313
01:00:42,278 --> 01:00:52,119
recognized as the most important

1314
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:55,539
resistance gene to adult stages of stem

1315
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,608
rust stem rust expression in in adult

1316
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:00,759
plant stages it's still we're still

1317
01:00:57,608 --> 01:01:04,088
counting on sr2 in varieties and places

1318
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:06,409
against ug99 and you know other other

1319
01:01:04,088 --> 01:01:11,900
problems that are out there

1320
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:13,159
so it's about sr2 and sr9 I'm running

1321
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,150
out of time so I'm going to go through

1322
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:16,149
these a little bit quicker

1323
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:23,759
so that's the bottom line that we have

1324
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:28,429
right there sr2 has some pleiotropic

1325
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:31,650
effects we are we always see some black

1326
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:35,009
pseudo black chaff or brown necrosis in

1327
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:37,680
varieties that that are expressing sr to

1328
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:39,810
one is linked to the other

1329
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:42,868
that's an anti it's not a very

1330
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:46,049
attractive trait to have expressed in

1331
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:48,000
wheat the wheat industry familiars don't

1332
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,730
especially like it it doesn't really

1333
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,909
impact yield or impact the quality or

1334
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:55,889
performance per se but it is is a anti

1335
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:59,368
quality trait that people don't like but

1336
01:01:55,889 --> 01:02:02,789
if you see black shaft you have sr too

1337
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:04,829
so it's a nice marker to be used for if

1338
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:08,159
sr2 is what you're looking for and you

1339
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:11,130
can see some of it sometimes sr to or

1340
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:13,139
the black chaff causes a miss diagnosis

1341
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:16,309
with other diseases like bacterial wilt

1342
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:20,639
so it causes people to unnecessarily

1343
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:24,659
treat fungicides on those types of

1344
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:28,429
varieties okay I'll head into the finish

1345
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:32,159
line here just talk about recognition

1346
01:02:28,429 --> 01:02:34,710
1945 so as the World War was ending this

1347
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:36,929
article comes out written by a w

1348
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:40,050
Erickson actually I didn't know this was

1349
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:42,269
in existence until Cindi sent it to me

1350
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:44,250
but this is a little write-up that sold

1351
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:46,469
for 25 cents that corrects all stores

1352
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:49,199
and things like that and it was about

1353
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:50,669
McFadden and how he developed hope and

1354
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,129
it's essentially the same thing that was

1355
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:55,470
published in 1930 but it had some other

1356
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:57,980
had some other information in that and

1357
01:02:55,469 --> 01:03:01,849
in this article this little booklet

1358
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:04,460
Erickson attributed winning World War 2

1359
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:07,039
to hope wheat

1360
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:09,050
because a war is fought with guns and

1361
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,809
butter right so we have to feed our

1362
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:14,990
troops we have to feed the people that

1363
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:17,449
we are occupying and liberating so

1364
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:19,129
because of our development in wheat and

1365
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:22,838
the success that it had on the wheat

1366
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:25,309
industry we could occupy and save Europe

1367
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:29,150
post-war Europe and we could save

1368
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:31,009
post-war Japan because of the abundance

1369
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:33,050
of wheat that we had during that period

1370
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:36,740
of time and we would not have had that

1371
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:38,390
if not for hope and so he was

1372
01:03:36,739 --> 01:03:42,588
attributing to that and by a way I'm

1373
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:44,329
drank that kool-aid myself obviously me

1374
01:03:42,588 --> 01:03:46,699
that led to other honors and

1375
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:49,519
recognitions Reader's Digest had a big

1376
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:51,529
write-up on him and Texas he was a

1377
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:54,170
scroll of honor and the chem merging

1378
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:57,920
society I'll talk a little bit about

1379
01:03:54,170 --> 01:04:00,470
October 10th 1947 McFadden appreciation

1380
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,409
day back in South Dakota the governor

1381
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:06,409
was there and you can see he's a fellow

1382
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:08,179
the American Society of agronomy another

1383
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:11,980
so a whole host of honors and

1384
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:14,989
recognitions the state of South Dakota

1385
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:17,659
because of his work in Texas recognized

1386
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:19,489
him for disrupting the spore base and

1387
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:21,108
saving wheat industry up and down the

1388
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:23,829
Great Plains the state of South Dakota

1389
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:28,909
brought him back and they built this

1390
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:31,309
granite monument to Edgar McFadden in

1391
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:33,829
his home town of Webster South Dakota

1392
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:35,838
there was a big deal that Governor was

1393
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:39,139
there to speak I have all the speeches

1394
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:41,809
and and such and that's Edgar there

1395
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:43,759
receiving his recognition and that's

1396
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:46,779
that's how it looks today well not today

1397
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,640
it's under three feet of snow today but

1398
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,800
but that's how it looks today

1399
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:54,710
it's still there in Webster South Dakota

1400
01:04:51,800 --> 01:05:00,339
and when I'm driving down highway 12 I

1401
01:04:54,710 --> 01:05:02,059
always make a stop that's some some

1402
01:05:00,338 --> 01:05:05,630
illustrations and The Reader's Digest

1403
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:08,088
article USDA recognized him with the

1404
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:11,780
Distinguished Service Award they stowed

1405
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:15,259
on him in National Mall there's a

1406
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,609
theater there by Washington Monument

1407
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:18,360
right there on the mall and that that's

1408
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:20,250
where Edgar received his

1409
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,410
recognition in DC it was at this

1410
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,210
graduation event that he got the

1411
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:30,899
honorary doctorate degree at South

1412
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:33,990
Dakota State University in 1955 he

1413
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:38,309
received a letter from the John Scott

1414
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:43,139
metal award people so the John Scott

1415
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:44,639
award is very prestigious might not have

1416
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:47,339
ever heard of it and I didn't hear of it

1417
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,920
until after I was diving in the McFadden

1418
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,660
but it goes to the most deserving men

1419
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,360
and women whose inventions have

1420
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:57,779
contributed to some outstanding outcome

1421
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:00,750
and it started in the early 1800s by

1422
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:03,269
John Scott he was a Scottish druggist

1423
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:06,380
and he entrusted money to the city of

1424
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:09,030
Philadelphia which was the heart of our

1425
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:11,760
innovation it was the Silicon Valley of

1426
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:14,760
the United States back in the day and so

1427
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,010
he gave this money in trust to the city

1428
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,490
of Philadelphia to periodically

1429
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:22,440
recognize those people that make

1430
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:25,379
monumental innovative contributions to

1431
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,780
society and some other recipients have

1432
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,269
been Madame Curie and Thomas Edison the

1433
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,970
Wright brothers Jonas Salk you recognize

1434
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:35,730
all of those names and he got a letter

1435
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:38,009
saying we would like to know about you

1436
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:40,740
because we're considering you for for

1437
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:43,200
this honor and he wrote back saying I

1438
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:45,750
didn't invent stem rust resistance it's

1439
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,199
part of nature so they had to convince

1440
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:50,300
him to be cooperative

1441
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:54,289
they asked elven statement to support

1442
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:55,330
his nomination and elven kind of said no

1443
01:06:54,289 --> 01:06:58,340
one really special

1444
01:06:55,329 --> 01:07:00,230
because we were releasing fat sure and

1445
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:02,410
other other lines as well and that was

1446
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:04,969
that was elven statement really

1447
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:09,679
nevertheless they were persistent and

1448
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:12,079
they conferred this honor on to Edgar

1449
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:17,449
McFadden he received it at the Americans

1450
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:19,969
are the Triple A s meetings in I think

1451
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:25,789
it was in Atlanta in December late

1452
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:29,230
December of 1955 and then ten days later

1453
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:29,230
that you're passed away

1454
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:37,670
so um there's this headstone Cindy and I

1455
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:39,769
have visited his headstone in in College

1456
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:44,509
Station and it says a workman that

1457
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:48,468
needeth not be ashamed he fell in his

1458
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:51,228
sleep through this work I've gotten to

1459
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:53,539
know the family very closely a Cindy and

1460
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:55,909
I are both honorary family members they

1461
01:07:53,539 --> 01:07:58,849
call us cousins and all of this so we're

1462
01:07:55,909 --> 01:08:02,509
very much involved in this this effort

1463
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:05,989
as a family so he was a workman that

1464
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:07,579
needeth not be ashamed just think about

1465
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:11,858
what he went through he was the son of

1466
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:11,859
pioneers and community developers

1467
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:20,670
he himself was a farmer and he practiced

1468
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:23,159
agricultural science made a life of

1469
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:26,630
commitment self self-sacrifice and a

1470
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:29,849
commitment to science he was self driven

1471
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:32,548
self-motivated he often called how how

1472
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:34,319
proud he was as a veteran that he did

1473
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:37,769
the nation's called with the colors I

1474
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,630
like that that term that he used he used

1475
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:41,850
another term that I forgot to mention

1476
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:43,770
that I loved and that was radical plant

1477
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:45,660
reading this this notion of

1478
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:48,450
interspecific crosses a hundred years

1479
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:51,239
ago it was thought to be impossible he

1480
01:08:48,449 --> 01:08:53,220
called that radical plant reading and he

1481
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:56,130
would talk give seminars on radical

1482
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:58,470
plant reading and I hope all of you that

1483
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:00,750
are plant breeders or radical plant

1484
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:04,170
breeders as well to carry forward that

1485
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:07,680
legacy numerous crop varieties that he

1486
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:09,180
released in his career and I believe he

1487
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:13,980
was the most innovative plant reader

1488
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:16,770
during that preview time 1913 to 1956 so

1489
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:19,318
with that that's the end of my talk you

1490
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:21,600
know thank you so much for this welcome

1491
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:29,370
and for a great audience I can take some

1492
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:31,170
questions if we if there's time this has

1493
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:36,710
been a production of Cornell University

1494
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:36,710
on the web at Cornell edu
