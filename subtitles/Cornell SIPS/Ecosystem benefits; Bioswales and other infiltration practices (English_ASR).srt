1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,388
okay so the idea today is to hear about

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,000
bioswales infiltration practices and

5
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:43,908
what we've done on Cornell campus show

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:47,049
you how we did it what's and so we'll

7
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:49,128
spend some time in here seeing those

8
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,959
practices and seeing what we've done and

9
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:53,869
how we did it and then we'll go outside

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,319
I hope the weather holds off and we'll

11
00:00:53,869 --> 00:01:00,078
see before Soren shows up and we'll see

12
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:02,359
the two BIOS girls who were specifically

13
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,930
talking about this is a really

14
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,890
impressive just one thing to talk about

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:15,740
them it's something else to see

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:19,719
evolution form after a year two years

17
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:23,089
three years what your expectations but

18
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:30,650
if you do them correctly you should join

19
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:33,680
them in Coraline okay so ecosystem

20
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,990
services are an ecosystem benefits we

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,460
lie on the landscape to provide many of

22
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:40,159
these and you've heard about this term

23
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,379
ecosystem services or benefits and they

24
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,780
relate to storm water reduction air and

25
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:47,289
water quality improvement energy

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,230
conservation carbon sequestration

27
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:53,840
keeping carbon in the plants urban heat

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,120
island mitigation and habitat for

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,040
pollinators and animals and so we're

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,770
going to specifically look at the storm

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,590
water reduction aspect of ecosystem

32
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:05,239
services but they do have other aspects

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,890
in terms of some of these other services

34
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:11,719
that we get and what a stormwater rain

35
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,750
or snowmelt that does not directly

36
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,539
infiltrate the soil impervious service

37
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,489
in the US has estimated be forty three

38
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,689
thousand square miles about 400 square

39
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,509
miles is added

40
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:25,219
year and that paved surfaces is what

41
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:28,459
prevents water from infiltrating in the

42
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,740
ground compacted soils also which is

43
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,860
very ubiquitous in urban areas a reduced

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,560
water and filtration and all this

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,140
increases the stormwater tax after the

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,659
capacity of stormwater and combined

47
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,369
stormwater sewage treatment plants so

48
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,159
this is important that may cities are

49
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,050
looking at this issue and people aren't

50
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,729
even asked to produce these so we

51
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,380
thought what better way to have this on

52
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:53,569
the Cornell campus teach our students

53
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:57,769
and teach folks who come to hear about

54
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:00,199
it thank you so 81 percent of the US

55
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,630
population is urban and in New York

56
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,879
State 88 percent of the population lives

57
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:06,229
in urban areas just to say that in urban

58
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,099
areas you have lots of impervious

59
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:11,599
surfaces roads buildings cars sidewalks

60
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,909
parking lots and that's where most of

61
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,239
these impacts will be felled and how we

62
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:19,219
can mitigate them and if we see what's

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,379
happening down in North Carolina South

64
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:23,870
Carolina in terms of all the flooding

65
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,209
that's not to say that that's not going

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,310
to be a you know going away with by

67
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,840
using an infiltration link devices but

68
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,000
there's a lot more of this happening in

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:38,360
the urban areas where infiltration is

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,810
very poor so stormwater issues these are

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,459
why we don't want stormwater not to go

72
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,969
into the ground its sedimentation and

73
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,560
trash steam by stream bank erosion a lot

74
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:52,959
of excess nutrients or Ganic and

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,729
hydrocarbon pollution parking lots other

76
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,699
places that are extruding these things

77
00:03:55,729 --> 00:04:00,889
bacterial contamination pesticide

78
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,799
poisoning road salt contamination all of

79
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,299
these things are on the impervious

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,400
surface and getting washed into our

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,410
streams our rivers and because pollution

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,409
that's going to been online today

83
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:18,919
contamination caused by storm water and

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,430
flooding relative to the hurricane so

85
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:26,659
well that's an extreme case it happens

86
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:29,600
in different conditions sometimes

87
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,689
related to agriculture where we're

88
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,540
dealing with

89
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:39,959
Lenore's material closed off that's a

90
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,460
part of strong water events so it's to

91
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,459
get the water back in the ground and not

92
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:46,529
let it flow into our waterways and of

93
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:50,399
course this is not too far from here a

94
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:52,859
few years ago anyone going down to

95
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,560
Binghamton I mean we had huge flooding

96
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,330
involved in that right in the southern

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,120
tier was a tremendous amount of flooding

98
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:05,219
and a lot you know doing to deer in

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,439
dealing with impervious surfaces so in

100
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,940
filtration practices bioswales there are

101
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,250
lots of different infiltration practice

102
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,810
bioswales our stormwater runoff

103
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,850
conveyance an infiltration system that

104
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,540
slows directs cleans and helps

105
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,670
infiltrate water runoff and a plant's

106
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,439
assist in storm water infiltration and

107
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,020
provide ecological values such as

108
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,149
creating habitat and reducing urban heat

109
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:34,019
island effects so plants are a part of

110
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:38,279
it we don't think about all these

111
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:41,629
benefits we're so focused on stormwater

112
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:46,168
and that we're not looking at habitat

113
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:48,360
generation right so on Cornell

114
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:51,000
University we're not going to this is a

115
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,879
mock-up of a sustainability trail which

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,449
we built and are about to launch on the

117
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,279
Cornell campus where we basically call

118
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,589
out different practices which we've done

119
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,199
all in orange here that deal with

120
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:05,819
ecosystem benefits services and we today

121
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,969
we're gonna be looking at this quarter

122
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:13,230
mile long bio swell and these three

123
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,970
linked to not all of these are bio sores

124
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,250
about their some ecological practice

125
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,030
that we'd like to help people learn

126
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,680
about so we're looking at the Tower Road

127
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,709
bio swell and if you go to one of these

128
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,620
there's a QR code you can link to a

129
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,759
website find out more about it and we

130
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,560
think this would be a useful thing for

131
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,509
people just instead of just walking by

132
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,759
landscape they'll say well this is

133
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,668
actually working landscapes a functional

134
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,719
landscape as well as being beautiful and

135
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,719
it's tells the story

136
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:51,590
sustainable non-running okay so this is

137
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:55,220
our site tower road bios well site prior

138
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:58,250
to building the bios well it was a place

139
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:02,440
where there was a nose in parking for I

140
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,439
know 50 years or more

141
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:11,180
anyways serendipitous was never designed

142
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,970
people started parking no even coming

143
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,728
right so very compacted you can see

144
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,919
there's no stormwater just sits there or

145
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,180
goes into storm drains and there's no

146
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,490
infiltration at all

147
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,209
this was the site before we started to

148
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:30,110
work on it and so the idea is that we

149
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:32,478
this is a pretty complex little area

150
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,490
here we have our sidewalk a curb we have

151
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,379
an open curb pitch

152
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,210
so getting stormwater off of the road

153
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:43,550
into this design soil and aggregate sub

154
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:45,859
base it's important to think when you're

155
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,150
dealing with pervious it's not just

156
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,530
getting water to soil the soil has to be

157
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,918
infiltrated fast you have to have a

158
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:57,619
reservoir to hold that so the soil is

159
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:01,370
designed to be a sandy loam with high

160
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,560
organic matter so it's it's kind of a it

161
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,259
holds water but it also drains water

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:10,629
quite fast and it's only about 18 inches

163
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:14,090
in our particular site and then

164
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:16,750
geotextile and then open aggregate

165
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:20,000
number two stone typically would be

166
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,550
anywhere from 12 to 24 inches and this

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,649
was done sort of on a shoestring at

168
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,228
Cornell but it still works pretty well

169
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:31,839
so that's the idea it could be much

170
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:31,839
deeper than that and hold more water

171
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:42,229
right so but on top of Cornell being

172
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,969
where it is on top of the aggregate they

173
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,209
thought they'd have a perf pipe in case

174
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,060
there was too much water and in case we

175
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:52,458
had hurricane Franz come right here so

176
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,679
that there would be extra little bit of

177
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:57,469
slope and any excess water we pull

178
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:00,229
pulled into a storm drain we

179
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,180
or get against this but that's what

180
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,000
happened and on top of this there was a

181
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:08,239
geotextile and then the soil was added

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,860
on top of that so aggregate sub-base you

183
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,470
know provides a lot of storage capacity

184
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,100
that's important to have that reservoir

185
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:19,339
under your soil open graded clean

186
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,730
durable 1 to 2 inch gives you porosity

187
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:25,790
about 35 to 40 percent of pore space

188
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,860
that holds water and the depth of the

189
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:30,230
aggregate be varied provide more storage

190
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,810
volume you know we talked about it used

191
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:37,490
to be that that 20 100 year storm was

192
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:38,059
six inches in one day 24 hours six

193
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,938
inches of rain

194
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,698
of course storm water can be water

195
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:46,849
that's moving by a slope as well but six

196
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:48,588
inches of rain in 24 hours is quite

197
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,800
significant I think that's not a hundred

198
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,389
year storm anymore but it's still up

199
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:57,318
there certainly you can actually store a

200
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:59,899
lot of water in this and a nominal depth

201
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:03,349
of at least 12 inches is what we would

202
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:06,528
recommend although probably 24 in the

203
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,329
point overlooking not just my stories by

204
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:11,299
then george menschell

205
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:13,429
right and so under under the aggregate

206
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,258
you'd want the water to slowly go into

207
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:17,750
the ground as well so you get your

208
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:20,778
planting soil your storage and then

209
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,850
eventually down into the ground so 12

210
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:25,970
inches of gravel a 35 percent porosity

211
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:29,810
gives you at 4.2 inches of water stored

212
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:33,019
and the DP you make it you get up to 6.3

213
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:36,078
with 18 inches of advocate so you really

214
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,629
have a capacity to store water where

215
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,899
you're not going to get flooding

216
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:45,649
happening so after we have our you know

217
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:49,339
gravel and our perf pipe and then we had

218
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:52,750
a geotech we put a design soil meaning

219
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:57,439
that was blended of sand loam and

220
00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:00,438
compost to have a pretty sandy loam mix

221
00:10:57,438 --> 00:11:01,849
with about 8 percent organic matter

222
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:04,669
which is pretty high and that's by dry

223
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,129
weight so we are trying to balance out

224
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:10,099
the infiltration and the support of

225
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:11,360
plant growth this is only five feet wide

226
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,239
okay

227
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,509
so it's and it's got to deal with as

228
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:22,129
well sea salt and a lot of other issues

229
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:27,100
in terms of its narrowness so in 2014

230
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:30,139
with my class we planted it in the

231
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,480
autumn of the 14 you can see they drop

232
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:36,079
curbs here where the water is coming off

233
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:52,188
the road into the BIOS wheel and

234
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:54,528
basically filling up that area right so

235
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:56,208
there's so much education yeah the other

236
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:58,269
thing is that we expect that the water

237
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:00,438
going in here will be cleansed by

238
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,078
microorganisms in the soil and be

239
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:07,308
filtered by the organic matter and

240
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:09,198
gravel itself so again this is a quarter

241
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:14,360
mile long we did this all in one

242
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:21,738
afternoon we had volunteers about 40

243
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:23,899
students has never so again this is the

244
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:27,439
idea water coming off the road and

245
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:29,629
through the drop curb into the planting

246
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:34,578
area and then being stored and then

247
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:36,980
eventually released to the ground again

248
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:39,078
plants are important part of this just

249
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,058
so quickly looking at what plants do in

250
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,748
terms of storm water you've got

251
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:47,328
precipitation and we got runoff here but

252
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:49,428
about and in a canopy where there's a

253
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:51,678
shrub or tree canopy if it's a light

254
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:53,298
rainfall about sixty five percent of

255
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:55,818
that rain will be entrained or trapped

256
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:57,980
by believes himself and then evaporated

257
00:12:55,818 --> 00:13:00,259
back to the air so you can actually a

258
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,759
you know it's light rain you want to

259
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,178
stay out of the rain you go under a tree

260
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,129
as long as it's not lightning and so you

261
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:09,318
get through fall eventually you get a

262
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,899
rapid transpiration from the ground

263
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:14,088
through the tree water being lost and

264
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,129
used and we get water going into the

265
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,259
ground infiltration so that's things

266
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:21,918
stored there as well so all these

267
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:25,039
different activities actually help the

268
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:27,409
plant helps a great way to reduce storm

269
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:35,899
by using the water and trapping it and

270
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:37,370
slowing it down so why yours plants the

271
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,528
roots of plants actually provide

272
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,539
infiltration channels it's been shown

273
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:43,189
that when you have roots in class water

274
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,588
goes down much more quickly than if it's

275
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,630
just straight soil they take up

276
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,610
pollutants like heavy metals help to

277
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,909
hold the soils together

278
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,829
reducing erosion so they'll run off

279
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:56,958
reduce suspended songs which is part of

280
00:13:54,828 --> 00:14:04,489
the cleansing and aesthetic value

281
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:07,939
improve air quality sometimes I'll

282
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:14,120
choose plants you know for the sake of

283
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:17,649
having coins but for about 19% of the

284
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:23,000
population what they're really saying is

285
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:25,458
plant selection so it's gotta look good

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,179
too I mean there's nothing but I mean

287
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:30,679
it's not just question of having

288
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,419
stormwater runoff reduction that he has

289
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,120
to look beautiful

290
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:37,219
we do reduce the urban heat island comes

291
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,799
sequestered carbon plants hold carbon

292
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,990
ring and carbon dioxide and increased

293
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,088
biodiversity and creating wildlife

294
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,990
habitats all these things why we use

295
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:50,920
plants in these installations so here

296
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,680
was right after planting in September of

297
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:58,219
2014 you see the infiltration basins

298
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:02,359
which are crossed up and down this whole

299
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,940
quarter mile long stretch lots of

300
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,789
different plants there and then it's

301
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,120
snowed of course we had winter in 2015

302
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:12,948
and ok a little snow isn't insulation I

303
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,839
didn't wasn't worried about this but as

304
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:18,409
things got worse I mean this was also

305
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,350
what it looked like they later I mean

306
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:37,278
there are plants under there but it got

307
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:38,659
really coarse we of course we had we

308
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,000
plow the

309
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:42,850
roads and the sidewalks and it goes

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,708
right in there but we thought about that

311
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:49,278
before we planted before we chose the

312
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:51,588
plants so this is what the light side

313
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,899
look like in the next year early in the

314
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:58,339
season and then later in the season so

315
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:00,828
plants do come back we do when in the

316
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,899
after if the soul melts and we can see

317
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:06,769
the plants we do cut them back taking

318
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,809
out no dead stems and salt damaged stems

319
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,879
and we cut some things back just to the

320
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,349
ground very simply so that they can

321
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,819
reduce the size because some of these

322
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,040
things are a little bit taller than we'd

323
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:20,899
like this is what it looked like this

324
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:23,509
morning walking by and so it's it's

325
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,958
about mature now it's about some of the

326
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,519
plants are 3-3 1/2 feet tall and that's

327
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,438
about where we want them we didn't want

328
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:49,639
to get something too tall where there'd

329
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:52,219
be so this is what it looks like this

330
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,870
morning and I just want to make sure

331
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,839
that's gonna go through your slide but

332
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,120
these are we took salt readings in the

333
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,310
soil over different times this is

334
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,048
anything over this pink line which is

335
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:08,658
1.5 million Mose is toxic so we were

336
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:11,389
having after snow events we were having

337
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:18,789
quite a lot of toxicity in the soil in

338
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:25,400
terms of salt policy so you can imagine

339
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:27,908
side of that is crunchy and what's more

340
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,048
interesting this year we had a little

341
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:32,570
different situation where as you know

342
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:35,450
April was really cold we had a lot of

343
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:36,918
snow in April which is more difficult

344
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,470
for plants because they're starting to

345
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,659
wake up and now they get hit by a lot of

346
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,419
snow and salt and this is just the

347
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:46,220
longest sidewalk we longer wanted to

348
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,740
look at where most of salt coming from

349
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,269
the road or from the sidewalk so we

350
00:17:48,740 --> 00:18:07,750
looked at booked tested sat both sides

351
00:17:52,269 --> 00:18:07,750
the blue is the salt on the road icing

352
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,479
[Music]

353
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:55,298
what do we do we have so much on this

354
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:55,299
road there's it's expensive

355
00:18:55,509 --> 00:20:02,000
we just do that this is so you basically

356
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,609
take salt

357
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,599
oh there's background is down here below

358
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:12,569
below one so above 1.5 it becomes toxic

359
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,759
to plants and that's milli most per

360
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:17,549
centimeter square so if we take soil and

361
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:21,029
make a solution and we'll do it not

362
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:34,950
Const and we'll drop a electrode in and

363
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:37,019
we'll measure the leaves

364
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:41,549
basically the salt is gonna stores very

365
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:44,069
it's gonna be yeah so we want good

366
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:46,940
infiltration to move that salt away but

367
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:49,109
if we get late snowfalls like April and

368
00:20:46,940 --> 00:21:03,720
that's the time when you get the most

369
00:20:49,109 --> 00:21:05,309
damage okay so what plans to be best

370
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,769
herbaceous plants require pruning to

371
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,269
remove dead foliage that's not something

372
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,460
we want to work with what do you plan

373
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,819
for Carl s pruning reducing the overall

374
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:20,549
amount of maintenance and use plants

375
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:24,240
that tolerate wet and dry because these

376
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:28,559
soils are so well trained they have to

377
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,289
and this is the problem people in basins

378
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:39,359
like this well think about wet tolerance

379
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:43,289
but they won't think about two years ago

380
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:47,069
when there's 1520 days of no rain with

381
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:51,149
drowning soil these friends have to be

382
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:53,099
decent so it's true that most bio swells

383
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,500
I see are planted with wet tolerant

384
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,329
plants it's not thinking that there are

385
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,910
times when cousin rain it gets dry these

386
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,869
are well infiltrating soils and you need

387
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,450
to have a plant that's there'll be

388
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:05,339
drought talk as well has the full range

389
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,539
of ability to tolerate those two

390
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:11,699
conditions so rain gardens I'm just to

391
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:14,009
make the point we've seen these kind of

392
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,809
depression rain garden areas which take

393
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,500
in water and hopefully infiltrate it

394
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,389
into the ground

395
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,058
there's a lot of herbaceous plants here

396
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,580
and the

397
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:24,609
problem is during the winter time in the

398
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:26,138
winter time a lot about plants just have

399
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,479
no structure you have to cut them back

400
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:31,298
it's just a you know it's a muddy hole

401
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,899
so we tend to use woody plants would

402
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:37,240
have structure in the winter and don't

403
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:39,398
collapse so not something I would

404
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,378
recommend people do use herbaceous

405
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:47,739
plants and make a good summer show but

406
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:50,048
then the winter is a problem so best

407
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,269
plants both wet and dry tolerant

408
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:54,999
there's see some of these Salix repens

409
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:57,069
creeping below it's a great plant

410
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,990
it's a willow so it does tolerate wet

411
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:00,970
actually saturated conditions but it's

412
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,589
one of those willows I actually write

413
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:09,808
drought hogs as well so it's a great

414
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:12,970
plan rue scope aleena this is a great

415
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:15,730
shining sumac Prairie flame is one

416
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,649
cultivar we use which is really dwarf

417
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,839
it's gonna be shining sumac straight

418
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:22,388
species can be quite tall we wanted

419
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:29,459
something about three feet max and

420
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:31,990
Prairie flame is that so you that

421
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,360
backers have on the folio eastern ground

422
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,819
so this is you know we sometimes try to

423
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:40,138
mimic landscapes which have this kind of

424
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:42,939
salty drought wet condition a lot of

425
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:45,158
coastal areas have this and backrest is

426
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,619
one of these plants that's native from

427
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:54,429
northern Florida to Massachusetts on the

428
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:57,999
coast swimming now sorbus sorbets folio

429
00:23:54,429 --> 00:24:00,399
false Aurelia Marella HIPAA Fay but I'm

430
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:04,028
no tease right hip buffet is sea

431
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:06,099
buckthorn its European it's used if you

432
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:08,169
buy the big ones and they have fruit

433
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:16,808
then it's used to make juice but this is

434
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:19,538
a male dwarf so this is a coastal in

435
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:23,499
Europe all up and down the coast from

436
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:28,240
Norway through to Central Europe on

437
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:30,519
coastal areas sefa lan 'this is our

438
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,039
native button bush it's a pretty big

439
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,099
plant and interestingly it's

440
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,079
gorebyss we see it in wet boggy areas in

441
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:42,159
the landscape but it also tolerates

442
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:44,199
fairly droughty soil - beautiful and we

443
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,480
are you know that the straight species

444
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,350
will be maybe can be up to like five or

445
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,420
six feet tall Sugar Shack is a cultivar

446
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:57,369
which has red fruit and is much more

447
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:59,620
compact and overall so let's look a so

448
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:01,539
Marella used to call this my Rico or

449
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:05,919
bayberry something we all know about

450
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:07,869
great in terms of salt tolerance and wet

451
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:13,690
and dry time so this is a plant but we

452
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:16,179
know December would relieve Zahn so

453
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:22,830
that's a great plant for this and this

454
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:25,870
is ruse Copa Lena shining sumac and then

455
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:29,559
this is the creeping willow Salix repens

456
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:31,599
beautiful plant we look at Salix repens

457
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:35,490
and the wind just sort of has a

458
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,490
beautiful texture and feel to it

459
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:42,400
this is lusco polina in fall color this

460
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:48,009
is where you see in a coastal area here

461
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:50,410
growing coastal New York just has this

462
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,660
funny little bit of leaf on the REA

463
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:58,320
cassava leaf so it's kind of very

464
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:58,320
unusual a beautiful red red fall color

465
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:03,970
spreads so a lot of these plants are

466
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:05,019
fighting it out on the bioswale that we

467
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,610
expected that to happen

468
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:10,329
some of their gonna win some we're gonna

469
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:12,969
lose it's okay hippo flavor I'm naughty

470
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:16,839
sprite this is dwarf sea buckthorn and

471
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:19,150
it's a real beautiful gray leaf plant

472
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:21,099
that doesn't accept their sexual assault

473
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:26,980
on this you could actually water with

474
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:29,289
salt water and would be fine yeah and

475
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,660
this is backers halima folio which is

476
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,940
it's a native on the coast but you may

477
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,759
not be so familiar with it it comes in

478
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,190
male and female plants it's deiicious so

479
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:41,890
this is the male and has all the stamens

480
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,680
and this is the female showing that

481
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,419
actually seeds that are starting to form

482
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,879
from from the pollen

483
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:50,679
the mail so you get a bunch of backers

484
00:26:48,878 --> 00:26:53,769
and you'll get some mail some female

485
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,749
hopefully oh so it does succeed

486
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:57,819
yeah and it's this is except it's just

487
00:26:55,749 --> 00:27:00,759
starting to bloom now but very late to

488
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:05,470
bloom and this again is a seaside plant

489
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:10,538
that thrives in droughty and wet salty

490
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:13,839
soil Oh so cephalad this button bush is

491
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:15,970
our native plant that you see in wet

492
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,720
areas here it can be quite big it's

493
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:23,048
beautiful in terms of that but it's big

494
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,019
it's also big for our five foot wide you

495
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:28,599
know 18 inches of soil so we prefer to

496
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:31,329
use a sugar shack which has the red

497
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:34,298
fruit you see here much more compact and

498
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:36,220
so it's important to select the plants

499
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:38,259
not just based on species but on colder

500
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,940
burn and there's the envelope of

501
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:43,538
planting an envelope of soil that you

502
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,519
have to support these plants so what we

503
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:47,558
learn best sees the plant we plant it in

504
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,230
the autumn that wasn't a good idea

505
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,648
these plants had not got you know really

506
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,628
rest' AB lished before the snow came so

507
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:58,209
we'd always do it in the spring let them

508
00:27:55,628 --> 00:28:00,009
get established in the summer and then I

509
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,619
mean it's the same plants we you know

510
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:05,528
are out there but we found that they did

511
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:11,769
better once we did spring planting and

512
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:13,690
then they plant for canopy closure it

513
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:16,419
can be closures when the plants knit

514
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,389
together touch each other we don't want

515
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:21,309
to have bare soil because they're sold

516
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:23,888
gives us weeds and so when you have

517
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:29,378
canopy closure much less in terms of

518
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:31,508
weeds and maintenance that way we like

519
00:28:29,378 --> 00:28:33,759
to cut back dormant stem as early spring

520
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,739
to control height eventually and molise

521
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,440
plants come back very rigorously and

522
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:40,119
remove salt on their stems this year we

523
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:45,058
had a lot of salt on their stems because

524
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:45,058
of the late snowfall and a late salt

525
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,700
so um quick overview of the tower road

526
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:55,720
bios well I'm going to see one other

527
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:58,410
BIOS will which is the rice bowls hold

528
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:02,490
that because rice whole parking lots

529
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:06,670
discharged into this area yeah just

530
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:12,069
carrying out there there were three

531
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:14,558
segments to redevelop parking lot here

532
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:18,339
in Cornell and there's no traditional

533
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:22,000
and storm drainage they cross pitch into

534
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:26,859
three basins and at the time Cornell

535
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:33,160
blue please they put turf in the lawn

536
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:38,409
and staff painted it because that side

537
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:43,320
slopes like this and they were intending

538
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:48,009
to Mona so maintenance was a problem so

539
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:52,689
after a year or two we took this on as

540
00:29:48,009 --> 00:30:04,440
our class project both to remediate the

541
00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:09,100
soil and as you'll see we need to plant

542
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:18,298
canopy closure this whole idea that

543
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:18,298
plants are objects need to walk around

544
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:26,129
it's okay that they touch and the idea

545
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:28,570
is that after a year or two Mojang

546
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:31,929
hanging but they're wrong tell me

547
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:37,089
something right so we're gonna see a

548
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:40,960
little video five minutes or so the rice

549
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:44,048
bows more volunteers Howie this was a

550
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,819
three deep bows which where rice hall

551
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:50,109
parking lot discharged into it was all

552
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:51,609
turf initially very compacted grounds

553
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:54,009
folks hated to mode because it's very

554
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:57,399
steep and it was very difficult there

555
00:30:54,009 --> 00:31:00,179
was a sand trench running through the

556
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,940
bottom of each of these

557
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:06,309
Bowles and so but we needed to make the

558
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,110
soil appropriate for plants plants we

559
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:11,160
just couldn't they were so compacted we

560
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:14,019
couldn't get plants in so we use a

561
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,538
technique called scoop and dump or we

562
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:19,019
add like 6 inches of compost and then

563
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:22,029
with a backhoe go down and take that

564
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:37,619
mixed soil up and dump it and bestest

565
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:41,579
just show you how we did it so this is

566
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:44,859
we're taking compost and spreading it

567
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:49,089
about six inches thick in the deep BIOS

568
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:50,829
Wells what you see here you don't need

569
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:58,178
to have forty students to do this it can

570
00:31:50,829 --> 00:32:02,829
be done by machine we don't let them go

571
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:07,179
away just letting you know it's pouring

572
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:09,428
on sign right now so this is you see the

573
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:11,440
flags to prevent getting into the root

574
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:15,309
zone of the tree but we go down with a

575
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,429
backhoe scoop and dump right in place

576
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:22,079
so this compacted soil is kind of having

577
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:24,640
veins of compost through it not

578
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,418
uniformly mixed we get this kind of

579
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,250
veins of compost pieces infiltration

580
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,740
we've done research on this over twelve

581
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:36,569
years showing that by doing this we

582
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,569
actually get better results over time

583
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,659
our

584
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,250
so notice it's pretty rough rough you

585
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:57,069
don't vote it to it we want to keep it

586
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:59,529
in this kind of a state where we have

587
00:32:57,069 --> 00:33:02,589
veins of infiltration and compost and

588
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:05,759
compacted soil we plant right into that

589
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:09,849
and then with a mulch on top of that

590
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,440
sort of look perfectly wonderful but we

591
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:16,769
won't have messed around with the soil

592
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,769
more than we had to as you can believe

593
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:29,220
nothing so this is what this is a spring

594
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:34,870
of 4 2014 right after his plant is May

595
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:37,600
2014 and we there's a long freeze

596
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:40,419
bioswales here four months later it's

597
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:44,529
now September and things are starting to

598
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,210
grow in a big way this is the rice

599
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:50,649
parking lot and there are infiltration

600
00:33:46,210 --> 00:34:00,789
zones into this one two three cause you

601
00:33:50,650 --> 00:34:03,100
can see in the corner so that's where it

602
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:08,829
comes in into a gravel area and then

603
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:10,898
moves 14 months later next spring things

604
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:15,119
are starting to really grow I can't

605
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:20,019
stress enough how important soil soil

606
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:22,359
preparation so no so I'll make up the

607
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:27,280
preparation is key to having these

608
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,289
things work don't sometimes forage plant

609
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,210
selection is key but without soil all

610
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:38,918
the plants left in the world go down the

611
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:48,880
tubes so this was a couple of summers

612
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:51,759
ago it's really but most of these are

613
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,769
woody plants and very unusual group of

614
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,020
plants summer right again wet current

615
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:58,389
and drought tolerant especially on the

616
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:00,849
bottoms of the swells where we really

617
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:02,379
will get more water on the sides you can

618
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:07,568
get away with

619
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:11,680
sweat tolerant plants do have a few

620
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:15,880
grasses only because when they plow guy

621
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:21,308
for snow in these basins I scrape the

622
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,318
soil okay

623
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:27,130
so I'm gonna try to show you another

624
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:29,998
infiltration practice which has now been

625
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:33,960
going on for 15 years this was a

626
00:35:29,998 --> 00:35:36,578
proposed parking lot area near the inlet

627
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,858
downtown Ithaca and that there's a trail

628
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:40,420
here and the city wanted to have a it

629
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:44,739
was a parking at a trailhead parking

630
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,838
area that was much better functioning

631
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:49,720
instead of this sort of muddy area and

632
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:52,210
so we were working on something called

633
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,759
structural soil which is a gravel soil

634
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,889
mix which is very highly infiltrating I

635
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:59,679
thought well let's try porous asphalt

636
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:01,389
and impervious asphalt and look at

637
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,118
structural soil and planting trees in

638
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:08,889
here to see how this works and it's now

639
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:12,630
15 years of this practice so structural

640
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:15,728
soil we took off all that top of the

641
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,440
existing parking lot we went down 24

642
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:19,718
inches which structural soil which is a

643
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,999
mixture of stone and soil very highly

644
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,849
and infiltration very fast infiltration

645
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:26,759
even when compacted so structural soil

646
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:30,460
of the essence of it it is that

647
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:33,309
compacted it holds up pavement sidewalks

648
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,259
it can be compacted to 95% Proctor with

649
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:38,200
no problem at plants roots getting

650
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:42,068
through it so it's a combination of no

651
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:44,548
load-bearing and root infiltration so

652
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:47,108
that's what you're seeing here and

653
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:49,538
that's what's kind of a graphic of it

654
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:51,489
you've got crushed stone at one inch and

655
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,249
in between the pores that are created

656
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:57,039
with the crushed stone of one size we

657
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:58,718
put soil in that and the soil because

658
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,910
the stone is touching stone or

659
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,159
stretching stone that's where the

660
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:05,739
compactive effort comes and the soil in

661
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,108
those pores is not compacted so roots

662
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:10,289
can just shoot through that and yet it

663
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:13,028
still is on kind of lattice work of

664
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:16,069
load-bearing you understand get that

665
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:18,798
yeah that's a concept

666
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:23,389
okay so instructional soils if we can

667
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:26,478
compact it - so the mean porosity is 26%

668
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:30,588
soil alone is 34% SOT the tiny little

669
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:33,978
pores compacted the proctor density high

670
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:36,139
density the macro pores the pores that

671
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:39,018
allow water to infiltrate however are

672
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:42,440
very different in soil only if it got 2

673
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:44,568
percent of the soil alone nothing after

674
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,670
it's compacted which has macro pores

675
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:49,329
which allows it to drain where is in

676
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:52,400
structural source 31 percent of that

677
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:55,548
after compaction is allowing water to

678
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,309
drain through so infiltration rate is 24

679
00:37:55,548 --> 00:38:02,420
inches an hour and less than a half inch

680
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:05,089
in oh just soil so realize that if

681
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,479
you're putting a pervious situation of

682
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:10,518
pervious pavement over soil without

683
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:12,498
having something that's going to allow

684
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:15,348
rapid infiltration you'll not get any

685
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:20,929
infiltration and then it fails and then

686
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:24,140
people say seen porous pavement so this

687
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:26,088
is what we did we have a here's our

688
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:29,588
pervious asphalt and this is our porous

689
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:38,838
asphalt here right next to each other

690
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:41,420
that's what it looks like and we saw cut

691
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:46,328
into it and planted right into

692
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,329
structural soil there's more volunteers

693
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:59,348
that's what it looks like under pavement

694
00:38:50,829 --> 00:39:08,239
compacted and it's uh so no it was a

695
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:10,309
2006 I mean these little he's a one and

696
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,318
a half inch caliper trees you see the

697
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:16,009
snowplow coming those trees would have

698
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:19,518
been in the next County so yeah so I was

699
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:23,630
protecting my trees ok so few years

700
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:25,709
later doing pretty well and so far so

701
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:31,200
good

702
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:34,740
chorus and encores and this was 2016

703
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:36,389
from the other side of the inlet back

704
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,309
across and so they've now meshed the

705
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:41,129
canopies are meshed they're actually

706
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:44,329
utilizing all that space and what we see

707
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:47,309
now and person heaven is that well is

708
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:49,309
that the ones in the porous asphalt are

709
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:52,170
slightly bigger than those in the

710
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:53,699
impervious makes sense because you're

711
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,530
getting any kind of water is going right

712
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,838
through the porous asphalt into the

713
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,599
structural soil whereas in the none in

714
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,329
the impervious asphalt order has to get

715
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:07,070
into that little three-foot song cut

716
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:07,069
area before it's going to get into thee

717
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:19,640
so the pH is high there plenty plants

718
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:23,369
that can tolerate this this happen BL

719
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:24,929
yeah and so we then wanted to look at

720
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:27,210
the routes but city with it that didn't

721
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:31,319
like you to dig up everything so we use

722
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,690
ground-penetrating radar to visualize

723
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,160
the routes and the route density under

724
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,559
the structural soil under the pavement

725
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:39,750
and this is gary rafael from dynamic

726
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:44,599
treat systems and we worked together for

727
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,599
many years looking at roots underground

728
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,010
so I want to show you kind of a core

729
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:55,940
rendering of root density so here's

730
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:59,490
trees three and four work plan view and

731
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,320
these stripes basically are pastors with

732
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:04,529
a ground-penetrating radar

733
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,619
the color the hotter the color is the

734
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,800
density the hotter the color the more

735
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:13,710
roots in that space okay the cooler the

736
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,410
color there's no roots or very few roots

737
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:19,139
so you can see there's you know more

738
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:20,579
roots here next to the trees but there's

739
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:22,980
a lot of places where it's pretty cool

740
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:25,230
not a lot of roots so remember this is

741
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,699
I'm going to show this is roots under

742
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:32,519
impervious asphalt in structural soil so

743
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:35,639
I'm going to show you what roots look

744
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:38,239
like in pervious asphalt saying with

745
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,239
structural soil

746
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,650
so the root mass the root density is

747
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:47,440
much much greater in structural soil

748
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,000
with pervious asphalt so even if the

749
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,610
trees weren't going well you're getting

750
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,070
a lot of stormwater recharge this is 24

751
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,230
inches of structural steel not no need

752
00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:00,010
for a gravel base because it is

753
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:03,340
basically as open as a base so it has 31

754
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,840
percent porosity and pretty well similar

755
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:11,530
to just ask just aggregate and so we

756
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,660
would get 6 inches of rainfall held

757
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,250
under the pavement here and then allowed

758
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:18,329
to go back into the groundwater and the

759
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,150
other messengers at roots to penetrate

760
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:25,449
structural soil they're not contained in

761
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:40,030
the horticultural soil which is the

762
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:44,739
white well the blue line is in the next

763
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:50,530
slide that becomes this an area where

764
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:52,599
there's no more structural soil well

765
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:54,880
there's social sores put in the area and

766
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:57,569
then that was it and then they went back

767
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,570
to regular water

768
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:03,509
[Music]

769
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,300
[Music]

770
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:16,000
so you know structural slow is very well

771
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:18,339
drained and how do you get the water in

772
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,050
I mean there's no way it's you know

773
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,789
structural soil is great but you still

774
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,610
have to get the water in to the ground

775
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:27,369
and that's where porous asphalt or

776
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:31,640
porous paving makes a huge difference

777
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:34,460
oh and I just

778
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:36,949
and with this which is our newest part

779
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:42,019
of our sustainability trail which is a

780
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:43,639
totally porous asphalt parking lot which

781
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,690
we're going to be planting a week from

782
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,719
Thursday

783
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:50,750
our class is planting this and this this

784
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:53,689
is all porous and under there's an apron

785
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:56,239
around the planting area of like eight

786
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,849
or ten feet of structural soil so that

787
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:01,039
ability for roots to get out of this

788
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:04,069
planting area this is regular soil in

789
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:07,279
here and explore more volume that was

790
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:09,830
the whole area well allowing for load

791
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,790
bearing of that paper so Kuno got a

792
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:17,029
grant to do this and the inspiration for

793
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:27,110
the grant the design was done part by

794
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:30,410
Valentina there's a green infrastructure

795
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:33,710
grant program New York State if you have

796
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:36,679
a green infrastructure problem a project

797
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,510
you can apply for this and as long as

798
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:40,519
you document everything and keep water

799
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,040
on site it's mostly about storm water

800
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:47,300
you can get funds to do these build

801
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:49,579
projects which is what Cornell did so

802
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,260
any questions that we are quickly to go

803
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:53,259
outside and see some of these things

804
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:09,829
[Music]

805
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:13,059
sure sure we I think our office any you

806
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:30,829
can speak to and it's not at all unusual

807
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:34,519
to do pavers to as well which is

808
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:41,049
different than for example so coarse

809
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:44,119
asphalt is fairly common course concrete

810
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:45,289
twenty years ago we needed an 80 car

811
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,859
parking lot

812
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:50,329
at the hospital but you still work

813
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:53,210
people say well you have to clean out

814
00:45:50,329 --> 00:46:07,329
porous asphalt also for that first come

815
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:10,670
clean early on I think it was there is a

816
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:14,630
scalable issue and you can't it's hard

817
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:16,039
to balance but with porous asphalt

818
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:27,950
people say well don't you have to clean

819
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:29,719
it out even if you lose 50 percent

820
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:32,299
you're still gonna have very possible

821
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:33,919
tration so some debris some the dust

822
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:37,910
gets in there but you don't want to do

823
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,650
is have anybody sand the parking lot for

824
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:41,750
smoke salt is fine it's going to

825
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,730
dissolve it's gonna go through but San

826
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:49,550
will clog up the pores and that's what I

827
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:53,420
don't own construction today we don't

828
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:56,330
want to clog up the pores so that so

829
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:59,450
again we've had many in the hospital

830
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,949
downtown Ithaca the parking lot and this

831
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,589
new parking lot which would just built

832
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:07,399
and we'll be planting next week is all

833
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:18,500
porous enough I think this is the first

834
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:20,450
major asphalt area for Cornell but just

835
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,570
realized there are some other porous

836
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:26,179
pavement resin based pavements very

837
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:28,130
expensive porous but I seen respect for

838
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:30,859
this it calls for six inches of gravel

839
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,920
or aggregate under that that's much too

840
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:36,289
little okay if you get gravel with six

841
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,119
inches and with a porous surface when it

842
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:40,730
gets to the point where you hit the

843
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,739
compacted soil that just water is going

844
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:45,949
to just go up or move if there's any

845
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:48,259
slope to that so you need a reasonable

846
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:57,710
reservoir or I could get to hold the

847
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:59,840
storm water can't be closure

848
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:02,240
that's the need for mulching and mowing

849
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,940
go away yeah

850
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:10,549
there's no mowing okay there's no grass

851
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:13,700
there until we get canopy closures and

852
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:15,080
then the leaves create some mulch I mean

853
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:17,509
we sometimes you know if there's a

854
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:20,619
little bit just for aesthetics or what

855
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:23,510
more water holding we might mulch or

856
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:27,739
edges are always difficult you can't get

857
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:30,080
canopy right to the edge but we would

858
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,569
typically you know adding organic see we

859
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:36,679
put a lot of organic in when we do this

860
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:37,580
scoop and um and so that will decompose

861
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,589
and that will be eaten by a

862
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:41,659
microorganism over time and we'll have

863
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:43,730
subsidence but we found through our

864
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:45,949
research that if we add mulch every year

865
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:55,480
until we get plants cream their own

866
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:59,049
mulch we won't lose organic matter side

867
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:02,389
escaping and generally speaking

868
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:04,670
customers in Washington these areas so

869
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:06,829
everywhere and they have disposable

870
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,650
income typically they understand and

871
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:11,449
they're willing or interested in doing

872
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:14,960
permeable driveways and things ominous

873
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:17,119
but cost is generally big issue in the

874
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,130
comparison between traditional paving

875
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,750
services and now is sure additional

876
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:23,360
February as new money has bought the

877
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:26,030
concrete side the cost is also a stomach

878
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,720
well that's partly the course house

879
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:32,960
phone not so much the asphalt itself but

880
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:36,589
because we're excavating in open four

881
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,470
inches versus a niche there's both an

882
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:45,920
exclamation and base course material

883
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:51,369
which really adds regulation yeah

884
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:55,430
someone's gonna decide that runoff is a

885
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:58,489
critical issue you know what I think we

886
00:49:55,429 --> 00:50:02,710
wanted before I forget we provided a

887
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:06,529
handout over here you can go online

888
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:09,369
videos booklets about the plants and so

889
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,370
on there's a little

890
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,489
yeah we have a big website which all

891
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:18,189
this information is there for free

892
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:19,839
please take it and utilize it go look

893
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,369
around there's lots of things to see on

894
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,460
that website

895
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:26,679
yeah another thing I one thing we also

896
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,409
have noticed with the porous asphalt is

897
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:30,639
that you have to have a big enough job

898
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:35,079
because the asphalt plants have to clean

899
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:39,699
out a bay to put this new mix in and if

900
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:42,159
it's too small it's a cost to them so a

901
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:45,669
bigger project would be more

902
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:48,789
cost-effective you know some contractors

903
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:53,730
are getting used to doing it now 15

904
00:50:48,789 --> 00:51:02,019
years ago it was mr. it's becoming

905
00:50:53,730 --> 00:51:04,900
second nature well then don't put fines

906
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:13,150
in it most asphalt as you saw from that

907
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:19,200
picture of course look course look

908
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:19,200
really chunky so normally in asphalt

909
00:51:24,900 --> 00:52:00,460
[Music]

910
00:51:28,079 --> 00:52:03,130
and stick them together I know try to I

911
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:07,420
place to mitigate our stormwater runoff

912
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:10,329
in different ways that's helpful how is

913
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:12,849
the state responding to this kind of

914
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:15,059
mitigation we're looking at you know 65

915
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:17,329
million dollars that have been put into

916
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:22,429
harmful other ones

917
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:25,500
well ultimately Jane determines

918
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:33,659
acceptable practice and they do now

919
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:38,070
except you know what the state requires

920
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:41,719
or allows for in terms of practices so

921
00:52:38,070 --> 00:53:03,240
you need to keep up containment jzc

922
00:52:41,719 --> 00:53:06,569
acceptable long time ago no and I think

923
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:10,319
you need to decide you know where that

924
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:11,100
your water bodies are you know I I'm not

925
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,220
you know

926
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:17,369
many of these things are not the Silver

927
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:20,029
Bullet they're a part of a bigger set of

928
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:24,269
practices we're not going to find a

929
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:26,640
practice that solves for all the things

930
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:28,380
that people are looking for so

931
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,179
forgetting a lot of organic runoff

932
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:34,010
that's just feeding the algal blooms you

933
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,009
need to find out where that is

934
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:41,240
agriculture sometimes as homeowners that

935
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:55,730
fertilize gratuitously

936
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:57,419
because spots you and so I mean that's

937
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:59,909
you know that's when you have

938
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,430
exceptional organic runoff is when you

939
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:04,589
get the algal blooms and if you can get

940
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:07,230
that you know all that runoff in the

941
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:10,079
ground it would be we'd reduce that

942
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:13,190
problem but it's it's a bigger problem

943
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,190
than just one parking lot

944
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:37,670
Liman we do know well we're doing we do

945
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:41,329
it to establish the plants it would just

946
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:42,889
be initial maybe one year in a dry spell

947
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:46,789
while the plants are getting their roots

948
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:48,829
in the ground after that choice a plant

949
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:51,099
should the end of choice of soil she'll

950
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:54,380
be able to handle that we don't irrigate

951
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:56,659
period I mean otherwise it's sort of

952
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:59,900
counterintuitive in terms of what we're

953
00:54:56,659 --> 00:55:01,779
trying there again choosing wet and dry

954
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:05,570
tolerant plants once they're established

955
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:07,100
it's not initial once you plant again

956
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,690
they're still in their pots or whatever

957
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:11,210
and they roots haven't really explored

958
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:13,610
that soil once they've had a year or so

959
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:16,220
to do that then they really take off in

960
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:19,250
terms of their abilities this has been a

961
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:23,469
production of Cornell University on the

962
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,469
