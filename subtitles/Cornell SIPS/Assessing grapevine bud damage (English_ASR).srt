1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:16,320
University it's March 11th

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:18,278
2014 and we have had a very cold winter

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,399
I'm at the Lancing research Farm we hit

5
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,160
minus 10 here on January 22nd and then

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,198
had several other instances where we

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,599
went below zero so Adam and I are out

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,000
here cutting buds to see what's alive

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,399
and what's dead and so I wanted to show

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,320
you how this process works and so what

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,600
we do is we use a razor blade and cut a

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,119
way up Buds and look at what's alive

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,600
inside and so we're going to zoom up on

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,640
a bud here and you need to remember that

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,079
great buds are what we call compound

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,039
Buds and So within each Bud that we cut

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,600
there's actually a primary a secondary

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,359
and a tertiary bud and I found a great

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,559
example here for what's alive so what

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,760
I've done is come in here and that's

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,878
what the bud looked like I sliced it

22
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,000
with the razor blade opened it up and

23
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:08,798
you can actually see the three buds here

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,118
this Center one is the primary and

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,159
there's the secondary and then there's a

26
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,959
little Green Dot over here and that's

27
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,320
the tertiary bud so this is great we can

28
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,478
look at the other side of the bud here

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,199
too and you can see those green dots

30
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,519
those are buds that are still alive

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,359
after this winter they all have the

32
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,679
potential to produce shoots so what will

33
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,438
happen is the primary will grow first

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,200
and as long as it grows well it's

35
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:36,158
unlikely the secondary or the tertiary

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,118
will ever grow if we move up the cane

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,799
here is another bud that I cut uh and in

38
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:44,840
this you can see that the center of that

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,200
is actually Brown and so that's our

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,560
primary Bud the primary bud is dead it's

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,759
been damaged by the cold but you can see

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,600
a little bit of green on either side of

43
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,200
that that's the secondary and the

44
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,399
tertiary and those are both

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,520
alive so this is what we do pre pruning

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
if we've had some cold damage is that we

47
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,840
go through we actually cut these buds

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
with a razor blade and look at What

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,080
proportion are alive and What proportion

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,599
are dead because that will tell us how

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,560
many buds we want to leave on the vine

52
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,598
because I'll know for example that to

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,878
balance this Vine I want to have in this

54
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,759
example maybe about 30 live choots but

55
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,000
if I cut these and I know that only

56
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,639
about half of them are alive that means

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,318
I actually need to leave six0 nodes

58
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,919
rather than 30 to get my 30 shoots

59
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,878
through the growing season so in many

60
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,518
years if we haven't had cold damage we

61
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,919
don't bother doing this but in a year

62
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,158
like this where we're seeing a lot of

63
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,958
damage in the finger legs we go through

64
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,399
and cut some buds first so we get a

65
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,759
sample and figure out what's alive and

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,800
what's dead so we know how many more

67
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,799
buds we need to leave when we do our

68
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:05,439
pruning so it's it's March 11th

69
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,519
2014 and I'm in the Lancing Vineyard

70
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,439
we've had a very cold winter and we've

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,759
had some bud damage that I wanted to

72
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,719
show you so I've cut some buds here and

73
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,239
this is something that we frequently do

74
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,680
before pruning if we've had cold events

75
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,680
because we want to see how many of our

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,400
buds are alive and how many of our buds

77
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,480
are dead because the number of buds

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,120
we're going to leave on a vine uh we'll

79
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,280
know the number we need to be have a

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,840
balanced Vine for example it might be 30

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,719
in this situation and so if I know half

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,039
the buds are dead I've got to leave 60

83
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,719
buds so that I have 30 shoots so I've

84
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,318
cut some buds here and I wanted to show

85
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,158
you uh you need to remember that great

86
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,679
buds are actually compound Buds and So

87
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,878
within every bud there's actually three

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,799
smaller Buds and this is one where

89
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,878
everything's dead but you can see a

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,040
bigger set of circles here that's the

91
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,560
primary bud this is the secondary bud

92
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,239
and this little one over here this

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
little wedge is called the tertiary bud

94
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,878
and on this one when we cut it open all

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,759
three are dead so the primary the

96
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,679
secondary and the tertiary are all brown

97
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,120
nothing is growing from that bud this

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,640
year the second one here it's a little

99
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,680
harder to see uh because the primary

100
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,560
secondary and tertiary are actually

101
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,120
alive here so this little middle Green

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,240
Point here this is our primary bud it's

103
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,759
alive and well if I had not cut it it

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,560
would grow into a chute there is our

105
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,319
secondary bud and there is our tertiary

106
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,120
over here which is alive too so normally

107
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,800
it's the primary that will die first so

108
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,399
it's easy to find buds here where the

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,560
primary is dead but the secondary is

110
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,000
alive and in that case the secondary Bud

111
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,319
would actually grow and be a chute in

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,519
many cases it's not as fruitful as a

113
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,399
primary Chute uh the fruit will come out

114
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,240
a couple of weeks later and so it has

115
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,319
less time to mature through the growing

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,038
season sometimes it won't be a fruitful

117
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,159
shoot but at least there'll be a shoot

118
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,120
there if the secondary is alive and the

119
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,639
primary is not but in this case we're

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,160
hoping to find lots of buds like this

121
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,240
because we want to see an alive primary

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
secondary and tertiary

123
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,960
bud this has been a production of
