1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,839
University so well thank you for this uh

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,320
invitation um I have to give a a bit of

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,560
an uh uh disclaimer that it so I'm going

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,118
to give really a it's kind of a public

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,919
uh relations event um so I'm going to

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,160
give it a talk that and is a version of

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,240
a talk that I gave at the

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:35,039
bti I'm very well Amplified it feels

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,159
um and um that it's Magdalene Lindberg

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:42,479
who invited me to uh come and give it

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:46,198
again uh here and uh so I'm going to

13
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:48,679
point to um One Vision of the

14
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:52,320
opportunities and uh try to illustrate

15
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:56,159
it with uh projects that I know of

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,359
around campus um around uh heavily the

17
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,119
College of Engineering um but also

18
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,118
physical sciences and I'll put in a few

19
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:08,079
um uh projects that from published work

20
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:11,359
from uh other places in the world um and

21
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:14,319
but I'll start out with a a naive um

22
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,079
Outsiders perspective on why why uh

23
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,359
plant scientists might look more to

24
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:24,519
these uh emerging and future physical

25
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,118
science tools uh if I'm offensive it'd

26
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,000
be it'd be good if you told me because

27
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,319
so I won't continue to be offensive

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,879
about my uh assumptions about the state

29
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:38,319
of plant science and uh important

30
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:40,798
questions uh so uh I come to this having

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,199
um interacted with plant scientists here

32
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,118
and elsewhere but also having um been

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,759
part of a a big uh growth area at

34
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:52,759
Cornell in uh looking at engineering

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,478
questions in biology and uh I was very

36
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,159
naive early on to in in thinking that uh

37
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,200
but not completely wrong in thinking

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,479
that there are a lot of similarities

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,200
between the organism scale uh as well as

40
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:10,639
the cellular and molecular scale of U

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,598
Mamon systems and uh plant systems um

42
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,238
now that's of course a very coarse view

43
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,079
but uh in terms of Technology

44
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,840
development there's reason to believe

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,920
that the the analogies can be powerful

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,319
and there maybe translation from one to

47
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,518
the other now why bring up mammals in a

48
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:27,318
plant science department well it's

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,879
because they the Maman biologists in

50
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,399
particular in the biomedical field have

51
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,598
heavily engaged engineers in technology

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,480
development at to a level that I I think

53
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,878
is you know uh well maybe scales with

54
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,679
the size of human biology relative to

55
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,239
plant science but there's been a lot of

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,159
Technology development in these past uh

57
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,519
decades and so uh one way to say is why

58
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:52,158
not bring bio nanot technology and other

59
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,680
Technologies to plant science well one

60
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:59,000
is that they they' they've gone to human

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,920
biology they've gone from uh being

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,878
molecular tools through cellular tools

63
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,958
through being uh clinical tools that our

64
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,560
interfaces with the living organism so

65
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,360
it doesn't have to be dissected uh and

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,519
I'll point to some of these examples

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:18,239
that ought to be able to be uh and uh

68
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:22,879
translated in some form to um plant

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,200
biology and uh agriculture now working

70
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,798
in attempts to bring technology to

71
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,399
plants I understand also that there are

72
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,560
important differences that in in some

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,799
ways it's harder plants don't let you in

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,598
as easily um they don't have soft skin

75
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,239
often um and disrupting them can have

76
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,719
dire consequences that uh and in some

77
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,519
ways mamalian systems are more uh

78
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:52,639
agreeable to some of these interventions

79
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,280
okay I I I highlight the hypmic needle

80
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,238
because this is one of the absolute

81
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,360
workhorses of human of of biom medical

82
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,319
intervention and I would argue that

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,799
essentially we don't have a hypmic

84
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,119
needle uh for plants um and there are

85
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,438
important reasons why we don't but we

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,000
it'd be awful nice if we did

87
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:16,798
um so agriculture uh I think a lot of

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,120
people think of Engineering in uh in

89
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,638
plant Sciences being things you stick to

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,800
a tractor um and I think that's been the

91
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,478
definition of uh for many decades um and

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,560
it still is an an an important uh Target

93
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,680
um and one way to see it is one one

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,199
thing that has surprised me I was first

95
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,120
surprised to know how heavily uh

96
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,478
agriculture has invested in smart uh

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,360
irrigation strategies 10 million

98
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:48,560
hectares is a re reasonably uh uh recent

99
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,879
estimate for globally um and yet almost

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,360
never is that on a closed loop feedback

101
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,000
because they don't ask the plants how

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,680
much water they want or ask even the

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,439
soil and so here you have what is an

104
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,000
Advanced approach uh Running Free

105
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,199
Running on somebody's intuition about

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,918
what um what should be going on in terms

107
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,520
of uh irrigation uh and it's uh and it

108
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,359
for example and this these are topics

109
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,120
that I'm interested in it's uninformed

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,759
by uh parameters that are relatively

111
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,800
coarse but have been shown to be

112
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
crucially important like water potential

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,120
stem water potential that it's been

114
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,639
shown that you know uh crop uh

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,000
productivity quality uh correlate with

116
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,918
uh this one uh simple seeming uh

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,519
parameter in the plant and yet we have

118
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:43,560
no uh uh practical way to go and ask uh

119
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,120
even a sampling of plants in the field

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,800
what their water stress levels are uh

121
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:54,478
today you you the techniques of are now

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,840
mostly 60 years old um and course and uh

123
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:01,680
uh manual and hard to use not giving you

124
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:03,879
real-time data um uh I think there's uh

125
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,360
important advances have been going on in

126
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,560
uh remote senting um I think that and

127
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,280
they can give a beautiful uh information

128
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,959
uh I think there I'd like to see is

129
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,559
bringing into the plant getting local

130
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,198
physiological data uh into that um uh

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
potential feedback

132
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,720
loop uh the other another place that

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,520
I've been learning more recently what

134
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,759
the realities today are are about uh

135
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,318
breeding programs and selection of of

136
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,680
better crops and um here's it seems to

137
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,240
me a a a beautiful challenge for the

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,439
engineering community that most

139
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,560
Engineers have no idea about and it took

140
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,759
me uh uh a number of years working with

141
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,439
plant scientists but for truly learning

142
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,680
the the realities of what it is to

143
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,038
select a a better plant um and so here

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,879
I'm showing science fiction a patch on

145
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,399
that you could a a few Cent patch that

146
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,599
you could go along and put on uh many

147
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:09,279
many uh um um uh crosses for example and

148
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:12,959
get something uh local physiological uh

149
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:16,719
back uh during a growing season outside

150
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,598
um and it was actually uh partly um

151
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,680
meeting with Ed buckler that

152
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,680
crystallized this uh challenge for me uh

153
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
he he and this is a paraphrase but he

154
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,959
basically told me if you can measure a

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,918
trait 10,000 times I'll find you the

156
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,038
Gene and I may you know better than I

157
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,240
whether he's correct about that it it it

158
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:39,560
looks from his publication record like

159
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,680
could well be true um and again uh this

160
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,199
uh this challenge uh thousands of um

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,720
reproducible uh quantitative

162
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,960
measurements on Plants that's a great

163
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,280
Challenge and it's one that uh Engineers

164
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,758
should know about should be going after

165
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:01,399
um because I think it's possible not for

166
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,840
every um uh uh definition of a trait

167
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:07,239
every phenotype every protein but for

168
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,959
some crucial ones and this I got to say

169
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,879
I saw a talk by Pioneer and they and

170
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,198
they it was maybe he was retired from

171
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,680
Pioneer and he admitted that in his

172
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:22,439
opinion Leaf angle had been the biggest

173
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,439
change in phenotype that had defined

174
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,959
increases in yields in their breeding

175
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:29,000
program and that may be an

176
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,799
oversimplification but I I was shocked

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,320
that that what the that these

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,719
extraordinarily sophisticated molecular

179
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,680
biologists uh deal with extremely coarse

180
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,959
physiological information extremely

181
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,359
coarse definitions of what a trait is

182
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,919
and I can understand why because you

183
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,080
have to measure it thousands of times

184
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:50,360
you have to measure it uh in complicated

185
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,800
environments but again it's a it's it's

186
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,919
it's in some sense it's the engineer end

187
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,519
of the problem that's failed in this

188
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,799
project because I know that the

189
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,078
molecular tools are incredible but if

190
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,719
you're applying molecular tools the the

191
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,399
the absolute state-of-the-art and

192
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,639
genetic analysis to Leaf angle that

193
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,639
seems

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,480
unfortunate so I know so I have very

195
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,480
naive again perspective on what uh the

196
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,159
molecular and cellular questions in

197
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,000
plant biology are and so I'm I'm just

198
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,319
giving one example here where I see

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
opportunity and again I was surprised to

200
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,278
learn about the state of knowledge in

201
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,959
plants is here's an example of it's a

202
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:38,278
review saying that um direct evidence of

203
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:42,359
the motion of the movement of a peptide

204
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:44,838
uh has yet been to not been uh achieved

205
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,079
in the lab um and that uh this

206
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,680
particular flowering Locust te uh is the

207
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,559
in in 2013 was said to be the only

208
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,958
example of long range signaling bio

209
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:59,919
protein in the plant in a plant and uh

210
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,799
this seems like again this is uh a

211
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,639
challenge across uh biological Fields

212
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,439
but to uh integrate information

213
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,120
extremely sophisticated information

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,440
about individual cells and molecular

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,919
processes with organism scale processes

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
this is a place where in bi in

217
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,319
biomedical engineering there's been a

218
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,919
lot of it's been a rich area for making

219
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,000
progress uh to get to the tissue scale

220
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,399
get to the organism scale with

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,600
hypothesis about uh with molecular

222
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,039
hypothesis and so it's another um

223
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,879
opportunity so I'm going to uh talk

224
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,639
about three uh perspectives on how and

225
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,078
I'm going to again I'm going to

226
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,680
illustrate them with lots of people's uh

227
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,638
work um I'm going to talk about what I

228
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:51,039
call devices and uh this is where

229
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,919
Cornell has U Been a leader in uh

230
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,399
developing smallscale devices and a lot

231
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,919
of that energy over in the time I've

232
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,759
been at Cornell has been pointed towards

233
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,599
human health um not much of it pointed

234
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:04,919
towards plant science and I think that's

235
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,440
a a a missed opportunity to date uh

236
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,719
Cornell is also extremely uh good and uh

237
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,279
in imaging and I know many of you uh

238
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,480
probably use Advanced Imaging techniques

239
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,519
uh but I think this is a this is been

240
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,879
continued to uh uh be leaders in the

241
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:25,440
world in um in Advanced Imaging

242
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:28,320
techniques um and then also uh models um

243
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,720
they there uh models that I'm going to

244
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,760
focus on not bioinformatic like models

245
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,200
but more um what we call systems biology

246
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,559
models which again look to integrate

247
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,519
information from the molecular across to

248
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,919
the uh uh uh the cellular and to the

249
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,639
physial the full animal uh full organism

250
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,599
physiology so I'm going to start with uh

251
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,200
devices and I'll just point out that

252
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,920
there's a Cornell has a uh tradition in

253
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,320
this uh one of the uh workhorses of soil

254
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,159
science and um agriculture still today

255
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,519
uh was invented here there's some

256
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:09,439
argument about uh precedent but uh the

257
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,679
the Richard soil tensiometer is still

258
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,360
the the only uh tool to measure

259
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:20,198
precisely across uh the plant

260
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,639
physiological range of drought stress um

261
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,958
uh the the few bars of tension that are

262
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,399
relevant to most agriculturally relevant

263
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,078
plants um this is it versions of this

264
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,679
technology

265
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:36,559
um I think many most of you know uh the

266
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,278
Gan gun and and of course both of these

267
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:43,000
came from CS they didn't come from the

268
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:46,039
engineering College um so that's uh uh I

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,759
I I'll C admit that um but I think these

270
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,480
are these are uh two technologies uh

271
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,679
historic technologies that came out of

272
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,839
Cornell um that uh are precedent for

273
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,559
what should be being done here still

274
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,279
today um so I'm going to turn to a

275
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,119
number of technologies that I I don't

276
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,720
know of being used in Plants but I think

277
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,679
could be interesting and so this Irwin

278
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,120
uh devalck is a new faculty member in U

279
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,958
biomedical engineering and this is

280
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,839
something he he's working on today and

281
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,278
this is a publication he published just

282
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,199
before he came here uh and this is an

283
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,278
example of using a microfluidic system

284
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,399
which is a a miniaturized lab that can

285
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,600
handle extremely small scale samples uh

286
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,198
to collect um uh single stranded DNA out

287
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
of the blood um and turns out that is

288
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:36,559
has an importance in the context of

289
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,000
transplant uh biology of transplants um

290
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,278
but this is one of many examples of

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,159
doing um molecular biological analysis

292
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:47,000
on what would have previously been

293
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:50,278
thought of as being uh unusable samples

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,879
the contents of a single cell you can do

295
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,799
analysis on the contents of a single

296
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,799
cell today it's still that's still a

297
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:59,519
challenge but uh it's the uh it's the

298
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,319
kind of advance that is represented by

299
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,240
uh

300
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,278
nanobiotechnology this is an example

301
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,320
from uh Harold Craigs Harold Craig

302
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:12,039
head's group in Applied Physics he is uh

303
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,399
I think maybe the person who coined the

304
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,838
the name nanobiotechnology when he

305
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,159
started the nanot biotechnology Center

306
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,079
here at uh Cornell um and one of the big

307
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,600
themes has been manipulation of um

308
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,359
biomicro molecules in a particular DNA

309
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,639
that has led to uh the beginnings of uh

310
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,320
or the what is now becoming a reality of

311
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,399
of of uh uh single molecule sequencing

312
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,839
um and this is an example I believe this

313
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,639
is an example of mapping epigenetic

314
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,279
change at the single molecular scale and

315
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,799
so what you see here is what Nano this

316
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,720
is a truly this here are the features

317
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,719
that were created in Cornell's nanofab

318
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,120
are of a molecular Dimension and forcing

319
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,040
this DNA to take on a confirmation that

320
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,799
allows it to be literally read uh with

321
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,319
microscopy

322
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:07,639
this is another example from uh Applied

323
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,920
Physics of creating uh a cell culture uh

324
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,440
that uh has uh that that allows uh

325
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,240
electrophysiology to be done with

326
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,680
subcellular resolution so this involves

327
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,480
both the traditional patch clamp type

328
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:24,679
approach but also the cell that is

329
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,879
living on a circuit that allows uh the

330
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:30,078
group to interface with it and uh watch

331
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,720
for events that occur

332
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,318
uh uh to triangulate to where these

333
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
events occurring on a sub a subcellular

334
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,399
uh

335
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:43,000
scale moving up a little bit and a

336
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:46,159
number of these ideas are about uh

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,600
cultured tissues and cells and I know

338
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,639
this is there's a a difference in how

339
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,120
important that is in uh plant biology uh

340
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,000
than uh in Maman biology but I think uh

341
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,399
I I uh I hope that some of these

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,480
examples trigger some ideas of about um

343
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,519
where uh the translation could occur so

344
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,959
this is an example from Mike Schuler's

345
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,959
group who I I I still claim him for my

346
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,159
department he's actually uh shared with

347
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:15,399
biomedical engineering um and this is an

348
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:18,838
example of in fact uh building

349
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,519
um a a mimic a replica of the

350
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,000
connectivity of tissues in a Maman

351
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,440
system and so you see here uh liver fat

352
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,198
kidney um and coupling them with a very

353
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,000
primitive vascular system but one that

354
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:35,919
allows um the metabolic environment and

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,078
the signaling to interact with these

356
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,759
different tissues in a manner that

357
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,519
simulates uh time scales and

358
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,360
Transformations um that occur in the

359
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:50,560
different tissues uh in the in the body

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:54,360
um and so uh this this type of uh

361
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,518
replication of uh of tissue properties

362
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,039
of the tissue environment um is

363
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,600
something that there's a lot of there's

364
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,559
a lot of knoow now both from the M the

365
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,439
material side the fabrication side and

366
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:09,958
uh in some cases uh the biological side

367
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,919
about what are the influences of uh the

368
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,000
the tissue environment and the

369
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,038
communication between tissues within a

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,919
full

371
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:22,199
organism this is an example again that

372
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,799
is called uh uh of tissue engineering

373
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:30,279
effort from my lab of f focus on the the

374
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:34,119
um U microvascular structure of uh uh of

375
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:37,399
uh humans which is um like the FL in a

376
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,119
plant is built of living cells okay um

377
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,240
the the vessels on the smallest scale

378
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,759
are really formed of a of a single layer

379
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,519
of endothal cells that have a huge

380
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,319
amount of biology associated with them

381
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,279
and of course it's a bottleneck for

382
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:55,200
forming any um big tissue is to

383
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,720
simultaneously form its vascular system

384
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,558
if you're going to do an Engineering

385
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,120
Process to form a tissue um

386
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:06,599
I generally and I've spoken to very few

387
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:11,558
people about this but it I wonder uh it

388
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:14,798
would seem AR in naively that uh tissue

389
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:18,158
engineering um might be a whole lot more

390
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:22,599
fun and easy in plants in some ways um

391
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:26,039
that uh creating uh and because plants

392
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:28,918
might just go with it um and there may

393
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:32,599
not be there's not the clinical vision

394
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,919
of bringing somebody a a lab grown heart

395
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,959
but actually today much of tissue

396
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,759
engineering is done to recreate a

397
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,519
multicellular structure to study it

398
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,839
study its biology at that multicellular

399
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,839
scale without there are very few

400
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,158
examples uh today of translation truly

401
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:54,720
to the clinic and so in that same spirit

402
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:58,159
I could uh imagine uh uh that it could

403
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,000
be interesting for uh in uh uh plant

404
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,840
biology

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,839
um here's a effort that I thought was uh

406
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:10,079
exciting um from uh from Northwestern

407
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,678
for Northeastern um not from uh Cornell

408
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,119
but it's an example another example of

409
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,679
creating a a micro environment and in

410
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:19,079
this case uh so again what we call a

411
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,759
microfluidic uh system that has

412
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,599
microscale features that um inside this

413
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,839
cartridge and this is they by creating

414
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,359
that environment and EMB burying in the

415
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:33,798
soil they were able to ex uh

416
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:37,918
uh grow up a huge number of uncultivable

417
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:40,879
microbes and from that um they managed

418
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,640
to isolate um antibio promising

419
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,600
antibiotics that had been un unseen

420
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,480
previously because if you just took the

421
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,558
soil you had to too little too little of

422
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:56,798
any one species to produce that uh small

423
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:59,839
molecule um and so uh this is uh uh I

424
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,359
wish I wish it had been an idea here uh

425
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:05,480
but it's it's an example um that I think

426
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:08,319
it's worth noting that one one place and

427
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,200
in fact Harvey Hulk um as a plant

428
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,639
pathologist was one of the early uh

429
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,679
people that interact with the

430
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
nanobiotechnology center one of the most

431
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,600
active biologists at the

432
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:22,199
nanobiotechnology center and the one

433
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:25,558
reason to recreate these uh mimics or

434
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,440
replicas uh these engineered tissues may

435
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,440
it may be more about uh pathology than

436
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,440
it is about uh the plant biology on its

437
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,919
own okay

438
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,519
um here is uh one of the the first

439
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,240
efforts that first targets that my group

440
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,200
went after was to uh build synthetic

441
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,159
xylm and because plants do something

442
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,480
that Engineers don't that humans

443
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,840
basically don't which is use liquids

444
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,558
under tension and so uh we made very

445
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,319
very simple uh replicas and it was

446
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,599
really more about a materials question

447
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,038
of how how to build a network that

448
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,918
coupled to the outside in a way that

449
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,919
allow the the uh the the fluid in these

450
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,559
tiny vessels to go under tension in the

451
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:13,038
manner that's proposed by CT Co cohesion

452
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:15,918
tension Theory and um uh it turns out

453
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,319
that it's we we from a in a synthetic

454
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,799
system validated uh cohesion tension

455
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,480
Theory um which has nice consequences

456
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,918
physically there it brings us into a new

457
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
regime physically um but I think it it

458
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,840
also gives us an opportunity to for

459
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,919
example understand uh the the design

460
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,158
ideas from the purely physical point of

461
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,759
view of the the here for example the

462
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,120
segmented xylm structure seeing these

463
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:41,200
events of embolization occurring uh

464
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,119
independently as has all long been

465
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,080
proposed uh for the Redundant segmented

466
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:50,678
structure of xylm I've also uh thought

467
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:53,678
that and I've spoke to Harvey about this

468
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,960
before he uh retired that that this

469
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,919
creates uh an unusual environment the

470
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,240
environment of uh the xylm in the for

471
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,400
example where important pathogens live

472
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,640
that is unlike any other environment uh

473
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,519
in the world so what is it like to be a

474
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,919
a microbe that uh lives with uh the the

475
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,639
fluid pressure around it going from uh

476
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,360
zero to minus 20 bars uh up and down and

477
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,520
up and down and so it's also potentially

478
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,558
a bioreactor environment to study um the

479
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,400
biology of uh plant pathogen

480
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,599
interactions one of the things we've

481
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,159
done with this and this was um uh Alan

482
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,399
and laxo uh we were building a device

483
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,120
that ex that extrapolated from our

484
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,840
synthetic tree to put to have a cavity

485
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,000
of liquid uh with and this is it's a

486
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,798
strange geometry but this gray area

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,720
around is is a a nanoporous membrane

488
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,119
that allows the liquid in this cavity to

489
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,400
go to tension when the when it's exposed

490
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:54,079
to a dry environment and here we were uh

491
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,000
uh building it to have direct mechanical

492
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,240
sensing so that we'd have a direct

493
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,200
measure of that stress and Allan came uh

494
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,079
to find out what what this synthetic

495
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,558
tree was and so on and when we showed

496
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,079
him this that we were building as a

497
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,359
laboratory to study liquids under

498
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,678
tension he said oh well that's a

499
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,439
tensiometer and we hadn't known about

500
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,640
Richard in the whole challenge of

501
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,600
tensiometry until that point and uh we

502
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,400
realized that this was in fact a

503
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,240
miniature Richard's tensiometer and

504
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,919
again like I told you we've come to

505
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,599
appreciate that that tensiometry

506
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:32,200
measuring drought stress as a stress as

507
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:35,199
a tension is the most sensitive way to

508
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,519
to uh measure that thermodynamic state

509
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,480
of water and so uh having here a a

510
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,599
strain gauge on a diaphragm over this

511
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,440
cavity allows us to have quantitative

512
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,719
measures of the water potential in the

513
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,720
environment around this device uh and in

514
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
this case this is an this is our

515
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,159
champion of this generation of of these

516
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,519
devices uh we measured uh it went to an

517
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:03,520
embolization event um at uh 300 Bars of

518
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:08,119
uh of tension or uh water potential of

519
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:10,319
minus 300 Bars and just to this is U I

520
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:15,719
don't know if this will yeah

521
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:19,038
maybe uh to actually see

522
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,759
um uh I don't know which of these work

523
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,240
uh but to actually see embolization is

524
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,558
fun that this is the release this is the

525
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,839
click that acoustic measurements here uh

526
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:34,038
this uh atic release of uh of the

527
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,558
tension um upon uh

528
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:38,599
embolization and so it turns out we

529
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:43,319
we've been continued with Allan and

530
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:46,000
Taran uh uh to uh pursue this so that

531
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,000
it's a truly practical for uh plant

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,798
science measurements and so uh here is

533
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,679
our current generation of this device um

534
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:59,839
which is uh as you can see here uh down

535
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:04,559
to a a relatively small package

536
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:07,319
um I'm failing to get a pointer here um

537
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:11,678
and uh this in this format it's just

538
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,079
it's like a pinky a pinky uh fingernail

539
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,559
um and it turns out one of the nice

540
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,918
things is uh that I like is that to make

541
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:20,000
it uh respond fast enough to be able to

542
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,038
catch all of the changes in water

543
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,319
potential that might be occurring in a

544
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,798
plant uh which is where we we'd like to

545
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,038
take Richard tensometer and move it into

546
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,879
the stem instead of being Pur for the

547
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:36,919
soil um is we had to give it a vascular

548
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,720
system we had to uh connect this cavity

549
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:44,640
uh to the outside world uh with vessels

550
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,038
that would as in uh um plants as in the

551
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,799
xylm tissue uh transmit the stress uh

552
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,720
maintain the stress so be uh they're

553
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,200
divided from the outside world by

554
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,360
membranes um by nanoporous membranes but

555
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,360
once inside this device fluid moves

556
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,038
extremely rapidly along these uh vessels

557
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,639
and so the idea of segmented xylem

558
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,519
allowed us to take from our first

559
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,240
prototypes the our first generation of

560
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,798
these devices very long transients it

561
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,679
would have meant we wouldn't capture

562
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,278
things that occurred in less than an

563
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,440
hour to having just few just tens of

564
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,839
second transients that allow us we think

565
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,120
to C capture all dial and so on uh

566
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,199
behavior of of a plant and to do it

567
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,119
across a bring the Richard tensiometry

568
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,600
idea out towards 100 bars so all across

569
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,439
all the way to really desert stresses uh

570
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,278
in

571
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:42,360
plants and we actually have just moved

572
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:45,880
this into uh into plant tissue and and

573
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:48,599
uh we have uh uh trees growing in the uh

574
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,679
Greenhouse uh that so here working in

575
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,319
Branch segments these are actually just

576
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,840
in the last week to actually measure

577
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:59,439
here we apply drying stresses onto uh

578
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,319
this Branch segment um uh and uh can

579
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,200
watch what we've been calling in the lab

580
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,960
dials uh although they're not uh they're

581
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,798
just tens of minutes long and they're

582
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,480
associated with not with true

583
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:11,759
transpiration but with imposed

584
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,319
transpiration um but we are hoping that

585
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,319
this will uh allow us and in a process

586
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:19,240
in an embedding process here designed

587
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,359
for a woody species that just takes a

588
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,679
few minutes uh to get uh real time

589
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:28,839
long-term uh stress information on uh

590
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,640
plants and as part of uh water relations

591
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,558
research and eventually as part of

592
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,759
irrigation scheduling to close that

593
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,960
feedback loop with what is uh a very

594
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:41,359
relevant uh way to do it the plant's

595
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,679
actual stress and this is just a zoom to

596
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,959
see we we're getting we able to resolve

597
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,679
on 10 tens of bar scale we can resolve

598
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,200
uh small fractions of one bar changes in

599
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,120
water potential which of course for

600
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,120
annual species may be the more relevant

601
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,678
scale just a few bars instead of tens of

602
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,158
bars

603
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,480
so that's

604
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,120
uh that's an example of actually

605
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,319
bringing one of these Technologies to a

606
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:11,000
plant here's uh coming to a a leader in

607
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,119
the world of uh making Electronics

608
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,119
sophisticated Electronics compatible

609
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:18,518
with Life uh John Rogers Group which is

610
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,759
now moved to Northwestern and this is an

611
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,880
example of what I think I pointed to the

612
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:28,599
idea of an RFID chip or or patch on

613
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,640
every leaf of uh a field of uh plants

614
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:35,119
and this is this is an example on human

615
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,679
of human application of a a real

616
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:42,319
integrated circuitry on a flexible

617
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,519
adhesive uh patch uh that gives you in

618
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,319
this case

619
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,919
electrophysiological data through the

620
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:51,398
skin uh of this of the wearer and so I

621
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,679
don't know of anybody moving this uh in

622
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:56,199
Plants but if again with the right

623
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,038
inspiration from from you uh it I'm sure

624
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,960
it could

625
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,519
happen um moving towards the field

626
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,798
bringing these things from research

627
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,558
questions to the field is is certainly a

628
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,240
place where there's lots of expertise on

629
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,720
campus you may have seen this this is a

630
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,839
work from the Ericson group in

631
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,759
mechanical engineering uh where they

632
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,079
have uh turned us turned a iPhone into a

633
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:22,158
a relatively

634
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:27,158
sophisticated um uh sensor diagnostic

635
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,640
system for metabolic uh uh uh diseases

636
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,519
and uh uh

637
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,120
symptoms and so this is an example of

638
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,480
engineering all the way towards uh

639
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,119
something that you can hand off to a

640
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,360
non-expert user and uh bring to the

641
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:45,558
field and do uh Diagnostics and again

642
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:47,678
there's this this type of idea from an

643
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:51,158
once you have the idea of a lab on an

644
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,080
iPod or I lab on an iPhone you you can

645
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,320
um there's no reason not to bring it to

646
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:58,639
a question about a biochemical question

647
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,798
in Plants we have a a very large very

648
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,960
strong electrical engineering department

649
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:06,759
uh this is an example Edwin Khan who uh

650
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:11,558
is is very much focused on this question

651
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:14,599
of uh completely wireless power free

652
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:17,639
sensing so all those patches may not

653
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:21,558
even need a battery as with the checkout

654
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,440
counter RFID an RFID is just an antenna

655
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,839
it picks up the energy it needs to

656
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,798
respond to you just from the radiation

657
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:33,879
you send at it and so uh this again is

658
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,480
uh he is someone who be if you have

659
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,240
sensors already and what you need is to

660
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,200
have 10,000 of them that all talk to you

661
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,000
uh there's that expertise uh on

662
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,519
campus so that was my longest section

663
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,679
I'll just give a few examples of um uh

664
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,720
Imaging capabilities we have one of our

665
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,000
Imaging experts here Becky Williams um

666
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,600
there there is a very good shared

667
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,839
facility in while and in across in a

668
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,839
biotech building um I'm going to

669
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,480
highlight one of the things I very

670
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,240
exciting recently which is a

671
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,639
collaboration of uh Matt Patrick and

672
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,359
Warren zipel they're developing Advanced

673
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:15,319
versions of the mic of the microscopy

674
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,079
that I'm showing here and this is a

675
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:20,038
Maman example but uh it's a super

676
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,158
resolution technique and what they're

677
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,638
able what we're seeing here it's hard to

678
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,639
maybe read this scale bar what we're

679
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:30,479
seeing in the Z direction deformations

680
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:34,000
of the cell's plasma membrane of tens of

681
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,319
nanometers okay and so this cartoon the

682
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,079
the the bumps in this micrograph are

683
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:43,319
associated with individual or small

684
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:46,079
clusters of transmembrane uh binding

685
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:49,079
proteins interacting with the substrate

686
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:53,240
um and so uh this is one of the things

687
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:56,199
this is going from Pure structure to um

688
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,440
to Dynamics in the uh current efforts

689
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,080
and it's uh a huge

690
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,960
uh possibility to uh watch interactions

691
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:09,000
at the plasma membrane uh one molecule

692
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,759
one one transmembrane pro protein at a

693
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,519
time this is an example uh that you may

694
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,759
have heard about recently ulie visner

695
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,079
got a very large National Institute of

696
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,638
Health grant for this effort um uh it's

697
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:24,839
in this case he's the the star of this

698
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:27,000
picture is this uh little sphere here

699
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,079
which can be just a few nanometers

700
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,440
across and carries with it uh the

701
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:35,720
ability can carry with it uh uh

702
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,840
fluorescent and chemistry that allow it

703
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,278
to be a detector okay in this case

704
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,359
they're using it uh to carry contrast

705
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,558
agent for an Imaging but they've worked

706
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,759
on this in many different directions uh

707
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:50,599
these little lab on a particle um is an

708
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,359
opportunity to have a truly dispersible

709
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,839
sensor that could be go to the tissue in

710
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,398
an intact plant go to the tissue uh

711
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,959
where you want it and then be read out

712
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:04,158
Spectre scopically for example or by

713
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,519
fluorescence an example not from Cornell

714
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,720
but from this field of uh so-called

715
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:13,000
nanom materials uh here uh from uh

716
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,679
Michael sto's group at MIT of uh

717
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,200
disrupting a chloroplast with a a nanot

718
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,519
tube and what he finds with a simple my

719
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,319
simple understanding is essentially by

720
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,399
putting this carbon Nano tube which is

721
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,558
just a few nanometers in diameter and

722
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:33,000
has tunable electrical properties he's

723
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:36,720
essentially putting an antenna into this

724
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,278
organel uh within the cell and changing

725
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,319
and this is him

726
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:44,319
piercing uh a single chloroplast and

727
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,240
getting a diff getting an infrared

728
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,638
signal from that chloroplast that was

729
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,679
invisible before he put it in they go on

730
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,759
in this paper to claim that this is

731
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,720
improved photosynthetic efficiency in

732
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:59,440
these leaves that were treated with uh I

733
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:03,639
have some worry about that claim but uh

734
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,519
the the idea again of having uh almost

735
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:09,319
molecular scale engineered material that

736
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,159
can uh be part of transducing

737
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,838
information from the cellular scale or

738
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,000
even influencing the behavior at this uh

739
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:20,199
cell and subcellular scale I think is uh

740
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,159
interesting so uh models uh again I'm

741
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,519
going to I'm looking towards models that

742
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,599
uh I know there's a lot of a lot of

743
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:31,199
expertise uh in Cals and U uh in plant

744
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:36,079
science in um bioinformatic modeling I'm

745
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:38,279
less familiar with um uh modeling of uh

746
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,320
gene expression coupled the kinetics of

747
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,639
gene expression coupled to signaling

748
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,480
coupled to uh cellular Behavior coupled

749
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,159
to transport processes on the organism

750
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,039
scale and that's a that's one definition

751
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,079
of

752
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:55,000
systems systems biology that I think is

753
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,960
very relevant to plants and so we uh

754
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,280
Mike Schuler again here I gave him both

755
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,199
his uh

756
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,000
departments biomedical engineering and

757
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:05,519
and chemical engineering is actually

758
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,760
famous in this community as a very early

759
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:13,679
uh a developer of uh complete um

760
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:18,839
treatments of uh uh cell Behavior here

761
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:20,598
starting with uh uh microbes uh bacteria

762
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,639
but what I mean by complete in this case

763
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,440
the definition of complete is that he

764
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,639
has a set of differential equations that

765
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,320
are self-

766
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:32,559
sustaining

767
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,480
alive and respond to metabolic stimuli

768
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,639
and so on in a way that is reasonable

769
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,838
including Gene regulation okay and so

770
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,239
going from Gene regulation gene

771
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:47,679
expression through to uh metabolism um

772
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,559
those are tractable there are a large

773
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:53,440
number of tractable Mo models for uh

774
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:58,519
procaryotes and UK carots uh to be

775
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:02,119
worked with uh uh to to ask questions um

776
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:05,838
Jeff Varner in uh my department is uh

777
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:09,640
somebody who uh is uh one of the people

778
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:11,639
who push this to uh e extremes of of

779
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,598
completeness in terms of the number of

780
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,799
molecular players they're willing to put

781
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,400
into such a model of the cell um again

782
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,440
going from uh going from gene expression

783
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,960
uh signaling uh uh internally and uh

784
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,599
with the external environment um and in

785
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,000
this case uh moving to a multiscale

786
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,400
consideration of how a cell uh evolves

787
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,440
in its tissue context and so with

788
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,160
signals coming from other parts of the

789
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,358
tissue and through vasculature for

790
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:47,838
example other other parts of the

791
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:50,799
organism highlight an uh effort with uh

792
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,960
Bob Turon that I've been involved in uh

793
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,318
on uh the questions of flow and loading

794
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,760
and here's an example of uh where

795
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:03,679
focused on the uh the biochemistry

796
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,440
associated with um flam loading and

797
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,960
transport

798
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,358
questions uh very detailed questions

799
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,358
about plasma desmal the physics of

800
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:16,598
plasma desm desata and how they uh

801
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:20,119
regulate what goes what gets loaded um

802
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:23,240
and we do this we we claim uh and I

803
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,760
believe that we understanding the

804
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:28,039
implications uh the design ideas that

805
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,839
are represented by plasma desata

806
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:35,079
uh requires some accounting for the full

807
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:38,159
organism scale uh uh coupling that this

808
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,720
is what the the the concentrations water

809
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:46,118
potentials that Define transport very

810
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:49,559
locally in the uh at the uh mesil flum

811
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:51,680
interface in the leaf are coupled to

812
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,880
throughout the entire plant and so that

813
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,199
again is an example of uh where

814
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,559
different levels of what could be

815
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,598
defined as a systems biolog approach can

816
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,519
lead to hypotheses that then lead to

817
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:07,200
experiments and it's a it's it's a a

818
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,239
useful C iterative process that I think

819
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,279
is uh not done

820
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:13,799
enough so I just there here I can share

821
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,920
these slides there are a number of other

822
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:21,800
people across uh the university um that

823
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,800
uh uh most of whom have not thought to

824
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,560
apply their skills to plant science but

825
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,400
um I think a number of them would be

826
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:33,639
happy to um

827
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,079
uh and uh there are again lots of

828
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:39,279
resources I this talk was originally a

829
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,839
co- talk with um uh the the center for

830
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,119
Nano scale physics uh nanoscale Science

831
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,400
and Technology the CNF but I'd also

832
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,599
point to the and I believe they're

833
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,440
represented here uh the um Center for

834
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,440
Material Science um which is like the

835
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,280
CNF uh an extremely uh robust long

836
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,760
longterm effort which in particular for

837
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,519
example has some of the best

838
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,599
microscopists in the world and the

839
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:12,239
absolute best uh uh tem facilities that

840
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:15,480
can be had in Academia and uh uh this is

841
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:19,039
actually Lena uh is uh recently arrived

842
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,838
and recently acquired a34 million

843
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,400
transmission electron microscope and is

844
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:27,880
very interested in biological uh

845
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,559
questions uh so to summarize I there I

846
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,599
there are opportunities that go from uh

847
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,960
the the very most basic molecular

848
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,838
biology through to uh something that

849
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,760
will be coupled to something strapped to

850
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:46,159
an a tractor um I think uh that and

851
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,480
there's it be it'd be very nice to see

852
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:51,358
um the kind of uh interactions vigorous

853
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,760
interactions that have been going on

854
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,119
between engineers and human health

855
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,040
biologists going on between engineers

856
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,240
and uh plant biologist um for if there

857
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,719
are any decision makers in the audience

858
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,439
one of the things that helped a whole

859
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,078
lot early on were seed

860
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,119
grants uh that uh we had no

861
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,240
collaborations with wild Cornell Medical

862
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,519
School and then they started to just

863
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:18,199
sprinkle on these 50k seed grants uh

864
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:22,318
once a year and it was amazing how

865
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:25,598
quickly that um changed um now of course

866
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:29,159
biomedical Engineering also grew a whole

867
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,640
uh program um but I think there's uh

868
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,118
there there's reason for this kind of

869
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:36,199
interaction um I think could lead to a

870
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,960
lot of activity so that I'd like to uh

871
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,679
thank my group um a number of people a

872
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,079
number of collaborators including those

873
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,078
here I think uh Bob I have not gotten

874
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,920
you on my collaborator list yet we got

875
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:49,160
to get those papers out but that wasn't

876
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,760
because of that but uh so thank you very

877
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:53,598
much for your attention and I'll be

878
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,599
happy to take any

879
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,239
questions

880
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:06,440
well there are few sensors in for rux

881
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:16,959
[Music]

882
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:22,000
potential encodable encodable sens

883
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:25,400
yeah well that's that's great but it's

884
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,280
not always that easy to read them and so

885
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,160
I think uh Becky and Warren over uh

886
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:37,160
Warren zipfel over in uh are working on

887
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:40,879
ways to read those sensors which are

888
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:44,480
finicky um and of course always the more

889
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:48,318
folks can get for sensor the better and

890
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,159
working out tricks to uh um calibrate

891
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,880
them and so on so that's a good them

892
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:56,838
that I agree if you can if you can grow

893
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,240
your censor into your plant express it

894
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:59,239
in the

895
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,610
[Music]

896
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:20,558
small um I I do think there are uh

897
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:24,799
physical uh size exclusion steps that um

898
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:30,240
uh animal cells that Lind the vessels uh

899
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:32,480
actively uh and po uh components at

900
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,639
least in the context of Z will not make

901
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,400
it into the you know not make it into

902
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,639
any all they would be size excluded by

903
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,800
border pits for example and challenging

904
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:43,078
they would be size excluded from

905
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:48,760
entering the

906
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:53,240
roof and so that but what that Dimension

907
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:55,440
is is uh not I think is somewhat species

908
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,879
dependent and and not always well

909
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
characterized but I think some of

910
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,318
Nan materials are small enough to be

911
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,439
taken

912
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:09,400
up um somebody in the a may know better

913
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,838
about uptake of

914
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,760
particulate U but but it's it is it is a

915
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:18,440
trick and that's again and you can't

916
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,240
just use a hyp to go into the

917
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:26,119
is or

918
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:28,399
the it'll stop working that's a that's a

919
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,200
frustration so you mentioned kind of the

920
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,240
differing scales of plant versus

921
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:34,679
mamalian trials I mean like a small corn

922
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:37,118
breeding trial might be 10,000 plants

923
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:40,440
which would be an absolutely massive Tri

924
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,440
on rats much less humans I guess what

925
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,240
are kind of in terms of these

926
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,800
Technologies and meleon systems for

927
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,558
tissue sensing what are the largest

928
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,039
scales that people work on and how could

929
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,720
that be modified for the scales that you

930
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,318
know someone we eating like the cereals

931
00:43:52,719 --> 00:44:00,959
might be working well so there are two

932
00:43:55,318 --> 00:44:03,880
two uh so if you uh given the budgets I

933
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,000
hear of breeding programs you could get

934
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,280
people interested enough to make enough

935
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,800
sensors that their cost would go very

936
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,519
low so if I can make enough of myyl

937
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,440
sensors to satisfy readers if they they

938
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,838
if they have a way to use them uh I can

939
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,480
bring the cost in that sensor down to to

940
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,799
to be very inexpensive because it

941
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,280
benefits from the the scaling of price

942
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,079
that micro benefits from um so that's

943
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,960
one if if if there is a if there is a a

944
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:39,240
real investment um the you know you

945
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,800
carry a supercomputer in your pocket for

946
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,919
a few hundred dollars um so that is impr

947
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,160
the other perspective is that some of

948
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,559
these approaches around So-Cal nanom

949
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,558
materials these are can be synthesized

950
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:55,319
by the many on the many gr scale and so

951
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:59,880
that they can be uh if if the delivery

952
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:05,440
can be worked out that um can

953
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:08,119
uh and there's one reader stractor one

954
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,079
tractor might be able to read all plants

955
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,760
and you you have to paint every leaf but

956
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,039
you must be doing something like some

957
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,920
such human interaction with every one of

958
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:23,599
those 10,000 uh species right now so

959
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,880
it's not today I don't if I had it I I

960
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,599
doing something with it but the 10,000

961
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,599
replicas of an experiment out the field

962
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,920
is is a challenge but is a good one is

963
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,880
what I'm saying and I'm hoping I'm

964
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,599
trying to articulate that to to this

965
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,519
community and to the engineering

966
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,039
community and hopefully to the funding

967
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,480
community that there'll be an investment

968
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,079
because I don't think it's there's no

969
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:50,000
reason it's impossible but but what what

970
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,119
do the engineer really need from uh the

971
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,920
plan biologist is what to

972
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,240
measure and it's not just your dream of

973
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,599
what to measure but what is it to come a

974
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:02,358
compromise between what would be the

975
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,960
perfect piece of information and what

976
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:08,960
would be scalable to, because of a

977
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:12,838
reasonable price and so and my feeling

978
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,800
is that the the Breeders uh are quite

979
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:19,279
they don't they don't think about it

980
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:23,839
they don't and this is the the the the

981
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:27,480
gene to trait Gap uh they they're so

982
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,318
focused on the the gene identific a that

983
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,280
they're not worrying much

984
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:36,679
about what traits might be um good if

985
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,680
they could get

986
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:49,480
Beyond it seems like being able to tap

987
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,159
into the flow and

988
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,199
sense

989
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:58,039
small signal through the would be game

990
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:02,719
Cher understanding happening certainly

991
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:05,239
in plant miction there a lot happen

992
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:08,639
and you know there are curious things

993
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:10,959
that could potentially build for example

994
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,960
some

995
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:19,318
ins but are there any ideas you have

996
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,639
well so so I once we we've explored some

997
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:25,800
of these in the CNF for example of

998
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:29,199
trying to so the the proasus the prascus

999
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,200
of uh FL feeding insect can go through

1000
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,719
without

1001
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:36,960
inducing uh

1002
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:40,439
CL that's the right word um and so this

1003
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:43,119
ought to be replicatable um and there's

1004
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,000
been a huge effort on micr needle drug

1005
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,119
delivery for human isssues and so it's

1006
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,838
extremely fine so it's like with p pipet

1007
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,440
uh but replicated uh many times over

1008
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:58,558
with tunable chemistry on the surface so

1009
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:02,838
I that yeah yes I think there is a

1010
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:05,680
possibility there um uh to and I think

1011
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:10,119
the looking to the bi biology so I think

1012
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:12,919
also um uh species like the mistl toe

1013
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,480
that grows itself into tissue without

1014
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,599
disrupting uh tissue the biochemistry

1015
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:21,119
that allows to do that gracefully um the

1016
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,079
suppressors of plant response those are

1017
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,519
those are part of I think of what's

1018
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:28,760
going to have to be um allowed for a

1019
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,759
graceful interface

1020
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah question yeah okay question yeah um

1021
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,480
so you I mean you focus a lot on on

1022
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,800
mechanical properties of course plants

1023
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,880
are engaging a lot of exotic chemistry

1024
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,720
as well if you thought about sort of

1025
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,559
technologies that might be used to of

1026
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:55,039
make sense of of of you know discovering

1027
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,920
a compound or something like that that

1028
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:00,599
that uh yeah absolutely and so I and so

1029
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,960
for example and and and in the examples

1030
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:08,200
I've shown much of the focus has been

1031
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:10,920
about so is is on uh biomes macro bi

1032
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:15,598
macro molecules and small molecules uh

1033
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,519
in terms of uh uh analysis on small

1034
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,240
samples on small scales and cheap

1035
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:23,880
devices that is a big part of what um

1036
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:27,318
the so-called lab on a chip effort has

1037
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:30,440
been and so whether it's uh

1038
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:33,880
the volatiles around the plant or small

1039
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,960
molecule signaling within tissues uh

1040
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,240
it's a good Target it's not one that my

1041
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,838
own group has been um uh focusing on but

1042
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:46,879
there's a lot of expertise on campus in

1043
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:49,400
that uh in that analytical chemistry um

1044
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,400
scale

1045
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,519
down so I like to say that I think that

1046
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:01,838
uh a given us a number of really

1047
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:04,039
excellent illustration examples of what

1048
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,960
can be done as well as some really

1049
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:09,798
stimulating ideas of opportunities where

1050
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,199
I think our community has to uh you know

1051
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:16,119
maybe do some more thinking about how we

1052
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:18,919
can uh address some real breakthrough uh

1053
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:24,440
new advancements by bringing together

1054
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:26,079
our problems with uh you st a toools and

1055
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,039
before thanking you don't forget that

1056
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,039
we'll have a session out in the hall

1057
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:32,039
where we can continue discussion with a

1058
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,279
and also with others from these you

1059
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:37,519
other facilities it' be great to have a

1060
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,400
volunteer to come do the reciprocal talk

1061
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:40,759
in

1062
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,160
engineering uh or volunteer somebody you

1063
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,480
know but uh I think you could to to

1064
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,519
because again they they they you talk to

1065
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,920
students and all they've heard about the

1066
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,400
biomedical challenges they've heard

1067
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:56,039
about tissue engineering they've heard

1068
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:59,160
about cancer uh and they know less about

1069
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:02,039
um problems from Agriculture and plant

1070
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:05,199
science and so it it' be great to be

1071
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,079
talk and we could find a good form for

1072
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:11,579
okay thank you so

1073
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,579
