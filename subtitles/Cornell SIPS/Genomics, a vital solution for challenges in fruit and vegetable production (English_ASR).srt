1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,959
okay uh good afternoon

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
thanks dear for your introduction

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
before i get started i would like to say

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
a few words

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,160
for this seminar

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,599
that is i'll be given it

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,679
as a

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,599
extension seminar

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,599
so

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
my extension program

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,679
targets

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,239
at two groups of audience

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,439
the apple industry and the general

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,078
public

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:46,000
especially

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,280
the master gardener volunteers

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
so today

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,359
i will be treating you guys as part of

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,920
these two groups for next hour

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,439
so with that said

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
uh here's my

24
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,558
outline of my talk today

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,839
i will be basically addressing two

26
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,959
questions

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,000
the first is what is genomics

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,118
i'll be

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,478
beginning with a few key concepts in

30
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,239
genomics

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,359
and then

32
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,079
talk about

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:22,959
major accomplishments in genomics

34
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,438
the second question is why genomics is a

35
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,399
vital solution for challenges

36
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,039
in fruit and vegetable production

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
so this is a focus on my talk today

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,159
i'll be mentioning

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,799
briefly the challenges we're facing

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,880
and then describe the

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
solutions of genomic solution for these

42
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,199
challenges

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,719
i'll be using cabbage black rod

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
resistance

45
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,399
and apple

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
fruit quality as example

47
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,640
so before i get started okay the first

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
question

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,319
is about what is genomics

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,799
so now to answer the question

51
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,799
let's look at this picture first okay

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,840
this one is a really a touching story

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,879
is the slide itself is adopted

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,719
from

55
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,598
a from the fly

56
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,080
of a french documentary made a couple

57
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,079
years ago

58
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
the guerrilla

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
named digit

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,759
uh

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,759
lived with the family

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:35,039
peer and anionic for four years

63
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,359
the the grid has really become a

64
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,519
member of the family

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
but in the end

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
the griller

67
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,759
has to

68
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,000
leave

69
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,000
back to where she really belongs

70
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,560
because the fully grown uh gorilla is

71
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,639
really different from humans

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,319
now from the point of genetics

73
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,199
the difference is caused by the genome

74
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,759
okay

75
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,199
so in other words we can say that it is

76
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,518
the genome

77
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,039
that makes this family must be quick

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
enough

79
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,759
so

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,120
but please do not

81
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,639
uh think genome is a bad thing

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,239
uh

83
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,318
actually it is also the genome that

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,759
make us who we are

85
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,759
why we have such a diverse world

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
for the same reason

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,560
the apple fruits

88
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,719
can be always distinguishable from other

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
fruits such as pear

90
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,080
and

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
peach

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,799
so so you may think it's easy to

93
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,158
understand the difference

94
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,840
between the species are caused by

95
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,759
by the genome

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,719
so what about the difference

97
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:02,158
within a same genome well that would

98
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,759
also caused by the genome as well

99
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,598
the answer is yes

100
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,798
so for example

101
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,919
um

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,799
these are the four types of vegetables

103
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,559
okay

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
but they belong to the same species

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,238
called brassica wrapper

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,000
if you

107
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,638
look at how they differ from each other

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
but if you look at their genome sequence

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,040
probably more than 99 percent

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,000
they are the same

111
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,560
but the one percent difference is enough

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,399
for what you see here

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,959
so this this says

114
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,719
that the genome not only

115
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,758
determines the difference

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,440
between

117
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,560
the species

118
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,478
but also determine the difference within

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
the same same species

120
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,199
a little variation in the genome that

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,520
can make a huge difference

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,520
in their appearance

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
okay talk about the genome what is

124
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
genomic value

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,439
okay in a scientific term

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
genome is a total collection of dna or

127
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,279
genes

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,038
in a reproductive cell

129
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,799
such as sperm egg pollen

130
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,360
that contains

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
all of the genetic genetic information

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,639
needed

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,638
to build a organism

134
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,439
so a genome is really

135
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,879
like a blueprint

136
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,560
for building a magnificent building

137
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,560
such as empire building with all

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,560
families

139
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,038
now

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,038
the dna of genome

141
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,959
contains a lot of meaning meaningful

142
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,120
bases

143
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,120
so if you print the genome

144
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:58,319
there will be a hugely sick book

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,360
so in the upper genome

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,319
there are

147
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,400
about

148
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
750

149
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,478
million bases

150
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,279
so the apple genome book

151
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,399
would have

152
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,758
750 million

153
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,719
letters

154
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
assuming we can print 3000 letters per

155
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,199
page

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,280
that would

157
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,478
count for

158
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,478
a quarter million pages

159
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
now

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,439
in the genome of a

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
napa cabbage

162
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,038
the the genome book will be a little bit

163
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,359
thinner

164
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,360
with

165
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,680
284 million letters but it still take

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
about

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,680
95

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
uh thousand pages to print it all out

169
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,799
so in the living cells

170
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,918
the genome

171
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,478
dna

172
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:56,399
is naturally

173
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:59,680
divided into a limited number of units

174
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:03,839
and organized into a structure called

175
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,840
chromosomes as shown in this picture

176
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,639
so the apple genome have 17 chromosomes

177
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,680
if we're using the concept of book

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,439
so the apple genome book would have 17

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
chapters

180
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,680
now similarly for the

181
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,119
prosecutor napa which is a rubber

182
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,160
cabbage

183
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
they have 10

184
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,680
10 chromosomes so the brassica rubber

185
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,160
cabbage genome book would have 10

186
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
chapters

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,639
now gene is another important concept in

188
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,038
genomics i think

189
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,240
you have heard about it

190
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,399
so genes are the basic functional unit

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
of genome

192
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,560
and

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
genes carry

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,959
important genetic information

195
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
so genes

196
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:05,918
are located at the various locations

197
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,919
along this chromosome

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,839
so a single genome can be a home

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,839
for genes of thousands

200
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,439
the textbook the text box here should

201
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,680
actually shoot a dna sequence for a gene

202
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,399
actually this is the gene

203
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,560
uh responsible for controlling apple

204
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:33,360
fluid acidity we identified recently

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,360
so the first three-letter

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,759
atg serves as a like a start button

207
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,680
for the gene gets translated

208
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,720
and the last three letters

209
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,838
serves for the stop button

210
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
for

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
translation termination

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
the mother letter somehow

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,600
changed the basis

214
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,719
in the middle of the red g g 1455 we

215
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,080
call it

216
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
are two a1455 in some of the above

217
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,759
varieties

218
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,720
that makes those levels

219
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,720
are testless because the lcd is too low

220
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,360
so now with the introduction to genome

221
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,759
now let's talk about what is genomics

222
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
okay genome in short word is a study of

223
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,480
genome

224
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
is mainly

225
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,200
investigating the structure and function

226
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,240
of the genome or whole genome

227
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,720
okay depending on the area of a vocals

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,000
there are structural genomics

229
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,600
functional genomics comparative genomics

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,879
and synthetic genomics and many others

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,120
so genomics is a new and dominating

232
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,120
discipline in genetics it's part of

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
genetics

234
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,799
much has been accomplished in fruit and

235
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,240
vegetable genomics

236
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:01,759
this slide shows about

237
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,879
about 17 fruits and vegetables

238
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,559
which genome has been sequenced

239
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,120
including

240
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,039
apple and grape

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,078
and

242
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,838
oranges and tomato i want to mention

243
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,319
that

244
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
sequencing of the tomato genome is

245
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,200
primarily primarily laid

246
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
by

247
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,079
jim giuliani here at

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
bdi

249
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,078
the development of talents based

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,159
biotechnology

251
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,319
is another

252
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,078
major accomplishment

253
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
in genomics

254
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,679
so talents stand for the world a little

255
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
bit over here

256
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,919
stand for transcription activated like

257
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
effects nucleus

258
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,639
talents based biotechnology is a major

259
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,440
breakthrough

260
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,039
in biotech in biotechnology

261
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,240
that come out

262
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:07,199
from the genomic studies

263
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,839
the major property of tannin

264
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,120
is to make a cut

265
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,399
in the genome

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,399
at a specific location

267
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,879
so

268
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,759
talent is extremely useful

269
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:25,838
and the worst was a hard tool for genome

270
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,838
editing because of that property

271
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:32,399
another the major advantage of

272
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:36,479
talent-based biotechnology is that

273
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,559
talents improved vegetables and fruits

274
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,159
are very comparable

275
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,479
with

276
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,360
those that are developed

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,959
by

278
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
conventional breeding

279
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,359
because there's no foreign mold i'll

280
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,359
come back to all this a little bit later

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,399
too

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,680
so the the bottom drawing shows a talent

283
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
that

284
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,439
cut

285
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,120
a

286
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
target site in the genome

287
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,759
okay so much for the for the

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,879
introduction of genome and genomics so

289
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,039
now let's

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,919
address the second question

291
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,319
why

292
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,479
is genomics a vital solution for

293
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,959
challenges in fruit and vegetable

294
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
production

295
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,600
it's always challenging in

296
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,240
production frozen vegetables

297
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
nowadays so in addition to

298
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,200
the labor the rising labor cost and the

299
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,159
material cost

300
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,440
profitability and pest control

301
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,439
are the major challenges

302
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,000
to

303
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,839
address

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
the profitability challenges

305
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,319
optimizing cropping system and practice

306
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
for high

307
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
yield and quality

308
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,839
are commonly used

309
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,600
to

310
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,360
control the damaging disease and pests

311
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
and insects

312
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
the chemical sprays are used most

313
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
frequently

314
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,959
are there any other means

315
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,839
that are

316
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,319
more

317
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,320
cost effective

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,879
what about

319
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,360
develop developing

320
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,639
superior varieties

321
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
of fruits

322
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,799
or vegetables

323
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,599
that are naturally

324
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,000
of

325
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,959
high yield and quality

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,440
and resistance

327
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,439
to multiple diseases and insects

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,078
from any standard

329
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,839
this is likely the base approach

330
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,198
this is why

331
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,480
genomics

332
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,559
can provide a wider tool wider solution

333
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,759
for the challenges we are facing in

334
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,759
fruit and vegetable production

335
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,639
there are two ways genomes can

336
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,680
provide solutions for developing such

337
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:18,079
superior varieties

338
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:21,198
the first will be using biotechnology

339
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:25,039
so given the controversy controversy

340
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,919
of existing biotechnology

341
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:31,519
the talent specific technology

342
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,719
really holds the promise

343
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,759
i can see

344
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
a lot of

345
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,319
lot along

346
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
a way

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,639
we will go

348
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,639
breathing by design

349
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,039
the second

350
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,120
would be help

351
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,319
conventional breeding

352
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
by

353
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,959
market system breeding or genomic

354
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,959
selection

355
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,559
so i will now show you with examples

356
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,879
first example is

357
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:07,039
improvements of black rod resistance in

358
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,039
brassica around brussels on the racy

359
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,839
black rod is probably the most damaging

360
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,240
disease in christopher's worldwide

361
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,839
and the causal agent

362
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,799
is bacterium

363
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,320
uh the somalis competitors competitors

364
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,120
black rod

365
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,879
is especially damaging to

366
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,399
brassica on a racy

367
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,278
vegetables

368
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,360
such as cabbage

369
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,120
so the photo

370
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,320
on the lower left side

371
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,360
shows

372
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,320
the black road damage to cabbages in the

373
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,159
field and the photo on the lower right

374
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,399
side shows

375
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,480
the lateral damage

376
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,600
inside a cabbage

377
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
i got this photo from

378
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
from

379
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,799
from grief

380
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,800
sound for his help

381
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,440
in addition to cabbage

382
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,399
there are several common vegetables

383
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,040
that are also brassica on the races

384
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,958
including broccoli

385
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,958
and cauliflower

386
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,278
and brussels sprouts

387
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,758
and several others shown here

388
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,240
so all of these particular anorexic

389
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,278
vegetables have problems of

390
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,799
a black

391
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,759
viral

392
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,758
disease problem

393
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,000
so

394
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,439
what makes black rod

395
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,720
a particular problem for brassica owner

396
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
racing

397
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,879
there are at least uh

398
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,480
three factors that are contributing to

399
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:49,759
this this situation the first is the

400
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,399
the source of black road resistance in

401
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,240
brassica on a race is very rare

402
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,799
there are only about two assessions

403
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,360
report of resistance

404
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,519
as shown as shown here

405
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,720
the second

406
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,120
the resistance is very very specific

407
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,600
and rest dependent

408
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,719
the third factor is the resistance can

409
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,159
only be

410
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,240
partially bred into new cultivars

411
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,640
so because of these

412
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,000
limitations breeding for high

413
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,400
resistance

414
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,558
high black road resistance

415
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,559
has made with little success

416
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
to help with

417
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,399
this long struggle for high

418
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,200
level resistance

419
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
two

420
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,840
talents based

421
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,360
uh approach are envisioned

422
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,000
the first is to

423
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,319
identify the resistant genes from

424
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
brassica relatives

425
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,839
and then

426
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,200
transfer them into a blaster on a racing

427
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,279
so the second

428
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,840
is to directly

429
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,119
modify the

430
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:05,119
susceptibility genes

431
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,239
within brassica analysis to convert that

432
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,119
into

433
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
resistant genes

434
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,080
so for the first approach we need we

435
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,480
need to know

436
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,879
what the resistance are there in the

437
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,558
prosecutor relatives

438
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,960
why the resistance in protocol relatives

439
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:30,319
cannot be bred

440
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,120
into brassica on the racing

441
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,960
now here shows strong resistance

442
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,879
existing in several

443
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,880
brassica species including brassica rapa

444
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
brassica brassica

445
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,359
but

446
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,439
the resistance in these relatives

447
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,558
cannot be

448
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,880
easily bred into prosecutor analysis

449
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,798
to explain that let's look at the

450
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,000
relationships

451
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,038
between the brassica species

452
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,240
there are

453
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:09,599
six major brassica species

454
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,599
including three

455
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,559
deployed and three tetraploid

456
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,160
the three

457
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,678
the three deploys

458
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
are

459
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,880
brassica wrapper

460
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,959
of 18

461
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,039
of 10 chromosomes

462
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,919
and prostagland of beijing

463
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,440
of eight chromosomes and brassica

464
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
on the resin

465
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,000
obsidian of nine chromosomes

466
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,519
so there are

467
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,798
three

468
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,759
tetaplus

469
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,960
species are thought to be derived

470
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:48,160
from the natural hybridization

471
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,319
between the diploid species followed by

472
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,558
chromosome doubling

473
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,439
um

474
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,720
the

475
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,759
genome of lava cabbage which is we call

476
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,319
the plaster

477
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,319
lava has been completely sequenced and

478
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:07,319
the pascal on earth on the left

479
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,319
certainly is a topic of this example

480
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,079
now if you make a course

481
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,360
between brussels analysis with any of

482
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:21,038
these species with resistance

483
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:23,439
the hybrid will be not viable not viable

484
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,640
because the imbalance of chromosome

485
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,320
numbers

486
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,960
so this explains

487
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,839
why the resistance in other vascular

488
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,038
species cannot be

489
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,839
moved

490
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,240
into practical analysis by conventional

491
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,240
breeding

492
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,159
therefore

493
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,839
tenants-based

494
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,919
biotechnology is an ideal choice for

495
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,879
moving the brassica

496
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,520
native resistant gene into vascular

497
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
analysis

498
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,119
the

499
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,119
second approach is more exciting because

500
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,639
we don't need to involve any other

501
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,158
personal species

502
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,600
we simply need to identify the

503
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,600
susceptibility genes

504
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
this approach

505
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,519
has been

506
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,558
recently demonstrated successfully in

507
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,839
rice

508
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:24,158
i'll show you in next slides

509
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,480
now the first row

510
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
shows a part of a gene

511
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,679
in a

512
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,119
rice cartival

513
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,960
that is

514
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,038
susceptible to

515
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,360
bacterial blood disease

516
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,720
which is a most described disease in

517
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,918
rice

518
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,679
one of them

519
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
now the rest of the rose basically is

520
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,600
the mutations

521
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,599
that are induced by talents

522
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:55,678
okay those the dash

523
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,519
stand for the dna that were missing that

524
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,640
are deleted by the

525
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,000
by the

526
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,640
talents and the red letters in the red

527
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,919
are the dna bases added

528
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,000
by their

529
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,360
talents

530
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,119
now here's a comparison

531
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:18,959
of the difference in addition name

532
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:22,719
between the non-modified control

533
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,440
and the tenant's modified rise line

534
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,880
so it's clear

535
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,679
that

536
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,480
the susceptibility gene

537
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,840
has been converted into

538
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,839
this resistant genes

539
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:44,319
as i said the

540
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,240
talents modified last line contains

541
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,480
no foreign dna

542
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,839
so these right lines are really

543
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,400
comparable

544
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,038
with conventional bread

545
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,200
any rice varieties

546
00:22:55,038 --> 00:23:02,079
so with talent-based approach

547
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,840
uh high black road resistance in

548
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,720
brussels on a racy

549
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,279
will be available so

550
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,558
so this is so much for the first example

551
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,558
now i'm going to

552
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,720
talk about the second example

553
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:21,119
which is the improvement of fluid

554
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,120
quality based on a flow acidity

555
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,240
i will show you how much assisted

556
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,519
breeding

557
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,640
has been done or can be done to improve

558
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,639
fruit of quality

559
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,919
there's two major reasons to

560
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,000
begin with

561
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,320
apple fruit acidity

562
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,839
the first reason is that

563
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,399
fruit acidity

564
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,439
largely determines fruit taste and

565
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,559
flavor

566
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,519
so fruit acidity is one of the major

567
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,558
components that affect fruits

568
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,639
quality

569
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,599
so other components includes crispr

570
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,159
crispness firmness juiciness size

571
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:06,240
syllable content storability and texture

572
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,080
and the second reason

573
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,319
probably the major reason the apple

574
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,079
breeders led through the city the number

575
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,798
one priority training

576
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,639
for breeding and for genetic studies

577
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,558
i'll come back to this point

578
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,559
why appropriated ready

579
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,359
through the float acidity the number one

580
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,359
priority trade

581
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,278
apple varies

582
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,839
widely in

583
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,079
in the first city

584
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,278
levels based on our own measurement full

585
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,119
ph varies from 2.8

586
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,839
to 4.5

587
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,199
and

588
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,359
to triple acidity the ta

589
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,600
varies from 0.07

590
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,599
to 0.187

591
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
the

592
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,960
accessible range for a desired apple

593
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
variety

594
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,038
is ph

595
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:03,440
3.1 to 3.8

596
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,440
or ta 0.3 to one percent

597
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
above flows

598
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,119
with through the city levels beyond this

599
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
range

600
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,719
are either too high

601
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,839
or too low

602
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,839
in a city

603
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,799
in epigenetics it's known that

604
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:27,199
acidity levels is primarily controlled

605
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,839
by the gene we called ma as i mentioned

606
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,558
earlier

607
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,558
there are two

608
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,679
alleles or versions of this gene

609
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:42,278
and one for high

610
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,278
acid one for low acid

611
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,319
the high acid allele is dominant over

612
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,798
the lowest value

613
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,038
so there are three possible genotypes in

614
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,038
apple

615
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,840
homey likes high acid genotype

616
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,798
and heterolytic high acid genotype

617
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,319
and

618
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:07,440
home like homologous low acid genotype

619
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,759
because apple receives one allele

620
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,320
from the seed parent another layer from

621
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,319
the pollen

622
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,120
in a survey

623
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,960
79 percent of the name level varieties

624
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,479
are

625
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,880
heterozygous genotype

626
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,360
and fourteen percent homologous highest

627
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,600
unit of and seven percent homozygous

628
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,839
lowest units

629
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,079
so this is high as two high acetylene

630
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,399
type supposed to produce fruits over

631
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,720
high acid and the low acetylene type

632
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
produces lowest difference

633
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,679
when an apple has a low acid in your

634
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,038
type the fruit tastes very flat

635
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,519
no flavor

636
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,919
so in breeding programs those seasonings

637
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:54,158
will be useless no commercial value near

638
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,159
the certain way as quickly as possible

639
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,440
since

640
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,679
the high

641
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,880
the heterozygote high acetylene type is

642
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
dominant

643
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,679
in the named above varieties

644
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
the most brilliant population is derived

645
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,000
from two

646
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,918
genotypes that are both

647
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,759
heterozygous high acid

648
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,919
as shown here

649
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,119
so the protein is of this kind of

650
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,399
crosses

651
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,678
segregates like one quarter of the union

652
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,918
of low acid genotype

653
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,399
so although this

654
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,720
breeder knows that okay growing in this

655
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,199
genus has useless is wasting time money

656
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,399
but they cannot

657
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,798
throw them away with confidence

658
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,798
that's why the rate for the city is

659
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,398
number one priority trade

660
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,960
if someone can help them doing this one

661
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:52,000
they'll be great so

662
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,159
that's why we wanted to

663
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,159
identify the fruit of staging

664
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,519
so through extensive efforts we were

665
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,200
able to

666
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,798
reveal the identity of genome genema

667
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
as i mentioned

668
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,319
earlier

669
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,360
the imagine

670
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,158
has

671
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,558
1707

672
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,559
dna bases

673
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,439
and encoding a magic acid transport

674
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,599
protein

675
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,600
of 568 amino acids

676
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,038
the arrow

677
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,038
stands for the radiant direction of the

678
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,278
gene okay

679
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,839
the upper two rows

680
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:39,679
shows the dna bases

681
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,678
and their corresponding positions

682
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,159
with

683
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:48,000
orbs with omission of the majority okay

684
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,760
now the lower two rows shows the

685
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,960
corresponding

686
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:56,079
amino acid residues and the

687
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,079
corresponding position

688
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,240
we found that a single living

689
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,879
a single base mutation

690
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,519
from

691
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,919
g1455

692
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,558
to

693
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,159
a1455

694
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:14,558
in the gene ma is responsible for low

695
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,559
acid fruit

696
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,678
as i mentioned earlier

697
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,319
the reason is that the mutation

698
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,919
caused a premature

699
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,359
stop button

700
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,200
in the imaging

701
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,959
as shown here

702
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,679
this is a mutation then they call this

703
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,960
stop button here so then they cut off

704
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,960
the rest of the

705
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,759
amino acids which is 84 of them

706
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,840
so presumably these

707
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,839
cause the imagine malfunction

708
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,919
so with the finding of this gene we want

709
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,319
to use it in our brain

710
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,399
now we developed a marker called caps

711
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,278
1455

712
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,239
to

713
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,798
specifically type in the mutation site

714
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,880
and the location

715
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,960
now this gel shows

716
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,000
a a

717
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,679
example of analysis of the marker caps

718
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,398
1455

719
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,960
in a diverse set of apple varieties and

720
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,959
selections

721
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:23,839
each of the lanes

722
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,599
stand for apple variety or a selection

723
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,918
the top ends

724
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,240
stand for high acid allele

725
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,559
the lower band stands for low acid

726
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,558
allele

727
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,199
the single tall bands

728
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,798
in this lens

729
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,080
are for homozygous high acid in red

730
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,359
and the single lower bands

731
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:52,158
in the lens

732
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,158
stand for homozygous low acid genotype

733
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,599
and those with two bands

734
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,839
are stand a stand for heterolites

735
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,639
high acid genotype

736
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:07,439
so

737
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:10,320
those in red and in yellow are expected

738
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,360
to produce fruit of high acid and those

739
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,439
in white are expected to produce fruit

740
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,959
of low acid

741
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,558
here is a ph data for those varieties

742
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,038
and selections

743
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:27,359
this is is exactly what we expected

744
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,679
for example

745
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,959
in the three wire lanes

746
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:37,120
which is a homologous lowest genotype

747
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,960
the ph measured from 4.3 to 4.5

748
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,918
very high ph

749
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,919
just in low acid

750
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,079
so this indicating that

751
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:50,079
markov caps protein

752
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:54,000
the caps 1455 is a versatile marker

753
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,000
for marker associated breeding

754
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,278
how to apply this marker in above

755
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
reading

756
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,000
so the first will be

757
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,759
marker marker

758
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
sydney marcus is the selection of

759
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,359
signings

760
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,480
so in collaborative collaboration with

761
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,479
our breeder dr susan brown

762
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,880
we test this marker

763
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,839
in her in one of her large above

764
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,880
breeding population

765
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,678
again

766
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,840
each lane stands for siemens so this

767
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
gear picture was just showing part of

768
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,480
the results

769
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,440
now the

770
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,000
the lane the lane with a single bat

771
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,278
that indicated with a

772
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,519
red arrow

773
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:37,278
are for homologous high acid genotype

774
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,839
and

775
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:43,278
those with the two bands

776
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,240
indicated with a yellow arrow

777
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,839
are

778
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,519
heterozygous high acid genotype

779
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,398
and those

780
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,759
with a single lower band

781
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,719
are homozygous lower the tenderness

782
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,679
so

783
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,640
just based on we have 96

784
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,960
unions shown here so we have about 23

785
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,679
percent with low estimate

786
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,840
it's very close to 25

787
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
as we

788
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,119
expected

789
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,439
so those feelings

790
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:20,079
seriously can be thrown away

791
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,080
i have suggested also but she hasn't

792
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:24,639
so the

793
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,398
second

794
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,320
approach

795
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,000
the second application is the market

796
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,359
system

797
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,640
planning for new crosses

798
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:40,639
now the idea is to maximize

799
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,519
the heterozygous high acid genotype in

800
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,038
the protein while minimize

801
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,000
the

802
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,759
portion of law of homolytic low estrogen

803
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,960
attack

804
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,558
so

805
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,679
the basic cross

806
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,639
will be made between a homolog lowest

807
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,600
genotype and a

808
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,559
homologous high-efficiency

809
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,199
location here with dark green

810
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,199
because proteins of this crosses a

811
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,159
hundred percent

812
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,158
heterogeneous highest genetic

813
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,079
so the cross is between

814
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,039
two

815
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,839
heterozygous highest genotype or between

816
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,000
a heterozygous hydrogen up with a

817
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,239
homologous hydrogen but also

818
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,679
acceptable

819
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,838
and the cross is made between a

820
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,878
homologue laws genotype with

821
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,358
a uh

822
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,559
headed like a high achieving that can be

823
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,598
done

824
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,320
but

825
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,599
half of that fifty percent of the scenes

826
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,280
will be

827
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,760
segregated for low estrogen type

828
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,639
so closest to a void are those between

829
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,159
two

830
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,039
homologue low estrogen type and two homo

831
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,039
high acid nutrients

832
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:06,078
okay in summary so genome is the total

833
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,639
collection of dna or genes in

834
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,280
reproductive cells

835
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,799
the genome genomics is a study of the

836
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,800
structural function of the whole genome

837
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,639
our talent represents one of the major

838
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,159
breakthroughs in genome editing

839
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,838
and in

840
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,480
precise and clean genetic engineering

841
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,480
and genomics provides vital solutions

842
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,400
for challenges that cannot be

843
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,119
effectively addressed

844
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,680
through conventional breeding

845
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,559
genomics helps increase breeding

846
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:44,319
efficiency especially in tree fruits

847
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,599
of a long juvenile phase

848
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,119
i want to thank

849
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,000
dr suleiman

850
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,559
leonard chen and general father for

851
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,880
their help in uh

852
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,880
florida city project i also would like

853
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,920
to thank debbie

854
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,880
and laurie for help in my extension

855
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
program

856
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,000
yambae is my grad student and laura is a

857
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,000
technician in the lab

858
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,320
so i would like to stop here

859
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,719
thank you for our attention and ready

860
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,720
for any questions

861
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,720
this is a very nice question uh

862
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,960
that's the question i ask myself all the

863
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,959
time

864
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,079
um

865
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,400
actually i didn't show uh here

866
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,359
when we uh

867
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,039
try to identify the gnma

868
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,480
we

869
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,480
genotyped many

870
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,920
many

871
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,599
apple signalings

872
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,280
in the population

873
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,599
so if you look at

874
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,920
their uh distribution

875
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,880
it's clearly the two peaks

876
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,000
that's the breaking points around 3.8 in

877
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,720
ph

878
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,400
and the ta is around

879
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,679
0.3

880
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
so so that's why we put one category as

881
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,399
a low

882
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,800
acid

883
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,920
another category with a high acid

884
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,240
now

885
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,119
you're absolutely right so there's a

886
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:25,039
continuous variation within either of

887
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,599
the categories

888
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,400
so i think this

889
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,800
is the next phase of our goal to find

890
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
out what exactly what exactly causing

891
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,119
that

892
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,280
but the imagine the major function of

893
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,720
the imaging is to

894
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,519
make that curve

895
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,919
okay for the higher s group and for low

896
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:49,119
ethical now to find tony need

897
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,639
certainness there's other facts involved

898
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,680
that's true that's

899
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,239
that's the things we are pursuing

900
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,719
very vigorously when i have that i'll

901
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,719
let you know

902
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,519
yes uh

903
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,960
well i

904
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,559
i don't mean

905
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,760
to discount

906
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,159
the rules of copying system and

907
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,240
and the orchard or the field management

908
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:21,279
no this is not my point

909
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:23,679
uh i i realize these very important uh

910
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,040
efforts need to be done need to be in

911
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,319
place to

912
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,119
uh manage

913
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,800
uh the field or the orchard

914
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,920
now the point that i try to make is

915
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,519
if we have a resistant variety that will

916
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,760
be really helpful

917
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:43,639
and that's not all certainly not all i

918
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,640
agree with that thank you

919
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,598
i think this will be helpful i i don't

920
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,440
know how what

921
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,960
what really the process will be in the

922
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
regulation

923
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,838
but i would say that

924
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,879
based on the fact

925
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:04,480
okay um

926
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,640
there's no foreign dna being involved

927
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,559
in those talents

928
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,358
modified lines

929
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,880
this should not be regulated at all

930
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,960
this is my view

931
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,519
but people certainly can argue the

932
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,079
process that you used is similar to

933
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,559
those that we use for conventional

934
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,480
biotechnology

935
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,279
but the fact is

936
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,199
we don't have anything left

937
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,440
we must display this i think it should

938
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,199
be easier okay i don't know actually

939
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,000
that's you should maybe i should say

940
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,719
first

941
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,880
then i my guess it should be easier

942
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,759
then your second question

943
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,800
um

944
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,400
can you remind me

945
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,079
acceptance

946
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,639
i think

947
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,039
that's probably very similar to uh

948
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,679
to the first situation we just need to

949
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,440
get a fact out this is really different

950
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,759
really different from the first

951
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,039
generation technology the television is

952
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,480
different

953
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,480
because there's nothing that really

954
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,838
knows nothing being involved in the

955
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,519
whole you know so why you want

956
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,759
ridiculous if less than ten dollars to

957
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,838
be resistant or tend to be higher or

958
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,640
higher quality

959
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:11,679
but

960
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,639
again

961
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,598
so we can ever

962
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,440
know

963
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,440
what public really reacted to that

964
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,440
technology

965
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,760
well that's that

966
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,318
to be honest here that's something uh

967
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,960
unexpected i i don't

968
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,358
expect uh

969
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,480
that kind of message will be conveyed

970
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:40,318
through last night i just want to make a

971
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,760
point that

972
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:46,000
it is a genome that make who we are

973
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,240
uh what the gorilla is

974
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,318
why gorilla is a gorilla

975
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:55,279
i i i i see a point okay i

976
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:59,679
our pet into that try avoid

977
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,680
necessarily left in that store okay

978
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,358
thank you for

979
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,679
the commentary i you know i have a slide

980
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,639
prepared for this

981
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,799
for this seminar then i'll take it out

982
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:17,039
um it's something

983
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,400
called the central dogma

984
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,400
dna makes rna makes protein

985
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,960
no eventually i'd like to take that

986
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,960
thing out

987
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,280
so i may consider to put back in

988
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,279
thank you

989
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,720
well the collection is this

990
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,720
um

991
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,000
so when you

992
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,639
start in course try to develop a new

993
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,199
apple varieties

994
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,159
you basically don't want

995
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,799
those

996
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,078
low seasonings in your breeding

997
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,599
population

998
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,599
so you want to

999
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,119
get rid of those

1000
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,838
as early as possible to save some space

1001
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,480
in the orchard so suddenly they'll be

1002
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,880
reducing some of the

1003
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,039
cost hopefully increase the breeding

1004
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,440
efficiency because you can plan more

1005
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,279
useful things in a limited area with

1006
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,559
limited resources

1007
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,800
so that's the point i

1008
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,639
i i do not think

1009
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,400
the eighty percent of poverty is now

1010
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,598
have a high acid

1011
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,760
now we

1012
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,240
these are already developed

1013
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,400
so what i'll talk about is for

1014
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:38,799
getting the better varieties to get

1015
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
sooner and quicker and better

1016
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:42,920
thank you larry

1017
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,318
um

1018
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,720
my experience with master gardeners

1019
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,079
are very positive

1020
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,959
so

1021
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,920
looks like they are very

1022
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,240
more more

1023
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,358
they are very receptive

1024
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,239
to

1025
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,000
this kind of new information

1026
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,959
suddenly my experience is also limited

1027
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,039
okay

1028
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,559
uh just based on what i uh the feedback

1029
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,838
was the feedback that

1030
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,599
that i get

1031
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:17,199
now the experience with apple industries

1032
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,000
a little bit different

1033
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,439
so let me just show you uh let me just

1034
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,760
tell you uh

1035
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,838
one of the feedback that i get for the

1036
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,319
two

1037
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:30,239
uh basically for the two seminars that i

1038
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,599
the two lectures that are given you know

1039
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,879
winterfell schools for apple growers

1040
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,599
um

1041
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,880
so there are the scores like when

1042
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,200
is the

1043
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,480
worst four

1044
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,598
is the best okay so basically four is

1045
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,519
excellent

1046
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,720
three

1047
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:53,119
is good

1048
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:56,879
and two is is fair and one is poor

1049
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,318
so for the topic itself i got score 2.5

1050
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,920
that's the audience

1051
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,480
that's about the 400 audience the

1052
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,400
feedback is probably more than 100.

1053
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,559
so that's you well you know

1054
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,559
well

1055
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,039
okay the master gardener in the

1056
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,199
gardening public do not

1057
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:17,199
seem to be against

1058
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:19,759
the idea of transgenic

1059
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,039
apples or transgenic cabbages or

1060
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,040
anything like that

1061
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,519
i

1062
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,519
i do not do not sense that do nothing

1063
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,119
because when i give a talk i didn't i

1064
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,358
didn't say

1065
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,358
uh

1066
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:38,480
the transgenics will be uh

1067
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,000
will be used uh immediately suddenly we

1068
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,280
need to go through the process i just

1069
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
try to explain

1070
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,000
the fact that neutral news technology

1071
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,400
are there things that were getting

1072
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,239
cleaner so it's more hopefully it'll be

1073
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,680
more acceptable

1074
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,679
to the to to them

1075
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:59,838
no

1076
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,679
it's uh

1077
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,400
the

1078
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,159
we look at their assets about

1079
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,480
3.7

1080
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,239
still within high acid range

1081
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,159
in ph the

1082
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,838
the ta is like

1083
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,838
uh

1084
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,159
t like like a 4

1085
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:19,599
so uh

1086
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,318
it's still we

1087
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
within the bigger category of hyacinth

1088
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,279
the

1089
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,598
we also have the uh

1090
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,640
the genotype

1091
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,119
data using the market we developed fuji

1092
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,879
is clearly the heterozygous

1093
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,160
and the lucas

1094
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,760
as a as an apple grower

1095
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,519
i think we're living in one of the parts

1096
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,440
of the world where people have

1097
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,960
the greatest preference for tartar

1098
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,679
varieties for

1099
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,519
high acid or medium acid apples

1100
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,838
and my sense is in most other parts of

1101
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,239
the world except maybe western europe

1102
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,239
people really prefer the lower acid end

1103
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,479
of the range i guess my question is

1104
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,399
what's the cut off you know what

1105
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,838
we know that an apple when the furnace

1106
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,160
gets below

1107
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,480
seven pounds or something it won't taste

1108
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,879
nearly but what's the cut off for the

1109
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,599
city for example golden delicious

1110
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,880
probably the most popular apple variety

1111
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,280
in europe

1112
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,640
now if you look at for ph and t at the

1113
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:22,720
harvest it's way above the the border

1114
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:27,598
that i said i said this ph 3.8 and the

1115
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:31,118
ta 3.0 or 0.3.3 percent is way above the

1116
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,720
range so way into the highest range what

1117
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,119
i'm talking about the highest is not

1118
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,358
really you can't even test it's

1119
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,400
basically there's a relative term to

1120
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:39,598
those

1121
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,160
double

1122
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,400
basically homologous law at the time

1123
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:44,399
okay

1124
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,119
let's all thank our speaker

1125
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,598
thank you

1126
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:04,440
this has been a production of cornell

1127
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,439
