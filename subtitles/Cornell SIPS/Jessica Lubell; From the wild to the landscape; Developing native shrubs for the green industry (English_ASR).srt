1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,539
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:14,789
University thank you okay all right

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,528
thank you for having me I'm excited to

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:21,899
be here today to talk about native

5
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:24,630
plants this cover photo kind of shows

6
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,989
the three prongs of my work which is

7
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,518
looking at landscape adaptability

8
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:32,250
propagation and production in containers

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,019
or I don't want to say new native plants

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,299
because they're not new to the planet

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,180
but new to the horticultural industry so

12
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:43,199
so to say novel novel native native

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:47,189
shrubs mostly and the reason why I

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,670
started or I guess my work with natives

15
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:53,670
started with my dissertation work on

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,100
invasives so for my my doctoral work I

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,960
looked at the contributions of cultivars

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,840
of Japanese Barbary and winged euonymus

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,808
to invasive populations because at the

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,510
time the state of Connecticut was facing

21
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:09,629
bans they were enacting a voluntary ban

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,820
on Japanese Barbary cultivars with high

23
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,069
fruiting and they were looking for safe

24
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:18,899
alternatives particularly native plant

25
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:20,849
alternatives and kind of did wanted to

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,250
get away from Barbary I was tired of the

27
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,769
thorns and the scratched arms and

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,530
fingers and the thorns will last for

29
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,179
months under your skin and I may still

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,879
have some coming up and there's a long

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,790
time ago and but the question was you

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:39,170
know can can natives fill the gap left

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,210
by Japanese Barbary cultivars that are

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,210
incredibly tough and can grow in

35
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,669
parking-lot islands and highlight high

36
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,309
heat high pedestrian pressure salt

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,740
runoff they can propagate and grow in

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,460
containers very easily so can you have

39
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:59,239
native shrubs that can do the same thing

40
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:02,578
one of the first plants that I looked at

41
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:05,728
was nine bark because it was a direct

42
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:09,469
replacement for Barbary purple foliage

43
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:12,330
cultivars yellow foliage cultivars

44
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:13,680
probably today they're on one of the

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,719
fewer only

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,700
recked replacements for purple Barbary

47
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:20,459
is still this plant I could think of

48
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,139
there's some purple red and orange

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,628
leaves dear villas now but they're

50
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,779
really more southern natives and we

51
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,518
looked at powdery mildew susceptibility

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,370
and the cultivars that were available at

53
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,039
the time and we had yellow foliage

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,718
cultivars and purple foliage cultivars

55
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:41,848
and we found that the older cultivar

56
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:44,579
nÃ¦ss with smaller leaves was largely

57
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:46,649
resistant to powdery mildew and this

58
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:50,159
paper actually is probably one of my

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,930
most cited papers we very useful to not

60
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,449
only plant breeders and scientists but

61
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,939
also no nursery growers and landscapers

62
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,158
and from this work a lot of breeding was

63
00:02:56,938 --> 00:03:01,408
done to develop new cultivars this is

64
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,628
some of the new cultivars since that

65
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:06,780
study and a lot of them have made this

66
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:09,500
as a parent so using that resistance to

67
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,449
breed in or better landscape plants I

68
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,609
think this is the cultivar Donna Mae at

69
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,468
the coastal Maine Botanical Gardens

70
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,150
which features a lot of native plants if

71
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:22,108
you're into native plants it's worth a

72
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,389
visit up there so wrapping up the nine

73
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:27,810
bark work I started to think about other

74
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:30,120
native plants and there were a good

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,519
number that were widely used very

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,669
important landscape plants like winter

77
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,430
berry Holly and the creeping juniper by

78
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,609
Burnham den Tatum red twig dogwood that

79
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,459
were popular important native plants but

80
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:47,519
overall it seemed like native plants

81
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,709
were being overlooked for landscape

82
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,438
potential and this is a trade show

83
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,598
display showing the proven winners here

84
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:57,810
on your left and American beauties

85
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,518
native plants brand on the right and you

86
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,188
know if you were a consumer which

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,009
display would you choose from and it's

88
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:06,478
really not the native plants fault it's

89
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:08,219
just we don't know didn't know how to

90
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,620
grow them in containers they're smaller

91
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:14,639
pots you know how to force them for

92
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,829
display propagation was difficult mostly

93
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,930
done by seed which doesn't yield uniform

94
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,860
crops so it seemed like there was a lot

95
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,028
of potential to develop new natives or

96
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,569
additional natives that could be

97
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:26,569
adaptable

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,920
so one of the first things that we did

99
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,439
is we put native shrubs that were not

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,439
commonly available or widely used in a

101
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,529
tough landscape site on the Yukon campus

102
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,569
and parking lot islands alongside

103
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:47,539
barbarian euonymus here's here they are

104
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:50,629
and so this was just one site and we had

105
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,020
this replicated and we did the first

106
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:57,199
round in 2010 with those six natives up

107
00:04:54,019 --> 00:05:00,649
there we did another round in 2012 to

108
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:04,310
2014 with another eight native plants

109
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:07,489
and crimson pygmy Barbary and compact

110
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,079
this euonymus as controls and when we

111
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,030
first put this study in I thought

112
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,649
everything was going to die after the

113
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:14,719
first winter and there'd barbarian

114
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:16,789
euonymus would be standing just really

115
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,220
pleasantly surprised that most

116
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,010
everything survived and performed well

117
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,190
and so we measured aesthetic quality and

118
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,769
survival and things like that this was a

119
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,660
really a tough side when you dug it up

120
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:32,409
it was largely backfill from the

121
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,360
construction of these dorms it was hot

122
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,939
highlight there's a huge commuter

123
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,040
parking lot there called W lot in this

124
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,219
site we used another parking lot for

125
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:49,610
round two part of another parking lot so

126
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:53,660
not much to support the plants so this

127
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:57,080
is the aesthetic quality index results

128
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,360
for that first study and you can see the

129
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:02,229
crimson pygmy barbarian euonymus here

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,840
and this was aesthetic quality in 2010

131
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,819
2011 and 2012 and there were you know

132
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,339
several plants like the sweet fern and

133
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:12,769
the sweet gal that right out of the gate

134
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:15,169
performed as well as the invasives and

135
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,750
they several of them that kind of lagged

136
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,600
behind were just as good as the

137
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,240
Barbarian euonymus by the third year and

138
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,860
so that was you know make a good

139
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,990
recommendation that these would can

140
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,319
certainly be alternatives for barbarian

141
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,180
euonymus in tough sites so I want to

142
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,339
talk about some of these plants because

143
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,050
with some of these plants I took the

144
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:38,239
research a step further and looked at

145
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,470
propagation and production in containers

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,300
median fertility and shading in that

147
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,700
kind of thing so I'm gonna talk about a

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,439
few of these then I'll show you the

149
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,939
results of the second parking lot and

150
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,199
talk about some of those and that's kind

151
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:55,050
of how it's gonna flow okay okay

152
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,149
so come Tonio peregrina I don't know if

153
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,970
I saw some of these natives on campus I

154
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:04,789
don't know if I saw this one but I

155
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,870
believe it's here the sweet fern is a

156
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,780
really interesting plant

157
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,990
it's a pioneer plant it fixes nitrogen

158
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:16,589
in the soil through these root nodules

159
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,900
and Frankia bacteria that fixes nitrogen

160
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:21,629
so it comes in after a forest fire or

161
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,879
after a clearing and it rejuvenates the

162
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:27,300
soil for other plants to then come in so

163
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,730
it's very adaptable to dry gravelly

164
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,210
nutrient deficient soils like you see in

165
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:36,930
a parking lot island or a commercial

166
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:39,449
landscape site so these are the plants

167
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,310
in the parking lot this was at the bus

168
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,560
stop location there it is right next to

169
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,339
the wings euonymus so it's a nice dense

170
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,139
plant when full Sun and some people say

171
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,109
that it's not that long-lived but this

172
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,719
is going into its sixth season it gets

173
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,569
to that you know three to four foot

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,340
height nice and compact dense it has a

175
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,740
wonderful fragrance to the foliage

176
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,659
especially on a warm sunny day so you

177
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,629
can smell like Cinnabon in the parking

178
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,860
lot but you wouldn't expect but a really

179
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:13,139
interesting plant here it is kind of

180
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,300
being used as a hedgerow at coastal

181
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,639
Maine botanical gardens or a shrub e

182
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,270
ground cover under trees this was a neat

183
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:27,629
parking lot at a Lowe's in Maine or kind

184
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:30,029
of as naturalizing I think that the

185
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,918
sweet fern is a real sweetheart plant

186
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:34,259
for a lot of people but the problem with

187
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,629
it has been propagation it's difficult

188
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:40,500
to propagate so it doesn't produce a lot

189
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:43,889
of seeds the seeds need smoke or fire to

190
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,740
break their dormancy and if you can't

191
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:49,139
take readily take stem cuttings softwood

192
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,839
stem cuttings and the traditional sense

193
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,819
so it's largely propagated by digging up

194
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,770
sods divide

195
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,660
the rhizomes so one of the first studies

196
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:01,559
that I did as an assistant professor

197
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:06,360
leaving barbary behind was look at media

198
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:10,439
or doing rhizome divisions and we used

199
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,450
vermiculite and Safford mix and sand and

200
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,010
it was it was very easy to propagate

201
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,890
from divisions you could take small

202
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,049
two-inch segments and and get plants

203
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,490
these are actually the plants that I

204
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,219
raised up and put in the parking lot

205
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,500
I'll endure a couple of years later and

206
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm still working with this plant I had

207
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,309
an undergrad last year do some stem

208
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,379
cuttings from very young shoots so when

209
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,079
they get to be no more than three inches

210
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,820
tall coming up from the rhizome and more

211
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,230
recently shown that it'll work from

212
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:48,180
shoots as well but very young stems

213
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:51,240
roots readily with an IBA oxen and they

214
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,429
can make nice dense plants and you can

215
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,919
even get reefs well after you take

216
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:58,469
cuttings from the rhizomes and this is

217
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,829
the data from that work which is not yet

218
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,840
published and just showing that we use

219
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,940
two different propagation systems we

220
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,500
used an intermittent mist just straight

221
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,760
putting it in the mist with a little bit

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,990
of a with them covering over it for

223
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,740
shade it was just kind of like an upside

224
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,230
down flat and we used a propagation dome

225
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,990
a clear dome and the mist worked a lot

226
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,230
better I mean 98% rooting for canto Nia

227
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:28,350
is wonderful the dome didn't do too bad

228
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,889
about 70 percent rooting what happened

229
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:34,950
with the dome was the tips would dry out

230
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:37,500
a little bit it wasn't as as humid in

231
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,810
there and that actually promoted lateral

232
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,090
branching so we got slightly larger

233
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,349
plants with the dome but better rooting

234
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,170
with the mist so you could perhaps

235
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,200
recommend rooting and mist and pinching

236
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:50,909
to get greater branching and then we

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,250
grew the mountain containers and three

238
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:56,279
thousand one thousand to three thousand

239
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:01,070
IBA maybe a little bit higher you can

240
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,069
get you know 80% or more rooting and

241
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:06,720
sound of developing native ARS I'll talk

242
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,038
a little bit more about that towards the

243
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,629
end

244
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:14,759
we have raised this interesting clone of

245
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:18,178
canto Nia that has a bluish cast to the

246
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:21,989
foliage a kind of a very uniform margin

247
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:23,759
to the leaf and nice kind of branching

248
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,619
and symmetry to the plan and the

249
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,649
University of Connecticut is looking to

250
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:33,658
patent this now to you know to get into

251
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:36,239
production see about that another plant

252
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:38,519
that is also has scented foliage is

253
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:40,349
America pencil nope that's wrong it

254
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,328
should be miracle Gail sorry that's

255
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:44,789
incorrect

256
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:45,538
sweet Gail is merica Gail it's still

257
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,328
merica

258
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:51,778
so the bayberry is now Marella but this

259
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:54,719
is America Gail and normally you'd find

260
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:58,408
it in around the edge margins of lakes

261
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,168
streams freshwater mostly it has this

262
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:03,928
kind of frosty lime green foliage it's

263
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:08,208
not it's deciduous so it's it's a cousin

264
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:12,088
of the bay berry it doesn't have the the

265
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:16,438
berries with the candle wax on them

266
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,149
they're a more of a catkin but here it

267
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:20,338
is growing in the parking lot Islands

268
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,519
here's crimson pygmy Barbary it's a very

269
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,369
low plan one to two feet it has this

270
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,889
kind of arching candelabra like habit to

271
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:32,579
it the stems are kind of a brown purpley

272
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:36,538
brown with yellow white yellow lenticels

273
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:38,908
on it scented foliage it's tends to be

274
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:41,278
Manisha sword Ayesha sand there are male

275
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:43,438
and female plants the clone we had in

276
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,499
the parking lot was a male and the male

277
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:52,038
catkins can be really showy in early

278
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:55,229
spring very early spring here this is

279
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:57,298
some that we put near my house I think

280
00:12:55,229 --> 00:13:02,158
and this is two years later so you can

281
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:03,928
get a nice hedgerow low in the parking

282
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:07,859
lots I've seen you know bird's nest in

283
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:11,698
it this is actually in Rockland Maine

284
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:13,739
near marina so you can see trying to be

285
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:16,469
used here at landscape architects have a

286
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:17,459
good novel idea there it's a really cold

287
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,790
hardy plant

288
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:26,250
I think it's found all the way up maybe

289
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:28,529
into Alaska the growers says that it's

290
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,570
very easy to propagate so I didn't do a

291
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:32,339
lot of studies with this I just tried it

292
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,010
with you know Hormann in one it routes

293
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,780
very well it grows very fast you could

294
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,629
probably go right from a cutting into a

295
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:42,419
number one in one year you can prune it

296
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,220
share it and it's very dense so it's a

297
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,709
said that's what you know growers like

298
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,259
something that's fast to grow takes a

299
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:54,420
typical bark piece and media and control

300
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:57,330
release fertilizer so northern Bush

301
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,849
honeysuckle deer Villalon asura this is

302
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,129
I saw this on campus I saw the southern

303
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,430
incest Allah so Leah and and this one as

304
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:09,000
well this was in the parking lot Islands

305
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:10,620
uh not as popular among nursery growers

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,169
but it should be because it's very

307
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,590
adaptable it stays really low it's a

308
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:18,329
terrific B plant so this is me this was

309
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,730
one near my driveway you can just sit

310
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,430
and watch the bumblebees all day has

311
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,430
these um clusters of tubular yellow

312
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:29,699
flowers at the tips of the shoots

313
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:31,620
reddish foliage on the new growth this

314
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,930
was in the parking lot so the first year

315
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,929
they didn't look as good because they

316
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:38,939
came this is in 2010 they came from the

317
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:41,159
nursery and they hadn't been spaced in a

318
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,410
timely manner at the nursery so as soon

319
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,639
as we spread them out the shoots fell

320
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:49,769
over so we've got a poor visible rating

321
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,139
but they this basically they just

322
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,029
resprayed from the base and that's one

323
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,610
thing you can do with this plant you can

324
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,289
prune it back readily and have it you

325
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,860
know Reese proud and make a dense plant

326
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:04,049
and this was you know year three I think

327
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,310
we had the coat of our copper which

328
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:09,809
tends to get really red new growth

329
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:12,299
there's copper right there at the

330
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:14,729
coastal Maine Botanical Gardens this was

331
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:17,490
an outside of a daycare center in stores

332
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,220
downtown stores Connecticut and this is

333
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,139
on the UConn campus and this is at

334
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,970
coastal Maine and this is that planting

335
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,879
I was looking at the bees act we can get

336
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,710
a nice fall color and I saw a huge

337
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,350
planting that I'm bigger than I've ever

338
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,790
seen on campus here I don't know what

339
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,620
building it was at but it was a big

340
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:36,929
swath of it I took a picture

341
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,659
this is out a parking lot out in the

342
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:43,109
Minnesota they're using it a lot out

343
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:45,360
there the button Bush is another one

344
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,830
that when people saw this in the parking

345
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,750
lots they were shocked that it would

346
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,090
grow because typically it's a plant that

347
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,470
you find on the edge of water with its

348
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:57,389
roots submerged in the water but

349
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,720
sometimes native plants are adaptable to

350
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,330
a niche outside of where you find them

351
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,490
but in those areas they maybe don't

352
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,470
compete but and they'll do fine in these

353
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,240
tougher areas and so that's where you

354
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,670
see them but it doesn't necessarily mean

355
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,440
that they can't be used in a landscape

356
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,299
in a different way and that's the case

357
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,540
with button Bush because here it is in

358
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:22,709
the bus stop parking lot island doing

359
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:25,110
quite well in a quick draining not too

360
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,910
wet but maybe it offers a little bit of

361
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,000
moisture soil this is kind of the

362
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:33,509
typical use in a rain garden but it can

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,639
it can do well in drier sites maybe not

364
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,639
completely dry but it can do quite well

365
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,179
outside of its niche

366
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,460
it's very desirable for it's interesting

367
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:46,559
inflorescences these golf ball-sized

368
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:50,009
white flower clusters that attract lots

369
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,839
of pollinators and and these fruits kind

370
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,309
of persist they turn a reddish and then

371
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,070
a black and they'll persist into the

372
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:58,589
winter they're very easy to propagate

373
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,480
from seed they don't need any cold

374
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,639
stratification or anything like that

375
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,460
but there's a lot of diversity from seed

376
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,619
and not so desirable diversity sometimes

377
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,319
you know different leaves different

378
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,689
habits so if you were a designer this

379
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,819
may not be so desirable for you and

380
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,440
there are some cultivars of this which

381
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,359
is what's really important for this

382
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,620
plant to make it in the nursery trade to

383
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,899
have a little bit more symmetry and

384
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:28,379
stability or predictability so there's

385
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,750
Sputnik which is an older cultivar sugar

386
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,760
shack which is a really good cultivar a

387
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,190
little bit more compact three to four

388
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:39,740
feet here are some new ones that are not

389
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,740
as as well tested as sugar chef

390
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:46,220
this is the American filbert and this is

391
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,798
mark right here and in the parking lot

392
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,600
Islands this is a wild plant this is

393
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:55,009
just showing the size because he's about

394
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:57,618
six foot so it's big it gets a nice fall

395
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:59,690
color there's two native filbert's

396
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:02,599
there's the American filbert and there's

397
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,970
the beaked filbert which is coral ascore

398
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,738
nuda it's the coral ascore nuta is the

399
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,509
plant that I wanted for the parking-lot

400
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:10,460
Islands because I thought it had a more

401
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:13,489
finer texture a little bit more

402
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,259
ornamentally pleasing but this is

403
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,028
they're very difficult to distinguish

404
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,979
and this is what I got from the nursery

405
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:21,739
American filbert which we realized about

406
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:23,690
a year later but it did very well it had

407
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:26,058
this really there's the burning bush

408
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,149
right there next to it this nice kind of

409
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:33,009
mix of fall foliage color the American

410
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:36,108
filbert has this ruffled involucre and

411
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:39,649
we did find from raising some seed of

412
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:42,138
this a compact form called a little

413
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:44,268
filly so I'm still working on

414
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:46,819
propagation of this it's not easy the

415
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:48,589
filbert's are not so easy but we did do

416
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:53,089
a study with the beaked filbert that's

417
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:54,978
coming up the beaked filbert is the

418
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:57,439
easiest way to distinguish it from the

419
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:59,629
American filbert is by the involute Urso

420
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,690
it's shaped more like a duck beak versus

421
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:05,569
kind of the ruffled shirt sleeve this is

422
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:08,929
it at the Minnesota botanic garden or

423
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:14,028
Arboretum and this one tends to be a

424
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:15,679
little bit more in the colder areas with

425
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,229
then the American but they they

426
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,599
certainly overlap and there's other ways

427
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:22,548
you can tell the American filbert apart

428
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:24,589
from the beach filbert the fall color

429
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:27,048
the the beaked gets more of a yellow I

430
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:29,569
know it's these are wild shoots the

431
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:31,038
catkins size but they both produce

432
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:35,989
edible nuts

433
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:39,200
the Silbert nut so we did a propagation

434
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:41,450
we looked at several difficult to root

435
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,090
natives the new jersey t here's the

436
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,720
beech filbert northern Bush honeysuckle

437
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:50,868
and viburnum a seraph Oleum and we found

438
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,200
that you can get pretty good rooting if

439
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:54,819
you take cuttings in July treat them

440
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,840
with

441
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,538
at least three thousand

442
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:01,629
parts-per-million IBA you can route the

443
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:03,908
beach filbert pretty well and then we

444
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,990
took the plants from this study and some

445
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,509
of the others and put them in a

446
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,509
container production study and this was

447
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:13,028
looking at shale as a media amendment

448
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,009
trying to recreate those dry gravelly

449
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:18,460
soils you see this in along the sides of

450
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,440
the roads in Connecticut and it didn't

451
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,840
really matter it grew well in all media

452
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,190
so you can use a standard bark pizza to

453
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:28,808
grow nice-looking big children's so

454
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,370
another plant that was not in the

455
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:32,829
parking lot study but was in these

456
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:35,768
propagation studies was maple leaf by

457
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:38,859
Burnham by Burnham Acer folium this is a

458
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:41,798
great shade plant dry shady conditions

459
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:44,288
it's a highly sought after plant for the

460
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:46,778
foliage it's this maple leaf looking

461
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:49,720
foliage it gets wonderful fall color

462
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:52,000
this is a seedling in the woods some of

463
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,909
the natural history descriptions of

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,378
these plants are beautiful writing about

465
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:59,289
you know this plant in this kind of

466
00:20:56,378 --> 00:21:02,528
ghostly fall pinkish white yellow color

467
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:05,440
and so it's really sought after by

468
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:08,138
nurseryman as well but it's very hard to

469
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,600
propagate so they buy it in as rooted

470
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:15,869
cuttings or they buy it in his side bare

471
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:18,658
root and it was hard to to propagate it

472
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,008
has the typical viburnum flowers

473
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:22,870
clusters of small white flowers they're

474
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,940
pink and buds so sometimes you get pink

475
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:30,250
buds and white flowers at the same time

476
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:34,570
and blue-black fruits and so we did this

477
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:38,648
plant as well so and we did single node

478
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:40,599
cuttings and then we also tried two node

479
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:44,258
cuttings and had a hundred percent

480
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:47,230
rooting with two node cuttings so that's

481
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:50,829
the trick with this plant the problem is

482
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:53,200
when people are take collecting native

483
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:56,109
plants from the wild you're not going to

484
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,519
readily get a vegetative chute where you

485
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:59,798
can take two node cuttings you're going

486
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,370
to see a single node a pair of leaves

487
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:06,038
and then a flower and that roots not as

488
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,919
well more in the like fifty sixty

489
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:11,849
percent so

490
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:14,640
and also if you give a plant time in

491
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:16,199
container production you may find taking

492
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,940
cuttings from container plants will

493
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,519
yield better results and sometimes

494
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,740
you'll get vegetative shoots when you're

495
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,720
growing a plant in a bark peeps and mix

496
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,460
with high fertility it'll go more

497
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,059
vegetative and then you can take

498
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,950
cuttings so we found two nodes and it's

499
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:35,039
hard to see but there was there are two

500
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,460
nodes on this this is the grow out after

501
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,990
a winter so we told growers that

502
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,690
hopefully they're trying that and we

503
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,660
also looked at pruning to try to yield a

504
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,570
more dense plant in a pot so people like

505
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:51,720
to get plants that have you know nice

506
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,909
rounded uniform canopy in a container

507
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,850
not kind of you know pigtail in a pot

508
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,500
like a lot of natives look like and soap

509
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:00,869
root you can prune these plants as well

510
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:08,940
to get a more uniform height to width

511
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:11,239
ratio so this is the second study the

512
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,390
parking lots which were established in

513
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:19,259
2012 and in this year we had heavy deer

514
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:22,320
pressure so we use that as a measure we

515
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:24,779
evaluated deer browse or deer of every

516
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,109
based on the rating system so here you

517
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:29,460
can see natives like the prunus

518
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:31,139
cumulative oppressor the creeping sand

519
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,360
cherry elderberry

520
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,780
the gray dogwood and round leaf dogwood

521
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:40,169
we had a spicebush we had blueberry as

522
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:42,089
kind of a pseudo control and Virginia

523
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:47,370
rose and sweet bells with the same two

524
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:52,099
invasive controls the blueberry is a

525
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:54,750
plant that from from day one has been

526
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:57,179
popularized as an alternative for the

527
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,279
burning bush but there's a lot of mixed

528
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,210
reports on how well it establishes in a

529
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,059
tough landscape

530
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,340
it likes acidic soils and while it's

531
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:09,210
drought tolerant once established it

532
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:11,369
requires I find regular watering to get

533
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,840
it established so you can't just put it

534
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,989
in the ground and you set it and forget

535
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,759
it like a burning bush so it was kind of

536
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,670
in there as let's see how it did and it

537
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,269
didn't do that well one of the lowest

538
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,660
survival

539
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:27,389
rates after two years it had a little

540
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,850
bit of deer browse actually and you know

541
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,220
not a great aesthetic rating whereas

542
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:35,279
plants like this unknown plant the sweet

543
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,390
bells u-boat rest's racing also used to

544
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:41,519
be Lakota we're a samosa did really well

545
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:44,790
Virginia Rose did well the dogwoods had

546
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,440
a quite a bit of deer browse same thing

547
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:50,190
with the spicebush not the greatest

548
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,200
survival good amount of deer browse so I

549
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,299
want to talk about this plant sweet

550
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,730
bells and about the creeping sand cherry

551
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:01,710
and a couple of other plants so this is

552
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:05,039
the sweet bells it has bell shaped

553
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,079
flowers with a very light fragrance it

554
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,059
looks kind of like a blueberry but a

555
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,099
little bit denser than a blueberry and a

556
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,440
lot tougher than a blueberry easy to

557
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:16,429
establish here are the plants in a

558
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,460
parking lot island and it gets some

559
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:24,299
plants some ecotypes get really nice red

560
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:29,009
fall color it's very easy to propagate

561
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:32,309
from cuttings you know seventy to eighty

562
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:34,289
eight percent with no hormone so it's

563
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:37,500
very easy to propagate which is good for

564
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:39,829
grows grows fast in a pot you can cheer

565
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,809
it and stick those cuttings at any time

566
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:44,309
we did a shade production study with

567
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:46,740
these plants and a couple of other

568
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,109
species and found you know you can grow

569
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,569
them right under full Sun or under forty

570
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:54,629
percent shade and they will make a nice

571
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:57,029
kind of height to with uniform ratio

572
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:02,250
with a good number of shoots these are

573
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:05,849
one gallon sized pots in this study we

574
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,529
also looked at hobble Bush and in the

575
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:09,359
propagation study we looked at how much

576
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:11,309
so this one wasn't in the parking lot

577
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,069
Islands because it's a shade plant kind

578
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:17,429
of like the Maple Leaf viburnum it likes

579
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:20,039
cool climates it likes moist soils but

580
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,620
well-drained its kind of picky but it's

581
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,309
a gorgeous plant a highly sought after

582
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:29,459
plant it gets these red fruits these big

583
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:32,730
leaves fuzzy leaves a little bit fuzzy

584
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,069
these white lacecap flowers fuzzy buds

585
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,710
so it's really sought asked

586
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:40,319
among native plant enthusiasts very

587
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:43,860
difficult to propagate from cuttings and

588
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:47,519
it's not that easy from seed I've never

589
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:50,308
tried it but that's what I hear so I

590
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,788
don't know if we just came across the

591
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:57,178
right plant in Massachusetts that roots

592
00:26:53,788 --> 00:27:00,329
but we rooted it pretty well we had you

593
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,679
know 70% rooting with three thousand one

594
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:04,109
thousand two eight thousand

595
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,929
parts-per-million IBA this is what they

596
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:08,339
were short little shoots so one little

597
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,190
note because that's all you can get off

598
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:12,928
of the landscape so there were these

599
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,970
short little shoots that were barely in

600
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,639
the media and these leaves eventually

601
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:20,190
just dried up and came right off over

602
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:21,658
the winter and this is the outgrowth the

603
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,220
following spring they were potted up

604
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,080
before they leapt out or as they were

605
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,710
starting to and here they're they're

606
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:31,740
growing out and then we put this plan in

607
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,308
that shade study so a typical bark

608
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,200
Pete's and mix and they definitely

609
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:40,048
benefit from growing in shade we had

610
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,019
leaf burn and full Sun even some leaf

611
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:44,970
coloring discoloring in 40% shade but

612
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:48,028
you can get you know a nice looking

613
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:52,909
container plant with shade seventy

614
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:55,440
percent shade the creeping sand cherry

615
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:57,720
this is it in the parking lot island so

616
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,038
you almost can't tell that it's there

617
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,720
and the outside landscaping crew

618
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,778
couldn't tell that it was there so they

619
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,860
mowed over it a couple of times but it's

620
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:14,009
a great low less than a foot plant with

621
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:15,898
these kind of linear leaves that emerge

622
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:18,179
a little bit after the flowers or just

623
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:20,339
as the flowers are emerging they have a

624
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:24,899
classic kind of rose AC flower

625
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:26,730
I've peddled white flower silver

626
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:29,819
undersides to the leaves that can get

627
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,679
kind of a red burgundy fall color this

628
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:34,589
is in our lilac garden on the UConn

629
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,909
campus over some some slate so very low

630
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:40,859
growing this is the the native knoll

631
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:45,419
that we call it at my house this rocky

632
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:47,699
area these were one two there were three

633
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,550
maybe five of these from a one gallon

634
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,190
pot

635
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:55,240
and this was it maybe last year so it's

636
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,860
a great kind of facer plant or along the

637
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,259
edge of a driveway or something where

638
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:02,049
you get hot baking Sun and then it'll

639
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,940
it'll do just fine this is kind of the

640
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,500
other view of the rock that's my son

641
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,450
several years ago so you can see it's

642
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,069
kind of like a driveway planting just

643
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,890
kind of creeping over for a rock garden

644
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:13,720
it's very easy to root cuttings these

645
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,660
are actually cuttings from Canterbury

646
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:20,670
horticultural nursery in Connecticut and

647
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:24,460
you can get nice dense 1 gallon pots

648
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:26,470
this is a cultivar that Mark developed

649
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,910
mark sitting right there he's from UConn

650
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,279
he crossed

651
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:33,130
prunus cumulative Araya t de presa and

652
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:35,200
prunus Susquehanna so it's a it's a

653
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,990
creeping plant with a little bit larger

654
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,420
leaf the same white flowers and red fall

655
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,220
color grows really well in a container

656
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:49,870
and a university I think is looking to

657
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:53,230
as well you know native plants that

658
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:56,500
behave well in a landscape and still

659
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:59,250
offer wildlife benefits I think is what

660
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,049
the nursery industry is looking for now

661
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,940
this plant deer berry is one that I've

662
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,859
been working on recently and I have a

663
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,980
paper coming out native plants journal

664
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:12,789
this fall on micro propagation so deer

665
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:15,370
berry has a pretty broad native range it

666
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:18,549
can be really big and it can get more

667
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:21,009
compact like this specimen here it's in

668
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,889
the blueberry group but it doesn't

669
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:26,650
produce sweet tasting fruits they're

670
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:29,860
edible but not really palatable but it

671
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:32,530
is being used in blueberry breeding to

672
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:35,859
introduce kind of exotic flavors and

673
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:37,899
colors and upload adaptation so it's

674
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:40,240
it's drought taught more drought

675
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,930
tolerant so this is kind of at my house

676
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,640
by rock here and these are some of the

677
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,930
ornamental features this is from the

678
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,850
publication which is why it's all

679
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,360
labeled up like this you know you get

680
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:54,490
these kind of star like flowers in

681
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,919
abundance you get the fruit is usually

682
00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:00,880
starts out greenish to blue and then it

683
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,110
turns these kind of burgundy orangey

684
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,210
colors it

685
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:06,909
can get nice read fall color like the

686
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,880
blueberries do it does not root well

687
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:12,308
from cuttings at all so that's what we

688
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,500
tried first with poor root systems and

689
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:16,599
then we thought let's try it in tissue

690
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,490
culture and we looked at different iron

691
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,169
supplements in tissue culture because

692
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,200
sometimes the leaves looked a little

693
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,480
chlorotic and we did routing and it

694
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,940
propagates you know with 80% success

695
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,519
from for micro propagation so that's one

696
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,730
way to go about it for breeders or

697
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,470
growers looking for this plant here they

698
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,269
are acclimating and a salad tray

699
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:42,548
acclimating to the greenhouse and these

700
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:45,250
are one gallon containers so I'm still

701
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:47,710
working with native plans I have a grad

702
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,929
student right now looking at pollinator

703
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,350
visitation on native shrubs and their

704
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:54,610
cultivars so native plants when I first

705
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:57,039
started working with them they were

706
00:31:54,609 --> 00:32:00,639
desirable as alternatives to invasives

707
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,859
and now when the PHA later concern and

708
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,230
worry hit it was all about you need

709
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:07,449
native plants for pollinators and then

710
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,669
you started to hear some group saying

711
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,308
that the cultivars of native plants were

712
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:15,309
not as supportive of pollinators as the

713
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:18,399
wild type species and you know that

714
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:21,190
concerns growers and that's not really

715
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,480
based in scientific study so we did a

716
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,769
study we collected some native shrubs

717
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,690
species and their cultivars and put them

718
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:31,839
in a planting behind our greenhouse and

719
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:35,650
this is my master student Jacob and he's

720
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:38,079
counting insect visitation and this work

721
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:41,559
is is wrapping itself up so hopefully

722
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:43,210
we'll get get this out soon and and most

723
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,339
of the cultivars are very good at

724
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,950
supporting pollinators there's a few

725
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:51,308
that have dramatic changes like a flower

726
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:57,419
color that maybe attract a different

727
00:32:51,308 --> 00:33:00,099
suite of pollinators but not always and

728
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:03,549
many of the cultivars that just exhibit

729
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:06,609
a more compact habit attract just as

730
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:10,119
many pollinators of the same type and

731
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:13,569
some even have greater floral density

732
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,339
and attract more pollinators another

733
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:16,929
thing I'm working on is looking at

734
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:20,740
developing

735
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:23,320
local native cultivars so looking at

736
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,359
local ecotypes and which ones exhibit

737
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:26,950
the best ornamental qualities and

738
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,899
adaptability because this is a you boat

739
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,940
restoration mosa from Connecticut and

740
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,070
this is a you boat restoration mosa from

741
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,779
Connecticut and one clearly is more you

742
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:36,339
know you know I think you know prides

743
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,710
corner would be more interested in

744
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:40,149
picking up this plant than this one and

745
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,160
there's certainly more interested in

746
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,980
growing them vegetatively so they can

747
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,680
offer a uniform crop and from seed so

748
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,720
which is not just germinate swell but

749
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,180
they're itty bitty bitty seeds with this

750
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,289
plant so it's kind of a pain to deal

751
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:58,870
with them in a plug tray and that's it

752
00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:47,289
by one o'clock I think that was right so

753
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:49,299
any questions okay well I mean maybe

754
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:51,190
that should be tested you know cuz maybe

755
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,720
they will tolerate outside I don't know

756
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,360
you put them in and they haven't done

757
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:00,879
well they're here according to the

758
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:03,130
native maps but okay well I think that

759
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,829
with native plants it is going to be a

760
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,200
regional issue so I mean there's some

761
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:09,579
plants that have a really broad range

762
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,829
but that's one of the issues with the

763
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:14,380
whole patenting cultivar process and

764
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,029
trying to get our tech transfer people

765
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,090
to realize that you can't necessarily

766
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:21,519
market these plants across you know the

767
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,880
nursery industry like you can a bar

768
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:28,739
berry so it with native selections it's

769
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,740
going to be a more regional focus

770
00:35:31,340 --> 00:36:05,160
right yeah well like yeah I think that

771
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:08,759
on the western half of Connecticut they

772
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,190
have more limestone e soils as well but

773
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,890
some of the plants might do okay like

774
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,929
this I didn't include the spiraea but

775
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:17,730
the tomentosa is being looked at in the

776
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:20,759
Midwest and they've done actually I

777
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:23,880
think some pH studies Minnesota maybe

778
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,650
with that plan yeah so tomentosa so

779
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:31,400
that's one so maybe some of these others

780
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:31,400
but yeah it has been a more kind of pH

781
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,700
yeah okay consider that thank you

782
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:55,410
okay okay so with the pollinators where

783
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:57,119
they're native and non-native colonies

784
00:36:55,409 --> 00:37:02,250
yes so I mean we looked at the honeybees

785
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:04,019
and which is not native and yeah I think

786
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,429
he looked at I mean for some things I

787
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:08,219
think he had about he has about twelve

788
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:14,279
insect groups so he had like hover flies

789
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:16,919
and mining bees and bumblebees honey

790
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,640
bees and then he had smaller groupings

791
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,460
you know like other flies and sweat bees

792
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,009
so he had maybe three or four B groups

793
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,420
and then a couple of fly groups and then

794
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,630
he had like an other group he had the

795
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,190
butterflies and you know moths group but

796
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,079
you didn't see that much of but he

797
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:36,079
didn't look at night so

798
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,289
well like like with aronia for example

799
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:47,968
we looked at a wild representative

800
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:50,579
aronia and then we looked at two compact

801
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:52,979
cultivars of aronia which really didn't

802
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,739
have a change in flower color and there

803
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:58,348
was no significant difference in the

804
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:01,710
insect visitation on a compact form in

805
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:03,960
fact with Clara we looked at ruby spice

806
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,999
we looked at a wild type and then we

807
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,099
looked at hummingbird and hummingbird

808
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:11,879
actually produces more flowers per

809
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,130
square in the area of plant and it had

810
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,190
more pollinators in some of the insect

811
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:21,509
categories but the ruby spice differed

812
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,039
in a couple of maybe one situation not

813
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:25,699
much difference there we looked at

814
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,469
Potentilla the wild Potentilla

815
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:30,659
goldfinger and pink beauty and we saw

816
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:33,210
differences there we saw differences

817
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:37,318
between the purple and the green and 9

818
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:39,690
bar and some differences with hydrangea

819
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:46,440
we looked at Annabelle which is largely

820
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:50,309
sterile florets yes nursery industry

821
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,719
tends to be fairly conservative so I'm

822
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:58,259
wondering what successes you've had in

823
00:38:53,719 --> 00:39:00,838
introducing these native shrubs to the

824
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:04,199
nursery industry and what methods you

825
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:07,588
use to try to attract that you know good

826
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,679
question so how am i bringing these

827
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:13,828
plants to the growers so I did have a

828
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,768
grant that allowed me to propagate and

829
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:19,829
give them plants to trial and recruit

830
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:22,139
growers to an advisory group so I worked

831
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,839
with about 5 growers directly Prydz

832
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:27,028
corner farms Canterbury court planners

833
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:31,608
choice broke an hour which is more kind

834
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:31,608
of a specialty plant design build and

835
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:39,358
Summer Hill and so I gave them the

836
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,150
plants to trial and then I repeatedly

837
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:45,298
asked for feedback and I visited the

838
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,309
nursery and I think probably about 3 or

839
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:50,670
4 species have been added so they like

840
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:53,220
the prune is pew Muller they like I have

841
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:56,570
viburnum land - nowadays

842
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:59,250
no sorry at luncheon Arnie's that one I

843
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,750
don't know if they were I used the ice

844
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,409
gave that to a couple of specialty

845
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,940
nurseries

846
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:07,619
so the viburnum cast annuities are

847
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:11,429
newton cast annuities that one america

848
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,469
Gale they're growing they had been

849
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:15,629
growing calm tonyia and I'm holding a

850
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:17,969
grower workshop this winter for the new

851
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,289
propagation method I'm cutting so

852
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:22,859
hopefully hands-on

853
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:25,380
well dig side for shoots and let them

854
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:30,329
head propagator stick the cuttings and

855
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:33,030
then see where to plant and let's see

856
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:37,489
but they are like the big nurseries are

857
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:43,380
looking for selections of natives now so

858
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:47,909
prides and Monrovia and you know like

859
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:51,390
the Bailey and spring meadow they they

860
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:54,389
are looking for selections so if you

861
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:55,889
have unique germ plasm of a native I

862
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:58,109
think that's the way they want to go

863
00:40:55,889 --> 00:41:00,739
with up with a cultivar selection

864
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:03,450
because the consumer wants a named plan

865
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:09,000
it's a small group of consumers that

866
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:11,069
want a wild type plant so so I think

867
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,380
about three or four species and that the

868
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,030
species may vary slightly so one of the

869
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,450
plants that I really like is round leaf

870
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:22,800
dogwood and it in its showing a lot of

871
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:24,389
promise with drought tolerance and just

872
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,190
one grower was just not interested in it

873
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:27,750
and then another one of the growers got

874
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,789
the prunus I don't know what he did with

875
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,650
it and then all of a sudden now he's got

876
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:33,059
people asking for people ask me and I

877
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,470
said well go try this grower who

878
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,150
actually when they asked me where can I

879
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:39,149
get it but didn't they give it to you

880
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,769
but then I said oh I think Canterbury

881
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,840
still has some and he went and got it

882
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:46,469
from there so it takes a while to catch

883
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,480
on certainly takes a while and then and

884
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:52,189
then they're like oh yeah we should be

885
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,190
growing that we're asking for that now

886
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:06,239
yeah I think they certainly will support

887
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,170
nectar foraging pollinators that's what

888
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,669
I've looked at we

889
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,769
looked at the underside of the leaves

890
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,079
for the larvae or the caterpillars and

891
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:15,719
that that certainly could be done you

892
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,880
could look at night foraging pollinators

893
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:20,669
as well which Jacobs not a night person

894
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,608
and I've concluded someone for that but

895
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,289
so we just wanted to look a little bit

896
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:27,179
just try to provide a little bit of

897
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,980
science to people as they make their

898
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:30,899
decisions and what's the best for their

899
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,099
landscape so I mean if you're doing

900
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,298
restoration

901
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,309
you know you not don't want to

902
00:42:33,298 --> 00:42:39,480
necessarily put Ruby spice in not that

903
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:42,890
it didn't derive as a sport and may may

904
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,889
prepare you know be out there

905
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:49,259
III think they certainly can I think a

906
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:52,200
lot of non natives can as well but so I

907
00:42:49,260 --> 00:43:04,049
think they can support natives quite

908
00:42:52,199 --> 00:43:06,088
well insects right well thank you this
