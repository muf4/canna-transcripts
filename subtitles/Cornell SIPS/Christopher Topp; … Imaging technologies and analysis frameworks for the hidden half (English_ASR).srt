1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,070
that Thank You Alina and Mike for

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,809
inviting me I'd really appreciate the

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,960
opportunity

6
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:19,039
oh sorry can you hear me with this mic

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,810
okay great

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,720
okay yeah so as Elina said we I'm sort

9
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:29,809
of known as a root imaging and root

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:32,359
analysis person but it's really we're

11
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:34,250
interested in how the plant functions as

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,229
a whole and how shoots and roots are

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,170
integrated the way a plant actually

14
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:42,019
works and so this is actually data from

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,820
the pet imaging system my colleague

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,920
colleague on Shanthi at the Wash U

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,320
Medical School so you're actually

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,230
watching carbon being fixed in the

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,299
leaves and moving down into the roots

20
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,379
and in real time using pet and I'll tell

21
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:58,819
you a little bit more about how this

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:01,010
works later in the talk but again as I

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,450
think we all understand if we want to

24
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,099
understand the plant as an integrated

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,049
system it's usually the roots were where

26
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,329
we where we stop right these are the

27
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,539
bottlenecks so this is a classic image

28
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,679
of two grass roots interacting with one

29
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,780
another so there's just you know one

30
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:17,179
little shoot up here they're quite an

31
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,739
extensive root system so this is one

32
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:21,310
scale the architecture of the root

33
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,649
system that we can look at roots but

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,810
similarly there's a at each of these

35
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,789
many thousands of root tips there's

36
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,460
actually a microenvironment here the

37
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:33,439
rhizosphere so this is a the inside of a

38
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:35,239
barley root you can see the root hairs

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,248
here the soil particles this is where

40
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,349
the microbiome is happening so there's a

41
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:43,519
lot of dynamic activity across a lot of

42
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:45,288
scales so suffice to say roots are an

43
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,780
incredible challenge not just to see but

44
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:51,138
but in their complexity at many levels

45
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,909
and so from an applied standpoint we

46
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:55,399
often think about the concept of idiot

47
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,618
type breeding which was developed by cm

48
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,049
Donald in the 60s but an idiot type is

49
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,700
basically a model plant trade for a

50
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,499
particular environment or agronomic

51
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,219
practice and it was a big deal in the

52
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:09,169
Green Revolution and the idea is to

53
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:10,679
breathe for certain plant characters or

54
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,068
plant traits rather than simply

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,739
for yield or for reduced defects in

56
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:18,208
yield but as you might imagine Donald

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,569
didn't have a lot to say about what the

58
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,688
below ground video types are nonetheless

59
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,518
all the water all the nutrients and and

60
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:28,289
quite a bit of interactions with the

61
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,539
environment come through the roots and

62
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:34,289
through the soil and so this is a really

63
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:36,658
key area that we focus on in the lab so

64
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,209
this is how those images that you saw

65
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:41,669
this is from John Weaver's papers really

66
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:45,389
pioneered this sort of archaeological

67
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:47,280
approach to seeing and understanding

68
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:50,129
root systems in the soil this is

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,590
literally what they were doing to the

70
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,358
early 1900's and through the 50s and as

71
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,938
you can imagine the throughput was was

72
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,709
quite low

73
00:02:55,938 --> 00:03:01,168
unfortunately 85 years later we're

74
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,889
literally this is still States state of

75
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:08,099
the art and this is not much hyperbole

76
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,959
here and so of the different ways that

77
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,479
we can actually look at roots in the

78
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,569
field each one has a very limited

79
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,768
perspective it's a very sparse idea of

80
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:18,268
the whole root system so there is a

81
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,189
phenotypic reality it's three

82
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,039
dimensional it's actually growing so

83
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,199
it's a four dimensional reality and each

84
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,698
of these root tips is growing along and

85
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,219
it's microenvironment it adds up to a

86
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:32,549
total architecture these are the methods

87
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:35,188
we can use today in the field excavating

88
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,260
soil cores many raisa Tron's which is a

89
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:39,719
clear - but the camera we can just see

90
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,959
the roots growing along the tube or root

91
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,329
crown excavations AKA shovel omics and

92
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,128
so just the idea here is that there's

93
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,629
course useful information we can get but

94
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,908
it's only a little sliver of the real

95
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:53,280
picture of phenotypic reality and it's

96
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:54,688
sort of a theme in my work so we're not

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,299
only interested in seeing the root

98
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:59,728
system but sort of making sense of the

99
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,688
complexity as well and tying different

100
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,579
forms of data together so ultimately my

101
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:07,650
group is interested in understanding the

102
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,840
genetic basis of root growth and route

103
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,180
environment interaction

104
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,840
and we very much take take a kitchen

105
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,160
sink approach and there's two general

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,959
axes here you know one is just

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,419
experiments we can control the

108
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,449
information content and on the other end

109
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:26,569
what's actually relative is a field soil

110
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,009
is actually relative to to agriculture

111
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,230
and so there's a number of different

112
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,839
methods and I'll touch on most of these

113
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,750
today but we take these these the

114
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,149
kitchen sink and we throw it at what I

115
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,579
like to call high resolution germ plasm

116
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,649
and the resolution is the resolution to

117
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,539
identify genes that are controlling

118
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,219
these traits and so I'll tell you a

119
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,350
little bit about the Illinois long term

120
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,780
selection experiment in maize and how

121
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,720
we're using these tools to identify

122
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:56,149
genes in a little bit first I'll start

123
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,070
with an imaging system for looking at

124
00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:01,370
roots that was actually developed here

125
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:03,259
in Leon coaching's group at Cornell this

126
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,879
is optical projection tomography and

127
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,269
there's there's many of Leon's

128
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,009
former lab here at least Randy Clark was

129
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:12,289
the one and John shaft who really

130
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,680
pioneered this it's nothing more than

131
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,539
growing a plant in a big glass jar with

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,639
fertilizer and gel and spinning it

133
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:22,519
around on a turntable so here we have a

134
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,589
camera and an illuminator and we're

135
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,879
basically capturing silhouette images as

136
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,219
a rotating so we capture

137
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,159
three-dimensional information about the

138
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,830
roots and from that we can actually make

139
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,900
a three-dimensional model once we have

140
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:37,250
this model in hand we have to figure out

141
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,739
what to measure about it so we literally

142
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,228
have now phenotypic reality but how do

143
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,210
we capture all the variation here well

144
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:45,859
typically we start with the things that

145
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:47,959
we could measure maybe by hand or with a

146
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,050
ruler previously and then we get into

147
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,060
fancy stuff like shape analysis like

148
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,879
topological features or how the roots

149
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,439
curve over time things like this so

150
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,418
there's a lot of information we can get

151
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,699
but I'd like you to keep in mind that

152
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:03,699
these are really they're discrete traits

153
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,579
and they're ad hoc so they're basically

154
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:09,379
our human idea of what is important for

155
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:11,389
the root system and and to some extent

156
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:14,418
this may be limiting our ability to

157
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,129
understand roots and identify genes and

158
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:18,199
I'll give you a little bit of example so

159
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,879
I'm skipping ahead but we use this

160
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,159
method to map

161
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,230
the root architecture of a rice mapping

162
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,689
population so it's an upland and a

163
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,610
lowland the rice Phalaenopsis ain't a

164
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,719
recombinant inbred line so mike

165
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:36,270
explained qtls and rills earlier today

166
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,220
so basically what I'm showing you here

167
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,829
is just a few different chromosomes

168
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,290
where we found qtls and hopefully you

169
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:45,060
can kind of see the shaded areas the

170
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,180
color map this is where we found lots of

171
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,069
qtls of these univariate QTL so again

172
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,079
you know we may have found one for

173
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,889
bushing us or one for root system volume

174
00:06:52,079 --> 00:07:00,120
or maybe even together in the same QTL

175
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,769
here okay but we we then we're wondering

176
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,269
well what's at which QTL should we

177
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,419
actually pursue which of these traits

178
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:09,149
actually matters most and this is where

179
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,800
we're working with homage olds I started

180
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,259
to get a perspective a multivariate

181
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,060
perspective about phenotype so what Tom

182
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,439
did is he took this whole list of traits

183
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,930
everything we could measure in Jill

184
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,569
Anderson and Ray in his lab and just

185
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,000
used a manova and basically used a

186
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,170
multivariate manova as the trait so a

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,720
similar thing would be to use a

188
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,960
principal component and map on a

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,640
principal component and the point of

190
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,039
this slide is just to show you we found

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,569
five multivariate qtls the ones in red

192
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,310
here and this is the effect size so

193
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,659
they're pretty large and red here these

194
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,280
are ones that we found with the

195
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,470
univariate traits previously so we

196
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,619
already had evidence that there was some

197
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,090
genes controlling the trait of interest

198
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,389
but in green here there was no evidence

199
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:53,639
of univariate QTL meaning we would not

200
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,709
have found this using these discrete and

201
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,180
ad-hoc traits and I think this is a very

202
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:02,009
important concept in in phenotyping in

203
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,449
general and I think all the speakers

204
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,029
this morning have really hit on the fact

205
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,789
that there's lots of information and

206
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:12,089
that together they tell the picture and

207
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,620
maybe not alone so a really beautiful

208
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,269
thing about this gel albeit an

209
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,649
artificial system of course is it's

210
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,839
non-destructive and so we can actually

211
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,310
look at the fourth dimension in time so

212
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,500
we think about plant environment

213
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,259
interactions or dynamics or processes

214
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,779
all of these all these words involve

215
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,930
time they imply time and so to not look

216
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,528
at them over time is severely limiting

217
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,870
so here we're looking at two

218
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,860
breadlines and we can see that there's

219
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,538
there's very different route

220
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,399
architectures but what you would like to

221
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:41,229
know is how the growth of each of these

222
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,879
individual routes how it goes from one

223
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,069
route to many hundreds of routes over

224
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,930
the course of seven days and how that

225
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:48,490
processes so how are they different as a

226
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:51,489
function of time and their growth

227
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,528
processes rather than just a static time

228
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,120
point so this is an automated imaging

229
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:57,399
system we have in the lab it's just

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,470
every four hours or whatever we decide

231
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,639
to program it at it runs day and night

232
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,790
and so we get these really nice

233
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,980
time-resolved datasets we've also

234
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,808
developed a software it's dynamic routes

235
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,699
published a couple years ago takes these

236
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:11,769
3d models and it allows us to actually

237
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:13,328
measure the growth of each individual

238
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,490
route in the context of the whole route

239
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:17,588
system over time so we can track

240
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,659
individual routes we can look at very

241
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,990
highly resolve level temporally and

242
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:25,480
spatially so this is work of needs yang

243
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,329
a postdoc in the lab so again just these

244
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,180
two different maize genotypes here we're

245
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:34,568
looking at a route length and so if you

246
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:36,458
just focus here it's shown as a density

247
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:38,979
plot so it was a function of the total

248
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,958
so basically in blue here these are

249
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,879
relatively shorter routes compared to

250
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,938
the relatively longer routes and that's

251
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,230
the same here for Missouri 17 and so

252
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:49,750
this is just to show you that the

253
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,730
beginning v73 has relatively longer

254
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,198
routes and that continues for some

255
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,360
period of time but at some point there's

256
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:57,758
really a flush of lateral roots and then

257
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,308
the the architecture continues with many

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,528
smaller routes rather than many longer

259
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,688
routes where azmuth missouri 17 over

260
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:06,759
time invest more in the routes that it

261
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:09,519
actually has and grow the grozny lateral

262
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,528
roots out rather than making more new

263
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,419
ones if then that makes sense so this

264
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,730
has really could be thought of as a

265
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:18,639
foraging strategy it's definitely a

266
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,920
growth characteristic that has

267
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,948
implications for how the plant is able

268
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,229
to forage for nutrients and and

269
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:28,088
resources in the soil you can also see

270
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,579
that you know clearly depending on where

271
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,959
you looked at your trade of interest you

272
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:34,568
would get different answers so if you

273
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,068
looked here it tells you one thing here

274
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:39,009
they're very similar and here you get a

275
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:40,719
different answer so similarly this is

276
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,699
just a number of lateral roots so that

277
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,019
you know basically what I showed you

278
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:45,439
before but you can see they're very

279
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,318
similar numbers and

280
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,269
some point at which b73 ramps up and

281
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:53,149
moves across so how do we actually

282
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,190
capture all this information in a more

283
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,889
comprehensive way so really in a

284
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,430
function rather than discrete values and

285
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:05,600
so we've we've we've started modeling

286
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:07,370
these these growth curves and so taking

287
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,899
this these patterns and the data and

288
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,519
converting them into a few variables

289
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,438
that we can then use to probe the

290
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,068
behavior and uses traits for the

291
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:18,679
genetics so this is again very basic

292
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:20,240
function most most biological things

293
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,799
start growing and they grow kind of like

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,230
an S and that is modeled well by a

295
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,169
logistic function and so you don't need

296
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,420
to read all this I'm just obligatory

297
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:30,769
showing you the equation here but the

298
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:33,948
point is that there's just a few

299
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,688
variables that we can use to capture the

300
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:37,909
data so it's probably better looked at

301
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:41,509
here again this is total route length

302
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:42,919
b73 Missouri 17 so at the final time

303
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:45,980
point this is after about a week of

304
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,929
growth these 73 has a more total route

305
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,269
length but it's pretty similar okay and

306
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:53,629
this this value is captured by one of

307
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:56,328
the one of the parameters the carrying

308
00:11:53,629 --> 00:12:00,019
capacity alpha one and so we can see

309
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:01,849
that oops we can see that here where the

310
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,149
alpha one it's a little bit bigger for B

311
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:07,129
73 but not statistically different then

312
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,860
there's another tray the inflection

313
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,269
point which is where the growth rate

314
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,490
actually you can see it here better so

315
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,230
the growth rate is speeding up for B 73

316
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,519
and then it starts to slow down so the

317
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,230
inflection point would be right in the

318
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,899
middle and it would be somewhere on this

319
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,209
curve the 317 ramps up a little slower

320
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,519
but then it ramps down a little slower

321
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:29,318
as well and that's captured by this

322
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,448
value the slope of the line is captured

323
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:35,929
by these other two values and so

324
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:38,058
essentially we are were distilling these

325
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:40,549
growth patterns into variables that we

326
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:43,219
can then use to to differentiate the

327
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:46,758
genotypes or eventually to map James

328
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,290
okay so switching things up a little

329
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,209
this is what we can do with very high

330
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:52,159
resolution data where we can see and

331
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,169
know the whole route system course out

332
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,208
in the field which is where we really

333
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,240
want to know how

334
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:01,058
we grow and behave it's a lot different

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,240
so again this is a field of corn that's

336
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:06,009
a foot with a shovel that's a tank where

337
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,568
we soak the roots this is our mobile

338
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:09,339
field lab so it's got air conditioning

339
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:11,708
it's humane we drive it around from

340
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,350
field to field pile out of the back and

341
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,549
just dig lots and lots of roots and but

342
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,619
what you're looking at here instead of

343
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:19,178
measuring this by hand this is actually

344
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,410
a light and there's a camera inside of

345
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:22,539
it maybe you can see it here it's a

346
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:24,730
little dark but we take formal portraits

347
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:27,368
of the roots and we actually use image

348
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,459
analysis methods to measure the roots

349
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:33,459
rather than to measure them by hand and

350
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:36,549
so for this we as a software called dirt

351
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:38,588
and dirt is now on I plan it's free so

352
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,448
no excuse for anyone not to look at the

353
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,619
roots anymore just wash them off take a

354
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:43,990
formal portrait and there's a lot of

355
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:46,389
information we can capture then from

356
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,639
these two-dimensional images and so I'm

357
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:50,829
going to skip over this quickly actually

358
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,829
but there's a plan genome project where

359
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:57,328
we're doing a lot of this work and this

360
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:59,919
is at the core of it we're studying the

361
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:02,048
illinois high and low protein lines so

362
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,990
these are these lines have been bred

363
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:07,240
since 1898 for either high or low seed

364
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,769
protein content all this protein is

365
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,600
storing nitrogen so these are really

366
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,659
good at taking of nitrogen and these art

367
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,110
so to the extent that root architecture

368
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:18,368
should be conditioned by our nitrogen

369
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,110
uptake should be conditioned by root

370
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,990
architecture we should see that the

371
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,539
difference and so in the roots and so

372
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,678
for high and low protein you look

373
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,208
different to you there's something

374
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:29,409
different about them but what is it well

375
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,149
dirt kind of gives us a lot of

376
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:34,298
information about what it what it could

377
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,948
be and so if you cross these two things

378
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:38,230
together this is just phenotypic

379
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:39,789
variation and the real line so variation

380
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,899
is good if you're trying to map traits

381
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:47,289
and we've now used this too in a G Watts

382
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:49,629
analysis to identify candidate or snips

383
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:50,860
that are near candidate genes that we

384
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,778
think may be controlling root

385
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,639
architecture that has some bearing on

386
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:56,919
nitrogen uptake so this is the work of a

387
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,169
postdoc in the lab Jiang bean Lu here's

388
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,509
an example on chromosome 10 where we've

389
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:03,610
now we've drilled down to a candidate

390
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,409
gene that we think is controlling brood

391
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,230
architecture

392
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:09,028
and we have a number of these genes so

393
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,399
the traits really don't matter this one

394
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:13,078
is for root system with but again the

395
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,149
trade these traits are just capturing

396
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,439
some variation in the root phenotype I

397
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:20,039
they're not really meant to be taken

398
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,689
literally as my perspective so I'm

399
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,629
showing you here the sorghum ortholog

400
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:26,219
identity because we actually found

401
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,839
mutation at existing library and sorghum

402
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,089
so we think it's doing a very similar

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,709
thing in sorghum as our candidate gene

404
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,899
there's the wild type that we can see

405
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:36,838
clear root phenotypes here so we think

406
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,159
we're getting close to identifying genes

407
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,439
and this is important because we know

408
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,559
almost nothing about quantitative

409
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:47,009
genetics that control root architecture

410
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:49,409
so another part of this project and the

411
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,490
NSF partially funded and the other half

412
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,139
of the money came from valent

413
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,389
Biosciences who are working with on

414
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,329
rhizosphere interactions mycorrhizal

415
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:59,850
fungi and arise obeah and nodulation

416
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:02,219
this is an industrial scale x-ray

417
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,589
imaging system the x-5000 so you'll find

418
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,920
this in factory floors and automobile

419
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:10,529
and and aerospace industry and so it's

420
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,318
meant for big heavy things that are

421
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:15,990
dirty and that's kind of what plants and

422
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,599
pots are as well so very talented

423
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,159
research scientist keeps dunkin running

424
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,230
this this is what it looks like on the

425
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,818
inside so I've got a little schematic of

426
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,860
how it works but that's the source of

427
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:27,750
the detector that's the sample and this

428
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,639
thinkin's dinner spin around kind of

429
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,589
like the optical system you can also see

430
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,930
a lot of mechanics so we can do very

431
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,639
large samples so again quickly how it

432
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:38,399
works there's a source and a detector

433
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,350
and this sits on a very less something

434
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,539
with light density and as we shoot

435
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,490
x-rays through we get a contrast image

436
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,629
so the denser the material the more

437
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,308
tubes orbs the x-ray and that that

438
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:52,409
generates our difference in contrast the

439
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:54,120
cassava a pot with cassava root system

440
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:56,039
doesn't look like much but there's more

441
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,289
magic that happened so we basically

442
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,469
collect lots of these as we spin around

443
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:02,639
and then we can develop a

444
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,019
three-dimensional reconstruction and

445
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,380
I'll show you a whole litany of these in

446
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,568
a little while but as other features of

447
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,850
the system after we've spun around we

448
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:13,288
can actually because of the mechanics in

449
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,480
here we can actually move the source and

450
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:16,548
detector up and scan

451
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,199
across the whole plant and obviously

452
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:21,470
this comes at a cost of data and time

453
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,360
that we can do it about four feet and we

454
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,699
can also do what's called a mosaics

455
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,438
which is a tiling scan we can scan

456
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,150
across and so we can do very wide thing

457
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,360
so we have about a two by two by four

458
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,850
foot imaging volume and the voxel

459
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:38,269
resolution on that would be about 150 to

460
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:40,189
200 microns a nice thing about the

461
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:42,379
system is we can also zoom in so this is

462
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,630
a corn example of a corn kernel if we

463
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,309
zoom in and there's a software called

464
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,200
sub pix which gives us a little bit more

465
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:51,139
resolution we can get to about the five

466
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,120
to ten micron voxel size so it's a very

467
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,490
versatile instrument and just as a

468
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,409
real-life example of this this is a corn

469
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,019
cob we can scan and that's a kernel that

470
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,080
came off of it and so we can measure

471
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:04,279
lots of stuff within this corn cob and I

472
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,439
don't know if you can see this but also

473
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,879
there's a little maize embryo I think

474
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,429
we're close to being able to count the

475
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,440
number of leaves things like that

476
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,679
endosperm it's a lot of information this

477
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,630
that we then have to extract using

478
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,790
computation getting back to the roots

479
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,080
which is really the the why we've got

480
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:23,450
the system in the first place

481
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,639
to look you know at the hidden half of

482
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,039
plants so this is a corn plant grown in

483
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,020
a sort of a expanded clay what you're

484
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,149
looking at is just a slice turned like

485
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,039
this and as the movie goes you can see

486
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,110
the stem and you can see the crown roots

487
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,970
here nice and round as the movie goes

488
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:39,439
maybe you can track these but after a

489
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,669
little while once it start to get small

490
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,950
you're probably having a hard time

491
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,890
tracking those so this is really the

492
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,298
magic because what we have to do is

493
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,570
extract these roots back out of the

494
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:53,029
reconstruction so this is where

495
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:56,480
rotational tation is just a general term

496
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,859
for telling a teaching computer what's

497
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,110
foreground and what's background which

498
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:02,359
objects of interest and what's not so

499
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:05,269
that you can then measure your objects

500
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,949
so again me is working here on automated

501
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,058
or semi-automated methods for tracking

502
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,980
their roots and if you look carefully

503
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:11,808
there's roots that are missed there's

504
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,390
some things in here that are not so in

505
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:16,460
the end we get a reconstruction in it

506
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,660
it's pretty good I mean there's a lot of

507
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,480
missing roots and there's some stuff

508
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,250
that's not roots but we're getting there

509
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,970
this is an active area of research in my

510
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,500
group and just

511
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,870
in general in the field of imaging

512
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:31,159
sometimes segmentation is easy often

513
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:32,808
it's quite hard as mike showed some

514
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,730
examples of there's there's certainly a

515
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:37,129
lot of applications for machine learning

516
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,558
and nai em is pattern recognition so

517
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,510
here's an example again the

518
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,509
collaboration with bailant it didn't do

519
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:46,158
such a great job this is a soybean and

520
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,808
you should be looking at you know these

521
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,549
things we're looking for nodules those

522
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,829
are definitely not nodules or that the

523
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:54,440
world's biggest nodule you can actually

524
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:56,658
see them if you look carefully here but

525
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,940
the point is we're kind of getting there

526
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,610
but we're not quite there yet but you

527
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,400
know again as Mike mentioned if you have

528
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:07,250
very talented students in the lab or

529
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,750
studious and focus and methodical you

530
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,000
can clean these up with manual

531
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,558
segmentation so now this looks much more

532
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,900
like a soybean root and again we can

533
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,329
measure the litany of univariate rates

534
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,159
and we can also now identify the nodules

535
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,928
count the nodules how big are the

536
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,909
nodules how are these changing over time

537
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,880
we can now capture that in that

538
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:27,260
information okay so that's that's the

539
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,490
work we're doing there there's again I'm

540
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,379
just going to kind of go through stuff

541
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,000
since it was this was a tech forward

542
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,010
kind of meeting just to give you some

543
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,048
examples what we can see so not just

544
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,970
roots as the cassava root system these

545
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,558
are the storage roots and the fine roots

546
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,750
but not just the external morphology

547
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,399
also the internal morphology so this

548
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,079
actually is a little slice of the stem

549
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,000
it's just to show you that there's a lot

550
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,589
of information here for example these

551
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,349
are roots that are about to emerge

552
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:53,389
through the stem there's a vascular

553
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:55,908
tissue things like this we think we can

554
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,650
possibly use this in disease progression

555
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:00,799
for example to study

556
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,840
cassava brown streak virus as it starts

557
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,779
to develop inside of a tuber so that's

558
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,089
sort of an ongoing side project in the

559
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:09,950
group but the idea is not we can't it's

560
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:11,990
not only that we can see outside of the

561
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,850
plant but also inside so here's another

562
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,558
example this is a maize stalk these are

563
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:17,899
the crown roots and one emerges with

564
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,119
each leaf so we can actually see inside

565
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,269
the vascular connections between root

566
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:25,038
and across the leaves here in the maize

567
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,720
plant so again there's nothing

568
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,019
quantitative about this this now

569
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,269
requires some person or people to come

570
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,410
in and actually extract features from

571
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:37,319
this but the information is certain

572
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,790
there and so x-rays can can do a lot

573
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,500
here's something that's a little bit

574
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:42,599
easier to see this is a developing

575
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,940
castle and a maize plant so when we

576
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,469
think about flowering time and and and

577
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,940
environmental effects that affects

578
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,680
flowering we often think about it well

579
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,650
when the tassel pops out but actually

580
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,210
the primordia right when it's only even

581
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,940
smaller than this a few cells big is

582
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,740
more like the v4 v5 stage right it's

583
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,450
inside the stem and it's been growing

584
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,819
there for a long time so it may be that

585
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,620
the relevant time point we want to

586
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,689
understand the environment is way back

587
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,189
in time but you can see just from this I

588
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,230
can predict how many leaves that are

589
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,910
going to be on the plant before the

590
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,259
tassel emerges for example that's sort

591
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,930
of an obvious thing I could probably

592
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,309
count that by hand and so this is an

593
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,570
example of what it looks like a little

594
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:20,549
bit older so now we can see the

595
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:24,689
individual florets we can measure those

596
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:27,149
traits etc here's an example just for

597
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,920
mutant analysis right so this might be

598
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,450
an architecture that's kind of hard to

599
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,720
capture like how would you how would you

600
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,400
measure it by hand and Blake wasn't sure

601
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,230
about this but we we can capture it

602
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,780
inside of the stem as it's developing

603
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,400
and again use these computation to

604
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,379
measure how that's different from

605
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Michael wild-type here's another example

606
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,680
in Soteria in fluorescence of just so

607
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,269
here's a mutant and here's the wild-type

608
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,130
so that gives you an idea of some of the

609
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,779
stuff we can do getting back to two

610
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,170
roots before I run out of time

611
00:22:54,779 --> 00:23:00,180
completely one thing that we're doing is

612
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,180
trying to extract more information out

613
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,070
of the three-dimensional architecture so

614
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,600
I told you about dirt that's really 2d

615
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:08,669
so we're trying to extract information

616
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,609
from something we've flattened down into

617
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,800
2d we can scan these in about two or

618
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,449
three minutes depending on how big it is

619
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,940
and what resolutions we've been doing

620
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,799
this by the hundreds so now if you

621
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,539
wanted if I want to quantify the

622
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,470
differences between these two I can use

623
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,690
dirt but I can also use

624
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,730
three-dimensional data so here's what a

625
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,650
three dimensional it's very complex and

626
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,269
we're working with some topologists and

627
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,470
computer graphics people to clean these

628
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:34,319
up because there's actually a lot of

629
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,669
loops and noise but nonetheless we can

630
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,308
capture a lot of information from this

631
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,859
so I won't go through this experiment

632
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:43,358
but just to say that we basically took

633
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:46,749
the NAMM founders which sort of

634
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:48,249
encompass maize genetic diversity we

635
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:49,389
planted these out in our field in

636
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:51,970
Columbia Missouri

637
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:53,648
last year and we dug every week the

638
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,839
roots up so we have a time series sort

639
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:57,608
of a manual time series but a subset of

640
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,368
these at weeks four seven and tasseling

641
00:23:57,608 --> 00:24:02,918
we also scan so it's about 250 plants

642
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:05,528
I'm not showing you 250 only three that

643
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,359
we've analyzed so far so at a sling is

644
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:10,239
the principal component analysis just to

645
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:11,678
show you the 2d dirt traits all the

646
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:14,499
things we can measure with that 2d

647
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,269
software principal component one does a

648
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:20,079
pretty good job of separating Kentucky

649
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:22,118
21 these dots from b73 Missouri 17 but

650
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,730
it can't really separate B 73 in

651
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:26,769
Missouri 17 when we take the x-ray data

652
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,759
into account all of a sudden we can now

653
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:32,558
cluster be 73 KY 21 in Missouri 17 much

654
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,329
better so I think that's because the

655
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,788
information contents higher it's

656
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:38,470
allowing us to separate these things

657
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:40,808
discriminatory power is really what

658
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,429
matters to us most and if we really want

659
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:44,168
to we can go back and look at the trait

660
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:47,350
loadings and we can see that solidity

661
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:49,330
for example is driving this and that and

662
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:51,608
we can actually quantify each of the

663
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:53,199
individual univariate traits as well so

664
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:57,428
we can get back to the biological

665
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,679
insight if we if we want to but really

666
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,960
what matters is discriminatory power so

667
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,239
each of these individual traits don't

668
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,119
mean that much to me personally it's

669
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:08,619
just the ability to separate and I think

670
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:11,980
that will increase our ability to

671
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:13,658
identify genes so in the final bit of

672
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,849
time there's a section I won't get to

673
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:18,570
but just going back to this pet this is

674
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:21,009
sort of a really interesting technology

675
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:23,589
again you're looking at carbon moving so

676
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:25,509
we feed this plan radioactive carbon 11

677
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,970
so short-lived radioisotope very

678
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,460
energetic and it's just fed it takes it

679
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,649
in confettis emphasis and starts moving

680
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,179
it down that's an imaging artifact so

681
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:36,398
you're looking at real time at the

682
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:37,450
carbon moving down the reason this is so

683
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:39,118
interesting is because now we're

684
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,200
actually looking at physiological

685
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:42,548
dynamics we're looking at what's

686
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,069
happening inside the plant that's

687
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:47,499
driving growth and we're able to overlay

688
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:48,710
that it's multimodal imaging with what's

689
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:50,329
actually

690
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,490
with the morphology of the plan and how

691
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:55,460
it's changing so you saw this that's

692
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:59,569
that's Ty's plant pet system and now we

693
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,700
can look at not only carbon allocation

694
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:03,288
and plant growth decisions over time as

695
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,450
a function of development so early on

696
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:07,308
there's no carbon going to the roots and

697
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,319
later we see that develop these are

698
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:11,839
three maize plants or subjects as

699
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,999
they're called at the med school we can

700
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,648
also look at this dynamically in real

701
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:17,569
time so just we have about two and a

702
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:18,168
half hour window with carbon 11 I should

703
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:20,359
mention

704
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,889
Margaret Frank who's about to start a

705
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,808
faculty position here has done a lot of

706
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:26,089
work with nitrogen there's a plenty of

707
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:27,408
other Radio isotopes you can use as

708
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:29,839
trace there's carbon just a really easy

709
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,940
one it's a gas plant takes it up and and

710
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,378
you can see it but so here's I don't

711
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,360
have much more time but here's a quick

712
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:38,058
example again if some biological insight

713
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,490
so this is the optical gel system you

714
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:42,859
this is a very young plant we're only

715
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,899
one leaf has emerged and so you can see

716
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,668
there's no carbon here in the roots you

717
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:48,349
see it in the chute here these are

718
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:51,559
different bed times where the shoots not

719
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:53,509
being shown the only carbon going to a

720
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:55,788
root at this stage is this crown root

721
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:58,190
here so it's a chute derived rudy you

722
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,720
can see a little spot there the next day

723
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,538
when the next leaf emerged all of a

724
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,960
sudden the the dam broke the plumbing

725
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:08,359
change the the seed ceases to be the

726
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,179
source of energy for the roots and now

727
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,939
the roots are growing being fed from

728
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:15,320
from the the leaves and the Photosynth

729
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,110
photosynthesis so this is an interesting

730
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:20,058
biological insight I think we can

731
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:22,428
capture with with this it would have

732
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:24,499
been hard to do otherwise so ultimately

733
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:28,850
we're using optical methods but now that

734
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:31,129
we have the x-ray x-ray CT x-ray pet PET

735
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:33,048
CT is actually where we're moving next

736
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:35,778
but the optical methods allow us to

737
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:37,970
overlay these two and actually ask for a

738
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:39,349
given amount of carbon at a root sip how

739
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,240
much of that root growth later so this

740
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:44,028
is something we're modeling and we can

741
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,440
see changes for example the jar we have

742
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,819
to use is kind of small so when the

743
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,259
roots hit the side of the jar we can

744
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:50,628
actually see a difference in the

745
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:53,028
relationship of growth to carbon

746
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:55,099
allocated so actual plant environment

747
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:57,440
interactions in real time so if we

748
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:59,089
wanted to example for example to query

749
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,789
the transcriptome or the metabolomic

750
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,709
series

751
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:04,200
if we wait till the roots have already

752
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,819
grown we've missed the dynamic event the

753
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,950
dynamic event that triggered the growth

754
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,289
was driving it happened before and

755
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,610
that's what we want to capture so I

756
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,609
won't have time to explain a

757
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:16,619
mathematical technique that we're using

758
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,329
similarly but I'll show you some cool

759
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,939
grey practices so we can use this

760
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,619
mathematical method to capture

761
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,960
comprehensive phenotypes this is from

762
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:27,199
the USDA collection so Jason Wanda who's

763
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,549
USDA and also here at Cornell it

764
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,440
represents grape genetic diversity and

765
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:34,409
just to show you with this mathematical

766
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,140
method we can actually discriminate

767
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,300
different grape breakers architectures

768
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,480
very well we're hoping to use this now

769
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:45,419
for route and shoot whole plants

770
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,190
architectures so you can read we have a

771
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,740
preprint here in viral archives work

772
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,450
we've done in tomato also a really nice

773
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,160
essay in American Journal botany if you

774
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,110
want to know more about mathematical

775
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,540
approaches to once we have the data to

776
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:00,000
actually capturing information in a

777
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:04,109
comprehensive rather than ad-hoc and

778
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,009
discrete way so I'll stop there is my

779
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:10,289
group at the Danforth center several

780
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:13,069
funders including the NSF USDA and

781
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:15,779
valent Biosciences and if there's time

782
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:22,220
happy to take questions thank

783
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:25,798
[Applause]

784
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,048
be detected your room Hockley both in

785
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,599
the jail and to shuttle only and what

786
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:32,190
other correlations yeah so I skipped

787
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,740
over that slide that the plant Genome

788
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,778
Project were explicitly doing that and

789
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,870
we're not finished yet but instead of

790
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:42,269
correlating a trait we can get from a

791
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:43,739
gel which is very high resolution and

792
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:45,298
what we can get is a field which is sort

793
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,569
of low resolution we're just comparing

794
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:52,168
at the genetic level so do we find snips

795
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:54,240
or QTL in common from gel from the field

796
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:55,950
and not only are we doing the shovel

797
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,019
omics or the superficial roots but

798
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,909
actually many Raisa Tron imaging that's

799
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:03,599
what Andrew leekie is doing so are there

800
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:05,130
any genetic signals in common which i

801
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,500
think is much more solid ground than

802
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,500
traits which vary depending on how you

803
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,849
measure them for example so thanks yeah

804
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,849
okay thank you
