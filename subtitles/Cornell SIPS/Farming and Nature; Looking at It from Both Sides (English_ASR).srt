1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,860
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,859
University

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,049
so I'm just going to do go through a

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,269
little bit this is the the structure

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,160
i'll give you a little bit of background

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:19,410
talk about farm escape ecology the two

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,589
way what is what if farms provide for

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,579
nature witness nature provide for farms

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:26,278
connecting people to the ecology of

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:29,549
their landscape understanding the people

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,349
side and then very briefly outline a

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,609
study that we're thinking of trying to

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,980
do so this is who we are I'm sorry this

14
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:40,799
is because everybody's this is I guess a

15
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,808
bit low for people but this is a we work

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,339
at Hawthorne Valley Farm which is in

17
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,518
Columbia County which is the New York

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,879
County which is on basically the border

19
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:52,799
with Massachusetts and it's a biodynamic

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,530
farm about two hours north of New York

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,178
City this is our regular staff you know

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,859
here's the here's the center of

23
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,370
operations and then the rest of us kind

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,290
of come along for the ride but just to

25
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,759
give you a little bit idea who we are so

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,790
that you can understand what we can or

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,420
can't do my wife is a botanist to plant

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,580
ecologist ana is actually an

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,740
anthropologist so she works with us with

30
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,739
the people part of things Kyle who's

31
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,119
here but in the insect collection today

32
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,829
is our technician but he's been working

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,760
a lot with ants and the patterns in the

34
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,469
landscape our son is the really into

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,230
dragonflies so he's a lot faster it has

36
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:34,289
a lot better eyes than I do our dog is

37
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,620
always with us and then I tend to

38
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,900
shuffle papers but if I can which makes

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,310
me more happy I'm actually a wildlife

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,570
ecologist as Emily said so just a little

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,730
bit of background Hawthorne Valley Farm

42
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,009
I'm not going to go into a whole lot of

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,390
detail about what biodynamic farming is

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,240
partially because I'm not all that

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,909
experienced in it but in terms of why

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,709
it's relevant or works with us a form of

47
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,739
organic farming that views the farm as

48
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,269
an individuality closely tied to its

49
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,129
social and ecological surroundings and

50
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,949
ideally largely self-sufficient in terms

51
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,929
of its nutrient flows so it is part of

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,979
that philosophy is what I'd say

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,750
ecological and so we fit into that they

54
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,369
tend to be diverse they tend to connect

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,210
with the community so the work a lot of

56
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,520
our work is connecting with the

57
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,480
community the people in the area which

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,520
fits into this philosophy so what we do

59
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,829
as a program farm scape ecology program

60
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,360
is try to encourage informed compassion

61
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,520
for our local working landscape its

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,710
people and other life and we work with

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,140
research and we work with outreach to

64
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,719
try to do that and it's really trying to

65
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,819
get enthusiasm trying to help people be

66
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,340
curious about their landscape and help

67
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,439
inform them at the same time we do try

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,479
to do original research but we're not in

69
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,180
an academic setting so our audience is

70
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,679
not really our scientific peers but it's

71
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,689
the people in the county the farmers we

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,240
interact with the general public so that

73
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:03,889
affects you know how we do our work for

74
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:06,680
better or worse so getting them to the

75
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:09,079
heart of what we try to do farm escape

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,840
ecology I think we try to think about it

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,900
in two ways we try to think about what

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,849
can farming potentially provide to

79
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,710
nature conservation in our landscape I'm

80
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,259
not talking I don't know the global

81
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:24,140
situation and then also the reverse what

82
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:28,549
can farm what can nature potentially do

83
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:32,569
for farming so it makes sense so you

84
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,100
tend to have look at there's a tendency

85
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,189
to look at a landscape like this either

86
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,159
as being production a pasture the

87
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:42,530
gardens of pasture etcetera or from the

88
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,229
perspective of nature conservation but

89
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,180
of course it's really a combined

90
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:49,489
landscape and that's what we try to

91
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,439
emphasize both in our research and as we

92
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,460
interact with people how does that all

93
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:58,280
go together one of the things that we've

94
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,620
found helpful in trying to communicate

95
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,250
with farmers and other people about what

96
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,610
can farming provide to nature is an idea

97
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,840
that builds on this and so this is what

98
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,650
Hawthorne value could be anyplace really

99
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,330
look like say 14 year 1400 you lots of

100
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,129
forests there might have been some

101
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,009
native agriculture there were probably a

102
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:21,620
lot more beaver this hillside probably

103
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:24,649
burned grip yeah not every year but

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,639
regularly may have looked something like

105
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:29,379
that and you had certain organisms

106
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,709
existing in that land

107
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:35,230
and then that landscape evolved over

108
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:38,079
time and you had this is maybe what look

109
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:41,200
like in 1870 same landscape this is the

110
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,490
same section but based on aerial

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,289
photographs and other historical

112
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,990
evidence this is sort of what it looked

113
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,660
like it its most open state and then

114
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,110
today and that would be what the

115
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,260
landscape looks like and then today I'm

116
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,370
jumping ahead you had various organisms

117
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,920
existing in there and then today it

118
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,840
looks more like this and so the question

119
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,259
becomes this is today's landscape you

120
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:08,349
got more roads Forest has come back you

121
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,779
have still have some fields and our

122
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,870
question is okay those native organisms

123
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,089
that existed in this landscape or

124
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,019
perhaps in this landscape where do they

125
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:23,019
find space in today's landscape and the

126
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:25,180
way that we try to think of that are

127
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,879
through analogies now I imagine this is

128
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,860
probably actually a simile but i'll say

129
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,459
technology but any we try to think of it

130
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,770
ecological analogies and what we mean by

131
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,289
an ecological analogy is it refers to a

132
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,120
human-shaped habitat which well not the

133
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,310
ones that the given organism co-evolved

134
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,079
with offer enough similarities or

135
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,800
analogies to be ecologically functional

136
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,449
for that species so an example is you

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,670
know this is what it looked this is what

138
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,430
a forest looks like after his burn you

139
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:58,000
have the shrub this brush coming up well

140
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,040
this is a lightly grazed pasture that

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,990
also has a lot of brush in it it's not

142
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,150
the same thing and I'm not trying to

143
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,850
claim it is but there are certain

144
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:11,979
species that occurred here for which

145
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,740
this analogy works this is another

146
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,439
example this is a beaver pond and this

147
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,000
is a cow pond again they're not the same

148
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,469
thing and there's certainly things in

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,480
here that are not in here but for

150
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,310
example some of the dragonflies that

151
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,710
like these edges that are like that

152
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,230
they'll be there and they'll be here so

153
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:31,599
we say this works as an analogy just for

154
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,540
that those species of dragonflies for

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,680
this and so dads come back to that

156
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,990
question where do they find a home they

157
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,370
answer as well where they find workable

158
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,939
and

159
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,750
and so what our challenge is you know

160
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:54,449
how can farming encourage such analogies

161
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:56,759
does that make sense so a lot of what we

162
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,919
do is try to work with farmers to help

163
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,079
them understand the history and the

164
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,668
ecology of their landscape from the

165
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,379
perspective of understanding those that

166
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:06,599
story and those analogies and this is

167
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,159
just this is some work we did for

168
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,650
Roxbury farm how many of you know

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,030
Roxbury farm I think you could be at a

170
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,099
seminar today where you actually hear

171
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,209
Jean Paul from Roxbury talking but if

172
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,300
you came here you're not going to hear

173
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:20,129
but we do ecological maps and then we

174
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,189
try to think of each of these habitats

175
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,990
and we try to imagine you know what

176
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,310
could they what might be analogies be

177
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,960
and how could those be encouraged this

178
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,379
is the same as a big farm this another

179
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:35,819
map this is Hawthorne Valley the same

180
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:37,529
idea a habitat map for a farm and then

181
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,149
don't worry about the small print but

182
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,369
this is the type of information that we

183
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,929
would give them we have that habitat map

184
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,410
and then for each of that hat those

185
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,360
habitats we talked about location nature

186
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,150
conservation value how it might interact

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,229
with agricultural production and

188
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,848
suggestions for management but we're not

189
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:56,250
prescriptive I mean the farmers know a

190
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,569
lot better than we know how that land

191
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,519
should be farmed so these are just ideas

192
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:02,129
it's just sore we're sharing our ideas

193
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,719
for a better or worse is this camera on

194
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,219
because I keep feeling I must be getting

195
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,770
my ear filmed or something as I'm

196
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,690
standing don't worry about okay so I'm

197
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,939
just going to run through some of these

198
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,519
habitats so that you get a little bit of

199
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,439
an idea of how we're thinking about this

200
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,389
so mature hay fields were the ecological

201
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,759
analogies who are the species of

202
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,860
conservation interest well for some

203
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,069
species the analogy might be between

204
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,820
prairies and hay fields now this works

205
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,379
as a structural analogy for these

206
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,360
grassland nesting birds I mean I think

207
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:40,229
they're fairly that's a fairly common

208
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,750
example that's brought up and in our

209
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,839
county now this is this is the

210
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,879
trajectory of open area in our county so

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,280
those those birds have certainly gone

212
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,230
through a real decline in inhabitat

213
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,278
availability since the 1880s but there

214
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,639
was not all that much

215
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,049
but one of the things that you bring

216
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,909
into the question when you're thinking

217
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:02,128
about those specific what makes that

218
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:05,370
work as a habitat for grassland birds is

219
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:07,528
well when does hanging happened relative

220
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,808
to when the young birds get out of the

221
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:11,039
nest so if you're hating it before the

222
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:13,198
birds are out of the nest then it

223
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,990
doesn't work as an analogy that makes

224
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:18,359
sense and this is just at some

225
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,839
historical work we did looking at date

226
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,980
of haying today that's the black space

227
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,089
behind this versus various historical

228
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,659
data we have from the county and the

229
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:33,059
point is paying is occurring much is

230
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,558
occurring earlier in general than it

231
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:37,019
occurred historically which makes that

232
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:40,469
analogy less viable for some of the

233
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,870
grassland birds because they fledge sort

234
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,389
of in here so if most of the hanging for

235
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,528
example the Shakers we're doing most of

236
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:52,589
their hang after the middle of june

237
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:53,999
beginning of july wires today a lot of

238
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,410
it's happening before that and that

239
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:59,579
makes it more difficult for those birds

240
00:09:55,409 --> 00:10:01,438
to get there they're young off it

241
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:03,149
doesn't work and this is important when

242
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:05,639
you think about analogies it's not it's

243
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,470
you're not reconstructing Prairie it

244
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,448
that analogy doesn't work for

245
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,829
butterflies and the reason it doesn't

246
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:13,229
work for butterflies is there much more

247
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:15,870
botanically picky the caterpillar is a

248
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,430
butterfly's need to find like a monarch

249
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,709
you know goes out after the milkweed

250
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,938
they have to find the particular plants

251
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:24,388
they're looking for which aren't going

252
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:26,099
to be in a hay field so it doesn't work

253
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:29,519
that same analogy doesn't work so well

254
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,230
for butterflies old fields and poor

255
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,980
Meadows this is another habitat you find

256
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,928
on farms maybe the analogy is we do have

257
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,569
grasslands in our area that are hilltop

258
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:41,458
rocky grasslands some native grasses up

259
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:43,110
here there are organisms historically

260
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,838
that survived there may be some of those

261
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,300
actually come down into these old fields

262
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,079
and this is some work that my wife did

263
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:54,990
looking at the Botanical diversity of

264
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:58,019
pastures hay fields intensive pastures

265
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,058
dryer Hill pastures showing that you

266
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,278
know a great purport there are more

267
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:04,059
species in these dry health hillsides

268
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,669
plus more of them are

269
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,839
native so as a sort of a place where

270
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,599
you're going to have conservation of

271
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,080
native plant species these dry hillsides

272
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,360
are quite interesting in part perhaps

273
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,129
because there were sources in the

274
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,029
landscape that had species already

275
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:23,649
adapted those kinds of environments and

276
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:25,720
the great thing is it does work I like

277
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,870
butterflies so you got to bear with me

278
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,700
it does work for these butterflies

279
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,560
because you do have those native plants

280
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,150
there they're caterpillars can feed on

281
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:39,339
them so the analogy works for them

282
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:41,529
shrubby fields I talked and this this

283
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,040
slide should still be familiar this is

284
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:47,709
the one with the burn over and the post

285
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,469
cow shrubland that's one of the

286
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,840
analogies you might have who do you find

287
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,580
there well how many of you know the

288
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,750
eastern caught that sorry the New

289
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,360
England Cottontail have you heard about

290
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,070
that a New England Cottontail is

291
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,950
actually being considered for endangered

292
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,210
species status it's Silva lagus so it's

293
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,360
the same species as the eastern

294
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,280
cottontail but it's one that has

295
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,470
essentially used to be the only con tail

296
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,899
east of the Hudson shrubland species

297
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,000
it's declined dramatically and one of

298
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,559
the areas is are these shrublands so

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,379
that's one of the species you could put

300
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:23,859
potentially find in such an area

301
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:25,179
shrubland birds are also important that

302
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,590
many of them have been declining

303
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,289
dramatically so I'm just giving you a

304
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,639
quick kind of rundown don't worry about

305
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:32,740
the details but just giving you a little

306
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,179
bit of an overview for what some of

307
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,560
these different habitats might offer

308
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:40,829
potentially can offer one of the other

309
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,529
habitats that we've been looking at is

310
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:47,139
the old farm woodlot and its role as

311
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:50,669
being actually ancient farm as ancient

312
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:53,649
forest and when I talk about ancient I

313
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:55,809
mean force that has long been in forest

314
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:58,449
although extensive logging or other uses

315
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:01,269
may have occurred so the idea is a

316
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,250
primary forest is obviously one that

317
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:06,490
sort of basically never been almost

318
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,789
never been touched right whereas an

319
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,740
ancient force the idea is it's been in

320
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,559
forest for a long time although many of

321
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,389
those trees may not be particularly old

322
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,069
that makes sense so primary forest is

323
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,459
ancient but not all ancient forests are

324
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,379
primary and the interesting thing when

325
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,719
you look at the history of the landscape

326
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,189
so this is the 1940s that's the earliest

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
aerial photographs we have for our

328
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,019
region you see lots of farmland but you

329
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,578
see some of these areas that were left

330
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,679
in forest partially because they're

331
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:40,250
rocky but partially because all four

332
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:43,458
arms needed a woodlot for building barns

333
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,230
for wood or that sort of thing now today

334
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:48,619
yeah it just all looks like the same

335
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,940
thing however for us like this have some

336
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,100
special things because they were never

337
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,540
taken out of four as well you know never

338
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,129
in the past 10,000 years this is just an

339
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,078
example we were working in a farmland

340
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:03,289
setting this is another habitat map and

341
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:05,958
these dark areas here are plots that

342
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:08,629
we've realized were probably some of

343
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,338
these ancient forests one of the ways we

344
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,019
did that we were doing soil samples and

345
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,209
so we were looking at the depth of the

346
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:16,730
organic layer because when you plow

347
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,649
something that gets all mixed up and you

348
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,870
can't you don't have that deep organic

349
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:24,759
layer so we can use soils to help us

350
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,110
find which areas are ancient forest and

351
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,078
when you go into an ancient forest like

352
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,289
this you find a variety of old trees old

353
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,759
treo shrubs it's now none of these are

354
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,490
particularly big trees because logging

355
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,629
has occurred but the soil conditions are

356
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,269
such that you get something like

357
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:46,689
rattlesnake plantain does anybody know

358
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:49,060
rattlesnake plantain here great part

359
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,500
I think that sounds right my wife's to

360
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:54,429
the botanist so I'll take your word for

361
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,379
it but that could well be that's it's an

362
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,879
orchid we almost never sought and then

363
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,129
also we were walking through these old

364
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,529
farms these ancient forest plots and

365
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:05,950
there it was so there's some special

366
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:08,110
things going on in there we did some

367
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,660
studies with floodplain foresees to the

368
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,840
forests along creeks and we looked at

369
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:16,569
ancient versus not ancient forests and

370
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,430
what you find we categorize those

371
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,650
forests into different forest types and

372
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:24,129
then in this case we were comparing

373
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,929
cover by invasive shrubs and we found

374
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:28,210
that you know indeed the more recent for

375
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:30,250
us not surprising are the ones that had

376
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,519
the highest amount of invasive shrubs in

377
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,809
them whereas the older ones they hadn't

378
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,929
one of the interesting things to think

379
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,369
about is you picture you nice a shrub

380
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,099
when I say floodplain forest can you

381
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,250
picture this it's the areas along the

382
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,110
streams that regularly maybe once or

383
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,340
twice a year get flooded they're really

384
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:54,070
disturbed areas and if all that forest

385
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,440
is taken off then you have this great

386
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,600
inoculation of invasive species coming

387
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,910
down the creek and going in and being

388
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,920
able to set up there so if in the past

389
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:05,350
50 years you cleaned it up completely

390
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:08,049
then you have this big inoculation if

391
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,240
that's been in forest then those those

392
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:14,259
invasive species are much less able to

393
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,060
establish themselves and basically you

394
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,090
also see a higher diversity of native

395
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:22,659
species I won't go into that you have

396
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:25,740
meadows and ponds so that was a wet

397
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:28,839
meadow on a farm this is a farm pond

398
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,629
analogy as we mentioned before might be

399
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,850
a beaver pond and one of the interesting

400
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:36,730
things to think about is that you know

401
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,820
Bieber have this huge impact on the

402
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,220
ecology of our landscape and there were

403
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,839
a lot of beaver like in the 1500s and

404
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,820
this is what this is is an estimate of

405
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,120
the amount of pond surface area in

406
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,160
Columbia County versus year and what you

407
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,860
see is that there was probably a huge

408
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,829
drop-off in the amount of pawn because

409
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,950
the beaver were all trapped out prefer

410
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,139
around 1607

411
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:03,650
then you started to get mill ponds and

412
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:05,869
now just now with all this I know if you

413
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,990
have it here or not you have a sort of

414
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:11,419
fashion for ponds in this area and new

415
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,940
houses yeah okay so that's that's sort

416
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,800
of what what this accounts for but the

417
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,529
thing is they're not the same

418
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,750
ecologically and so we did some work

419
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:25,099
with with ponds both on farms and off

420
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,869
pond's off pond's off farms so what this

421
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,849
is an index we looked at plants we

422
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,549
looked at various animals so this is

423
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:33,799
just an index of overall diversity this

424
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,619
is the surrounding land use agricultural

425
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:40,009
residential mixed or neither and this

426
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:42,079
was about 95 ponds that we looked at and

427
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:44,089
what you see is that the agricultural

428
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,240
ponds actually were more diverse than

429
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:48,949
the residential ponds which you might if

430
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,630
you think about the typical residential

431
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,950
pond you know you might understand this

432
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,980
because most of them are many of them

433
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,380
are mowed around people want to keep

434
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,559
them crystal clear and that's not what

435
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,480
life wants to do and some of these now

436
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,460
these aren't loafing ponds in the middle

437
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,339
of a farmyard but these are might be

438
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,990
pawns and grazed areas these are much

439
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:14,179
more loosely managed and so they're more

440
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:15,890
tippers makes sense another analogy

441
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,120
might be vernal pools and we actually do

442
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,550
find some of these vernal pool

443
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:23,179
amphibians in those farm ponds that

444
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:26,089
don't have a lot of fish in them wet

445
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:29,660
meadows again are quite diverse areas

446
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:31,639
have quite a few native species a place

447
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,990
that probably again probably a lot of

448
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,180
native species relatively speaking

449
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,480
because they were part of the natural

450
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,460
landscape and these are just some pretty

451
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,559
flowers these are wet meadow flowers

452
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,670
some of our this is a beautiful flower

453
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,970
if you know this Cardinal flower

454
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,620
and sorry gotta gotta bring in some

455
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,860
butterflies one of my favorite

456
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,939
butterflies a bronze copper and

457
00:18:52,859 --> 00:19:00,459
Baltimore checker spot with its food

458
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:04,210
plant turtle head okay what does nature

459
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,440
provide to farming I think there's some

460
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,019
of you who know much more about this

461
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,269
than I do but we have started to try to

462
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:12,339
look at it in part because as we were

463
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:13,809
working with farmers you know that's

464
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:15,819
that's a very much a question that's

465
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,129
important to them yes they're interested

466
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:19,419
in ecology but of course what can it do

467
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,400
for them and production wise and it's

468
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,610
not an either/or but it's how do you

469
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,519
also respect their perspective and help

470
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:28,959
them try to understand this aspect

471
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:33,220
anybody have questions about that part

472
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,799
that I just went through some of you

473
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,940
actually still awake so that's good um

474
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:42,279
okay ecological services so I sort of

475
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,809
laugh I always feel a little bit

476
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:45,129
hesitant saying services because it's

477
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,319
kind of like saying that my wife gives

478
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,450
me marital services or something like

479
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,480
that which I or that I give her husband

480
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,039
services in the sense that I think

481
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,069
there's a you know there's more to it

482
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:00,159
than just the just the nitty-gritty of

483
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:02,649
the the monetary effects but it's one

484
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,000
way of looking at it and of course bees

485
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:08,140
are one of the very often talked about

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,390
providers of some of these ecological

487
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,950
services this was some work we did

488
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,750
actually a student working with us very

489
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,700
basic stuff you know what are the

490
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,470
different kinds of insects that come and

491
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,630
fertilize on some of the crop plants

492
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,279
well oh yes honey bee but maybe it's

493
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,350
only about a quarter and these other

494
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,700
ones many of these are native species

495
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:29,819
that are providing those pollination

496
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,350
services and this was again that that

497
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,929
generality this was looking at different

498
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:38,669
crops and presented a number of native

499
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:41,019
bee visits for some crops like cucumbers

500
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,970
mainly honeybees for pollinating those

501
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,980
but then for some other ones like the

502
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,670
wild the wild flowers would make sense

503
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,920
but maybe like broccoli raab or up here

504
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:54,039
the raspberries they were getting more

505
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,470
pollinated by the wild bees

506
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:58,869
and this builds into our consideration

507
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,430
of landscape because of something like

508
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,619
this now this is not our work this is

509
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,660
from Rufus Isaacs at Michigan State

510
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:06,639
University looking at bees that

511
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,800
pollinate blueberries but basically this

512
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,300
is the blueberry flowering period and

513
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,129
these are the flight periods of the

514
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:14,379
different pollinators and so the

515
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,790
question that this poses is okay great

516
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,860
you provide them with a blueberry crop

517
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:19,389
but how are they staying alive the rest

518
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,859
of the year you know you got to provide

519
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,320
something for them out here if you want

520
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:27,119
to have those native species around

521
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,859
pollinating your crops right makes sense

522
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,229
so we did a little bit related to that

523
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:34,389
we going back to that floodplain study i

524
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,640
showed you have any of you been in a

525
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:43,090
floodplain early in the spring say in

526
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:45,670
May what do you see wildflowers yeah you

527
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:49,720
know like bloodroot have you seen

528
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,759
bloodroot what's some other trout Lily

529
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,400
yeah definitely trout Lily blue cohosh

530
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,650
maybe something so it's before the trees

531
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,780
leaf out you have this big burst of

532
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:02,170
flowers so it's a great place for bees

533
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:04,990
and what we looked at was the bees on a

534
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,850
farm and an adjacent floodplain and what

535
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,549
we found was that you know about a

536
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:11,919
quarter of those species here were ones

537
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:13,359
we found in the spring on the floodplain

538
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,279
and then later in the year in the farm

539
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,740
fields so it just starts to give you

540
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,869
this picture of how the landscape is

541
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,460
supporting what's happening in those

542
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:25,569
crop fields some of those services this

543
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,299
is just you know another way of looking

544
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:30,250
at somebody's dude the amount of flowers

545
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,950
around a vegetable garden and the amount

546
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,369
of bees we see and not surprisingly more

547
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,890
flowers more bees except I didn't show

548
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:42,669
you this one this is the one that screws

549
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,990
up the statistics this observation up

550
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,090
here but what was interesting was when

551
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,150
we went back and looked at that that was

552
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:52,179
the farm these are 19 different farms in

553
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:56,130
the county this farm was the San deist

554
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:59,740
farm so how does that explain the result

555
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,740
ground nesting bees yeah so you have

556
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,529
bees really like to be able to some of

557
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,720
these individual bees nest

558
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:09,849
in sandy area so when you have sandy

559
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,069
soil it's just a much better habitat for

560
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:14,529
them so it adds yes flowers and food

561
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:18,099
sources are important but as every was

562
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:22,720
is well-recognized nesting sources are

563
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:24,609
too we've looked at spiders these are

564
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,589
just how many of you have you ever seen

565
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:28,000
jumping spiders they're really they're

566
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:30,250
fun spiders because there are the

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,599
spiders that look at you so you hold

568
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:36,250
them in your head and they follow you

569
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:37,659
around so they're really there is an orb

570
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,809
weaver you probably know these ones too

571
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,430
big our guy appears that you see in them

572
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:45,819
and a crab spider waiting for somebody

573
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,200
some unfortunate I didn't look up there

574
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,200
forgot the family this might be an am

575
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,440
Aruba but anyway we did a study this

576
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,319
this is our tropical fish slide which

577
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,450
has no no this is the this is actually

578
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,509
an aerial view of Hawthorne Valley Farm

579
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,340
main gardens and so this is where the

580
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,599
crops are this is a little bit of a

581
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,099
historical picture now because they've

582
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:07,449
changed the arrangement of the farm and

583
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:10,240
not so much of this is in crop but this

584
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,789
is crop and then these are surrounding

585
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,069
this is pastor this is a riparian area

586
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:16,990
this is these are wetlands here and what

587
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:20,379
we did was we just followed the insects

588
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:23,170
both in the center Pete part of the farm

589
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,470
and also in the surroundings or insects

590
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,820
and spiders a little bit this was an

591
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,829
initial work just to try to understand

592
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:31,869
how does that change what is the flow of

593
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:33,909
these invertebrates over the year and

594
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:37,719
the example here i'm going to show you

595
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,310
with spiders the white area is we just

596
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,200
didn't we couldn't study all of these we

597
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,809
didn't have the person power but the

598
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,309
darker the green the more abundant were

599
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,250
the spiders and so we're just going to

600
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:53,319
go through the year this is May that's

601
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:57,549
July June July july-september and then

602
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:59,980
september-october and the pattern I

603
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:03,309
think which is sort of summarized here

604
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,589
is that early in the year sort of the

605
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:08,139
wilder areas and the drive strips which

606
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:10,449
are the uncultivated areas they tended

607
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,090
to have the most spiders whereas by the

608
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,039
end of the year the crops and the crop

609
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:16,899
edges have the most spiders so you can

610
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,879
picture we have to know this better and

611
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,800
this is a little bit just adjust

612
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,990
Oh story but you can picture there's a

613
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,419
flow going on here perhaps the the

614
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,500
spiders earlier in the year coming into

615
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,630
these or central crop areas you know

616
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,430
wasps or another important provider this

617
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:38,650
is the this is the tomato hornworm well

618
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,720
well parasitized do you know what with

619
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,430
the wasps due to tomato hornworm have

620
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,950
you seen that so they they're actually a

621
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:47,259
control of the tomato hornworm but not

622
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,860
this wasp in particular but another much

623
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:52,480
smaller wasp and this was just you know

624
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:57,099
the relationship between the amount of

625
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,319
forest at each of these 19 different

626
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:01,209
farms and the amount of in this case

627
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,339
wingless wasps that we found in our

628
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,049
trapping and there is a significant

629
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:07,059
relationship the more the forest you

630
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:09,250
have the more of these wingless wasps

631
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,929
you have again very gross information

632
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,089
you'd have to look at more detail but

633
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:16,269
suggestive of a relationship between the

634
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:21,429
landscape and the amount of these

635
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:24,549
beneficials this is my other family I

636
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,840
this is I what I have a chance to work

637
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:29,049
with insects this is what I work with a

638
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,789
lot the ground beetles the crabbits an

639
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,639
interesting group some of which are I

640
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,990
have to confess summer pests but many of

641
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,910
them hopefully the majority of them are

642
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,789
actually beneficial there we they can be

643
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,850
both pest predators and weed seed

644
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,250
predators and we just start to look at

645
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:46,779
the patterns how do these how are these

646
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,940
communities of beetles distributed on

647
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:51,220
the landscape this was a study we did we

648
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,350
basically we looked at the beetles that

649
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,120
we found in the crops in this case we

650
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:56,799
were just looking at tomato in the

651
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,519
surrounding grassy areas and then then

652
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,839
in the forest and just ask the question

653
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,119
how these communities related you know

654
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,159
is this if you look at veggies grassland

655
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,789
and woods is it all essentially one

656
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,140
beetle community or is it something like

657
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,659
this where they're each completely

658
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,090
distinct beetle communities and of

659
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,180
course as most ecological answers are

660
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:21,759
the answers sort of or kind of or

661
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,500
somewhat but basically we ended up with

662
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,200
with data like this these are different

663
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,029
ground beetle species you know the

664
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,039
amount the percentage of captures and

665
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,920
the cultivated the edge areas in the

666
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,079
wilder section some of them are

667
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,930
basically only in the cultivated areas

668
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,269
but some of them spread out more widely

669
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:41,220
and to you know go further with this

670
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,930
you'd have to understand which of these

671
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,240
are really most important in terms of

672
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,680
those agro ecological services but again

673
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,799
it's just trying to look at the the

674
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,880
patterns of life on the landscape

675
00:27:48,799 --> 00:28:00,539
relative to the services they might

676
00:27:50,880 --> 00:28:02,460
provide ok so far we want it to ask ok

677
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,629
which if we look at these three areas we

678
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,920
look at the veggies we look at the woods

679
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,990
we look at the surrounding grassland

680
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,850
what are the what are the ones that are

681
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,859
most related to each other and we just

682
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:13,230
looked at correlations you know how how

683
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,819
closely correlated as the abundance of

684
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,799
ants spiders and ground beetles in

685
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,929
veggies versus ants spiders and ground

686
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,669
beetles in woodlands you know what's and

687
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,560
basically which this so is the higher

688
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:25,890
the value the more closely correlated

689
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,349
that the two communities were so grass

690
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,960
and wood yeah you know more than a third

691
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:32,189
of the cases were significantly

692
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,829
correlated more than a third of the

693
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,990
different insect groups who looked at

694
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:39,619
whereas woods and veggies were not so

695
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,180
closely correlated and so

696
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:45,179
diagrammatically the that's represented

697
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,430
by woods and grassland quite similar in

698
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,130
community or relatively grassland and

699
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:54,170
veggie and somewhat vegging woodland not

700
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,820
quite so much you don't need to see that

701
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,560
it was fine this I just put up there in

702
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,559
case our technician came we're also

703
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,569
looking at ads and Kyle the technische I

704
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,069
show you implicate ants and this is the

705
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:06,629
same sort of thing but for different ad

706
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:10,649
species if you're into ants I can show

707
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,970
you that slide in more detail later we'd

708
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,430
love to understand this is some of the

709
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,460
work that Emily did but not this in

710
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:20,009
particular but this whole theme of soils

711
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,779
again how has the landscape changed how

712
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:24,180
has soil life changed and how does that

713
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:25,889
affect what can happen today on the

714
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,759
landscape this is some historical data

715
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,560
on organic matter in cropland hey pastor

716
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,879
and forest in New York State I couldn't

717
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,909
find something specifically for our

718
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,450
County this is from our county it may or

719
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:41,340
may not be a completely valid comparison

720
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:44,039
but the forest value is you know around

721
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:44,799
seven but what's interesting is you know

722
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,779
the amount

723
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,029
organic matter here persons apparently

724
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:52,829
how much is decreased over that time

725
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:55,269
what effect has that had on soil life

726
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:56,589
you know this is this is the answer I

727
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,879
don't know what the answer is this was

728
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:59,289
one of our attempt to look at it and

729
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,420
it's just like all over the board I

730
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:05,859
won't even try to explain that Emily did

731
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,680
some work on the Hawthorne Valley Farm

732
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:11,349
where she looked at fields that had been

733
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,450
in hanging pasture and veggies over

734
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:16,299
quite a few at least 10 years we had

735
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,009
actually individual data on how much was

736
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:19,869
coming in and out of those fields what

737
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:22,029
effect did that have on the soils we did

738
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:24,189
grow outs you can talk to Emily about

739
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:26,519
that it was a somewhat was a somewhat

740
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:29,529
messy picture although interestingly

741
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,589
when you grew soils when you grew plants

742
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:34,539
in these soils it seems like the actual

743
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:37,119
the height of the plant did correspond

744
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:40,289
to what you predict very roughly from

745
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,729
our budgets of nutrients in and out

746
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,619
emily is nodding reassuringly that I'm

747
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,920
not talking complete nonsense when I'm

748
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:49,329
up here another thing to look at

749
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,250
ecological services that people don't

750
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:52,750
always think about is you know these are

751
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,190
some of the pastures at haathon Valley

752
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,450
and if you're a grazier you look at this

753
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,340
and say oh my god you know they're

754
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,100
grazing on that these things these

755
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:01,659
aren't sheep their cows but one thing

756
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:04,839
that people have started to look at is

757
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,759
actually the role of else let me just go

758
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,490
back I'll just use this the role of

759
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:11,650
fields like this in self-medication so

760
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,750
actually cows have been shown to

761
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,070
self-medicate to a certain degree and

762
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,079
that means they go out and they find

763
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:18,129
different plants in their landscape that

764
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,069
might help them if they've got a high

765
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,720
parasite load what is this important

766
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:26,049
does it have a milk effect we don't know

767
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,089
yet but that might be another sort of a

768
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:31,779
service that the Botanical diversity is

769
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:34,980
providing 22 cal health I'll go over

770
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:36,839
that I want to get the butterflies again

771
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,130
just a thought you know there's

772
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,959
obviously how these different habitats

773
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,490
are arranged around the farm but there's

774
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,940
also what you do on the farm this is a

775
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,920
wildflower strip and this farm happened

776
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,809
to be surrounded by wetland so we got

777
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,360
this amazing diversity of what actually

778
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,460
fairly rare wetland butterflies coming

779
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,469
in and neck during here and this was a

780
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,710
nice combination of how this farm was

781
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:02,149
actually inter

782
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:04,100
with its landscape okay going on to a

783
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:05,839
little bit other aspects of our program

784
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:07,339
you know we do work with farmers but we

785
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,259
work a lot with the general public and

786
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:10,990
you've got a picture columbia county is

787
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:14,210
two hours in north of New York City and

788
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,099
that means you know we have a lot of

789
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,409
second homes in some towns more than a

790
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:21,048
third of the homes or second homes what

791
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:22,730
is it here does anybody know what

792
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:26,599
proportion of homes our second homes

793
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:28,880
anybody got an idea I don't know but

794
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,038
anyway by the third or second homes we

795
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,620
have people coming up on weekends things

796
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,450
like that and so you have people coming

797
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,739
in they're often coming in with ideas

798
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,558
about how they want to manage the

799
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,048
landscape and part of our program is how

800
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:45,769
do you sort of help them you know slow

801
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:47,450
down and look at where they are without

802
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:49,490
telling them this is bad this is good

803
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,019
but just how do you help them realize a

804
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,200
bit better where they are in the

805
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,548
landscape and this is a little picture I

806
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,409
put together a long time ago but I still

807
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:58,940
like it and it actually came out of

808
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,380
talking to somebody who was a postdoc

809
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,679
over natural resources who was a

810
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,210
designer of parks and he said look if

811
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,278
you're going to have a park and you want

812
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,470
people to come you design it so that the

813
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,359
greatest diversity of people come to

814
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,940
that you might have art you might have

815
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,439
history you might have ecology and so

816
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,630
this is what I call a park of local

817
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,700
knowledge and caring and of course it

818
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,010
doesn't exist as a physical part but the

819
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,048
idea is if you want people to connect to

820
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:26,089
their landscape how can you bring them

821
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:28,308
into it well some people get connected

822
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,139
with food some love history some love

823
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:33,259
nature Appreciation some want to go

824
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,820
through formal schooling like some love

825
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:37,788
technology so maybe you have to do a

826
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:39,139
Facebook page but the idea is as we try

827
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:41,419
to connect people to the landscape how

828
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,090
can we diversify these different ways

829
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,080
that they can enter that landscape and

830
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:47,359
you know this is one this was our

831
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:50,089
attempt at ecotourism join the crazy

832
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,589
connection this was a really one that

833
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:53,538
took a bit of explaining to farmers this

834
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,740
was our pond study you know so why

835
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:56,359
exactly do you want to go out in the

836
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,970
middle of my mucky Cal pond with a canoe

837
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,129
we were doing sediment cores but anyway

838
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,960
we've had nobody take us up on this

839
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:06,030
offer you

840
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,190
we try to look at you know communicate

841
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:09,750
the idea of history because people like

842
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,820
to be part of a story this was a one

843
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,949
thing that really hit us that we hadn't

844
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,210
been expecting we went and we gave the

845
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,918
psychological talk we gave this a little

846
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,179
bit at the beginning about history we've

847
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,589
ever got done with the talking nobody

848
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,079
asked ecological questions they were all

849
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,970
fascinated with the history part and so

850
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,440
what we want to try to do is we don't

851
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:27,148
want to forget about the ecological part

852
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,369
that help people understand where they

853
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,898
are you're here you know you can sort of

854
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:32,970
say a big sign you're here this is where

855
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,648
history is at now history is going to

856
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:36,750
keep running what's happened in the past

857
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:38,579
and how does that affect where we may be

858
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,070
going this is actually happens to be

859
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:43,259
different animals in Columbia County

860
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,609
this was the sheep boom if any of you

861
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,040
have looked at agricultural history it

862
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,489
was a big and there's some you know

863
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,869
really high class espionage associated

864
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,059
with that there was actually the merino

865
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,858
sheep the Spanish sheep who are very

866
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:57,989
important very valued part of the

867
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,599
European wool production and there were

868
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:04,709
these all these covert actions to to get

869
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,909
sheep out of Europe this hat then this

870
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,570
is your goal you want to have one of

871
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:11,279
these in here so anyway this is just

872
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,680
agricultural history in Columbia County

873
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,300
over the years the different types of

874
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,769
production and I if anybody's interested

875
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,810
in attic history I can go into it but

876
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:20,608
I'm just trying to give you the feel for

877
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:23,869
what we communicate to people to help

878
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:27,179
them feel like they're part of something

879
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:28,829
but we also want to help them you know

880
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:30,750
yes we're interested in ecology yes

881
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:32,250
we're interested in agriculture but how

882
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,570
might that translate into the

883
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,980
communities that they're living in even

884
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,930
if they're not farmers and so this is

885
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,260
the percentage of the Columbia County

886
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:43,108
Workforce in agriculture service and

887
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,090
retail and manufacturing over about 200

888
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:46,799
years so it gives people you know we're

889
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:49,710
here right now we've got a huge service

890
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,390
retail component very little in

891
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,250
agriculture very little in manufacturing

892
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:55,409
not saying you want to go back here but

893
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,139
it shows you what has happened on the

894
00:35:55,409 --> 00:36:01,710
land and what might conceivably be

895
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:03,750
possible and we do want to talk about

896
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,358
land cover this is the amount of forest

897
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,219
over time the amount of farmland the

898
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,049
amount of shrubland again just trying to

899
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:13,118
say okay here's the history and then how

900
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:15,910
does that translate into the ecology

901
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,910
and we work in terms of how we get out

902
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:20,230
and work with people these are just some

903
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:22,509
of the ways some of the people we've

904
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,639
worked with we have interns we've got

905
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:27,309
people who are part of a natural history

906
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,778
participatory research group this is a

907
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:30,160
rice farmer from up in Vermont who just

908
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:31,509
really loves dragonflies it comes down

909
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,868
and spends a couple days with us each

910
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:37,329
year so just how we reach out to people

911
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:39,700
we work with some of the regional

912
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:41,950
conservation organizations many of whom

913
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:44,798
have farmland and so we help them with

914
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:46,268
management plans this is a really neat

915
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:48,159
if any of you are into shakers it's a

916
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:50,919
really fascinating story of ecology and

917
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:54,308
culture in Lebanon which I could go into

918
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,470
more of people are interested and we

919
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:59,859
appear at various events and we do

920
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:01,449
nature walks and we want to make sure we

921
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:02,858
did do some work with students so we get

922
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:05,139
them out there on the coldest rainiest

923
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:06,608
days and really what it makes you feel

924
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:09,068
is it makes you feel old so you know

925
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:10,179
there I am out there bundled up and

926
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:12,849
there was somebody in a t-shirt and

927
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:15,419
shorts a teenager obviously there's some

928
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:18,548
metabolic change has happened here that

929
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,159
but anyway and we try to go try to go

930
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:23,889
online this is our blog it's our

931
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:26,379
Facebook page this is our soon-to-be

932
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:30,159
launched redesigned web page but the

933
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,318
point is that trying to think of again

934
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,118
it's that Park idea you know I'm not

935
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,518
into facebook i never did facebook until

936
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,960
i had that thing that but people told us

937
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:40,209
you know a lot of the lot of younger

938
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,499
people do have Facebook pages that's a

939
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,079
group of people we haven't connected

940
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:46,480
with well so we have a Facebook page

941
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,859
it's fun I mean I do enjoy it this is

942
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,230
one of our main projects right now the

943
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:52,170
living land project the goal of this is

944
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,329
we're putting together a field guide to

945
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,608
the culture and ecology of our landscape

946
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:59,769
so we've been doing this happens to be

947
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,960
Columbia County where you see it this is

948
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:04,088
the outline we divvied it up into

949
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,650
different ecological regions and then

950
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:07,268
we're trying to look at the habitats in

951
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,190
each of these regions and we're going to

952
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:10,419
try to put it together field guide so if

953
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,639
you're a landowner you can go out and

954
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:16,329
say okay what's sort of forest do I have

955
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:18,129
in my backyard at the same time we also

956
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,589
want to look at the ecological chiral

957
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,789
aspect so the question becomes okay you

958
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:24,278
have this kind of forest in your

959
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,028
backyard how do your neighbors perceive

960
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:26,498
that forest

961
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:28,028
how might a farmer think of that forest

962
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:30,068
and we're not trying to say you know

963
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:32,349
that's the right perception that's the

964
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:34,568
wrong perception it's not that it's just

965
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:36,789
how does how do the people around you

966
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:38,108
perceive of that landscape and can we

967
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:40,179
use this approach to help people

968
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:44,969
understand you know not only where they

969
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:47,709
are culturally but also ecologically and

970
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:50,588
you get to have pretty got another

971
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:52,658
butterfly this is a big spring

972
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:55,058
salamander a beautiful orange bright

973
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:56,349
salamander like that at my and we hadn't

974
00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:00,519
found in the county my son said what's

975
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:04,959
this that's what it was finding more

976
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:07,208
orchids around and you know these sort

977
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:09,219
of pictures are important because again

978
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:11,108
who are we communicating with we're

979
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:15,938
communicating with people who are going

980
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:18,518
to rely congrat for example we want to

981
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:19,478
have the graphs to back up our ideas but

982
00:39:18,518 --> 00:39:23,889
this is how we're going to reach

983
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:26,858
people's their heart and then just a

984
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:28,900
little bit about what Anna's work has

985
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:32,318
been some of it already has to do with

986
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,119
connecting people to the landscape but

987
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:35,679
anna has done a lot of fun work looking

988
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,939
at the food system in the county and

989
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,159
again I'm not going to go into this in

990
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:41,048
detail but i can give you links it's on

991
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,659
our website i can connect you with anna

992
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:45,068
she did a whole project on the columbia

993
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:47,349
county food system because farmers were

994
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:50,038
farmers that asked us know what how does

995
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:52,749
this work economically and so she did

996
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,919
again you're not expected to read the

997
00:39:52,748 --> 00:39:57,009
small print unless you want to come up

998
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:58,929
and try to read it but you know CSAs how

999
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:00,938
do they relate to the different we have

1000
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:02,229
csas in the city we have csa is up in

1001
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:04,028
the county how do the perceptions that

1002
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:05,828
people have and what they want to get

1003
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:09,880
out of it differ based on where they're

1004
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:11,439
from farmers market what is it what are

1005
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,640
the prices what do people want to get

1006
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:14,199
from their farmers market anyway that

1007
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,108
kind of a study that helps us understand

1008
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:19,688
how people are using a landscape this

1009
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:21,338
was a fun project she did on new farmers

1010
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:23,858
I imagine it's the same here you

1011
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:27,130
probably got quite a few new farmers new

1012
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:28,630
farms coming up is that am i right and

1013
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,419
in Columbia County that's also the case

1014
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:35,949
and so she she interviewed many of these

1015
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:36,750
farmers put together profiles of each of

1016
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:38,579
the different farm

1017
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,380
and put together this is a map of again

1018
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:43,440
Columbia County going to get familiar

1019
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:46,050
with this shape and these are the

1020
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,000
different new farms there and partially

1021
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,269
again it gets it gives us an idea of how

1022
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,619
people are are using the ecology of

1023
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:54,480
people on this landscape I guess you

1024
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,309
could say and she also asked some more

1025
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,139
specific questions about their

1026
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:00,150
relationships to the land so as we try

1027
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,529
to communicate some of those like

1028
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,010
ecological maps I was showing you

1029
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:07,110
earlier well yeah we can stand up here

1030
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,220
and tell it well or share what we feel

1031
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,559
is important but we also need to

1032
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:12,299
understand what the people what they

1033
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,519
feel is important so try to understand

1034
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,280
their perspectives on the landscape can

1035
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,110
help us share ours more and also help us

1036
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,460
design our research so it's most useful

1037
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:25,140
for them and this is the part of the

1038
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,990
living land project it's what we call a

1039
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:29,699
special places display and it's

1040
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:32,819
basically this is there it is again

1041
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:34,230
lumbia County it's a big board where you

1042
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,730
get to come up to it like it if you're

1043
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,010
at a farmers market you come up to it

1044
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:41,280
and if you want to you can put where

1045
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,540
your special places on this map and you

1046
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,760
know where do you go to hunt where do

1047
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:46,199
you go to look for nice views where do

1048
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,940
you go when you want to go swimming or

1049
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,759
whatever that of course some of this in

1050
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,139
secret and people don't want to share

1051
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,750
but the idea is you come out with a map

1052
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:56,609
like this that starts to show you sort

1053
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,289
of the tapada the cultural topography of

1054
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,809
your landscape what are the places that

1055
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:03,179
are really neat to people and how again

1056
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,039
do you build that interest into helping

1057
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,289
them connect with their landscape may be

1058
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,699
spreading that interest out but also

1059
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:11,880
honoring the places that they want to

1060
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:13,739
visit or feel that are important so what

1061
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,599
do we learnt this is the hardest slide

1062
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,539
to make it's probably the most boring

1063
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,159
one to look at too but basically these

1064
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:21,659
are just some sort of the generalities

1065
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,190
that I would say we've been at this for

1066
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:27,809
about 10 years you know ecologically I

1067
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,599
think it still continues to surprise me

1068
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:33,059
how much land use history has an effect

1069
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,619
on what we're seeing today it's not

1070
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:37,019
that's not something new but again it's

1071
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,730
just what personally we learned and then

1072
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:41,070
the fine-scale patterns of the unseen

1073
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,199
world there's just to go on to the some

1074
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,690
force and go like Kyle who's the ant a

1075
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,099
biologist so he's found an ant that's

1076
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,659
common in Columbia County and the only

1077
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,818
other place that's known as Iowa Ohio

1078
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:54,098
so why why is it not known from New

1079
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:56,199
England I have no idea we have no idea

1080
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:57,640
but it's these sort of mysteries and

1081
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,019
patterns you know there's a lot going

1082
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:01,358
out there and they're responding two

1083
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:05,440
aspects the habitat but we don't see or

1084
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,088
understand a Glee ecology so I I mean I

1085
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,250
do believe that agriculture has the

1086
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:10,960
potential not saying it's automatic to

1087
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,250
create important natural concert nature

1088
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,130
conservation benefits through those

1089
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:16,539
analogies we talked about the AB and

1090
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,680
flow of farm relevant life in the

1091
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:21,010
importance of understanding community

1092
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:23,588
set so this is the this is those those

1093
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,630
agricultural services that I'm talking

1094
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:27,369
about and understanding where are these

1095
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,220
creatures coming from what's affecting

1096
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:32,349
how far they travel what's affecting the

1097
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:33,848
habitats they need for overwintering or

1098
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:35,588
what have you sir those commuting

1099
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:39,400
strategies relative to the aggregate

1100
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:41,889
collage achill services and then you

1101
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,530
know can we associate biodiversity

1102
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:49,179
actually with benefits in production and

1103
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:51,250
that's a big if but but it's sort of the

1104
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:55,419
core of really making this relevant for

1105
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:57,608
the farmers sociologically you know one

1106
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,740
of the fun things I had not worked with

1107
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:01,358
farmers before going on in interacting

1108
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:03,189
with farmers a lot of them are really

1109
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,480
just key if you didn't come in in a

1110
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,119
situation where you know you're doing

1111
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,639
this wrong this this Creek is all dirty

1112
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,660
you shouldn't be doing this but more let

1113
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,969
me just show you what's in your creek

1114
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:15,548
great you know I my kids play in the

1115
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:17,019
creek I sometimes wade in the creek I'd

1116
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:18,460
love to know more about the nature and

1117
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:19,509
so a lot of the farmers were really

1118
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,150
interested in that although you might

1119
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,410
not have the time to do much about it

1120
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:27,430
people like to be part of a story I

1121
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:30,009
talked about that um it's hard to find a

1122
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:31,659
substitute for person to for into

1123
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,609
individual interactions you know you can

1124
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:34,989
put together and this is what funding

1125
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:37,150
agencies want you to do they want you to

1126
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:39,759
put together pamphlets to give to

1127
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,910
farmers to tell them what to do there's

1128
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,039
value in that but working interacting

1129
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:47,170
with the farmers individually much

1130
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,789
smaller group of people but I think you

1131
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:52,750
have a much bigger potentially much

1132
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:54,809
bigger impact the range of ecological

1133
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,429
knowledge among people is alarming and

1134
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:59,559
awe-inspiring so it's just it's been

1135
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:00,969
really fun where you find people that

1136
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:01,490
know you wouldn't expect it in they go

1137
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,989
oh yeah

1138
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:04,609
I know that yeah I know what this is and

1139
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:06,679
then other places where you go I have no

1140
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,470
idea wait wait you don't have any idea

1141
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:11,719
so it's it's it's all the way that that

1142
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:14,449
sort of a realization is always

1143
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:16,879
interesting and ecological humility is a

1144
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:19,609
learned trait and this is one of the

1145
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,750
things as people come up and want to do

1146
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,980
landscaping you know they have this

1147
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,269
vision of what they want to do with

1148
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,840
their land and trying to convince them

1149
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:29,239
to take a year or two to understand

1150
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,380
where the land is add is some time to

1151
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,849
have that humility is sometimes

1152
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:37,010
difficult and again this is just deserve

1153
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:38,960
a summary of how we view what we do you

1154
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,300
know we want to build compassion and

1155
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,400
stewardship for the land well that's

1156
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,380
going to come if people love the land

1157
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,510
and if you love something you have

1158
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,730
curiosity about it the curiosity you ask

1159
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,650
questions with leads to research and you

1160
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,940
build knowledge and the more you know

1161
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,510
about something potentially the more you

1162
00:45:52,940 --> 00:46:00,289
love it so this is kind of how we view

1163
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:03,290
what we do as a program and the last

1164
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:06,849
very very last proposed study and this

1165
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:10,599
is short so don't worry almost time

1166
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:10,599
you're still following me way

1167
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:16,558
this is these are maps that we did not

1168
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:18,480
do but this is scenic Hudson recently

1169
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,220
came out this relates to this study were

1170
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,139
thinking about recently came out with it

1171
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:24,449
they call foodshed conservation studies

1172
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,460
so that what they looked at is the the

1173
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,169
farms that sell in new york city where

1174
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,030
are they located and in the Hudson

1175
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,400
Valley this is where those farms are

1176
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,230
located and so they prioritized areas

1177
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,269
based on where those farms are in terms

1178
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,030
of conservation and the question is okay

1179
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:40,889
let's go the next step this is

1180
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:44,039
production conservation this is not

1181
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:46,288
nature conservation so how do you take a

1182
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,420
map like that and then start to

1183
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:51,240
translate it into okay how can that

1184
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,670
farmland production conservation also

1185
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:55,379
have an important nature conservation

1186
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:56,760
component so what role can Hudson Valley

1187
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,890
farming play in regional nature

1188
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,569
conservation given the diversity of

1189
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:02,788
landscapes in the valley how can farming

1190
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,889
best support native species what are the

1191
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:09,210
sub-region specific target ecological

1192
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:11,639
analogies in other words you know this

1193
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,769
is up in here for example we have a lot

1194
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,920
of fence Ozar the calcareous wetlands

1195
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:18,960
farms play a role in preserving fens but

1196
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,210
that may be irrelevant over here there

1197
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,400
may be some other habitats that farms

1198
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,798
are playing a more important role in so

1199
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,318
trying to understand the distribution of

1200
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:31,849
those target conservation communities is

1201
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:33,960
one aspect of what we want to try to do

1202
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,910
what role can nature play in supporting

1203
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,099
hudsonville and fart valley farming okay

1204
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:40,139
so that's going into what that other

1205
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:43,099
part of the talk I had know what are the

1206
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:46,348
cert how can these natural areas also

1207
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:49,619
help provide services to the farms

1208
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:51,059
themselves you know a big and there's

1209
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,980
technical questions in there how do we

1210
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,510
how do we measure those services in a

1211
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,679
relevant way and I you know I don't know

1212
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,420
the answer this is part of what we're

1213
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,690
trying to work on and it's in

1214
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,180
collaboration with some people here and

1215
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:06,889
some people at scenic Hudson and some

1216
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:10,190
other places so that

1217
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:10,190
is the end

1218
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:27,679
this has been a production of Cornell

1219
