1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,918
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:16,320
University anyway uh I think everybody's

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,359
aware of the importance of the lakes to

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,079
the

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,039
Landscapes I think that most residents

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,879
are clear that what happens in the

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,960
watersheds is reflected in what goes on

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:33,759
in the lake and uh what I want to do to

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,000
today is summarize about 40 Years of my

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,000
experience with it we've got some

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,920
problems with

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,359
units and I guess I better try to get

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,198
some of this straightened out first the

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,840
volume of the lake is

15
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:51,039
about 10,000 million cubic meters if

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,960
that means anything to you it's kind of

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,719
up there with national debt and stuff

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,878
like

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,920
that if a tornado sucked all the water

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,358
out of the lake it would take 10 to 15

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,359
years for the Lake to

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,760
refill the deepest part's about 400 ft

23
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,840
so that gives you an idea of what we're

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,359
talking about now we're going to talk

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,920
about we're we're looking about

26
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:15,079
concentrations of phosphate which

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,359
instead of one with lots of zeros now

28
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,798
it's a lot of zeros in a small number uh

29
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:26,319
most of the times we talk about a parts

30
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:31,479
per billion of phosphate that's 5 * 10-

31
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:35,559
6 G per liter or it's about 5 * 10 - 3 G

32
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:38,000
per cubic me meter but please note that

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,240
most of the nitrate is talked about in

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,519
terms of parts per million which a

35
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,919
thousand times more concentrated than

36
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,118
phosphate one example that we'll see

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,599
later probably if you put a cubic meter

38
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:56,438
if you had a pallet here with a cubic

39
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,399
meter by the way is about a cubic yard

40
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,118
if you put that in the lake and

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,960
dissolved it you'd increase the

42
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,840
phosphate concentration by about 3 to

43
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:09,239
five parts per billion that's just where

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,840
chlorophyll concentrations commonly part

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,800
per billion micrograms per liter and if

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,479
you look at what goes on in this early

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,599
spring chlorophyll concentration

48
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,238
increases as a parts per billion not

49
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,518
equal parts per billion of phosphate

50
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,400
carbon content of the algae is sort of

51
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,039
50 to 100 times the chlorophyll

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,519
content okay one of the things that's

53
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,280
important to think about is the

54
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:39,519
biological activity in kugula depends on

55
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,158
the photosynthesis by the Aly and that

56
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,560
is that energy from the

57
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:47,120
photosynthesis is an

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,519
important source of energy for all of

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,239
the biological activity in the

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,879
lake uh most of the things we're talking

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,599
about the chlorophyll and the phosphate

62
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,199
are measured using standard universally

63
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:04,039
accepted methods all of data is online

64
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,479
are in two very important thesis at

65
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:09,798
Cornell so I I None of well some of this

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,479
data is mine but an awful lot of it

67
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,480
isn't what I really want to do is look

68
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,798
this is the theme inputs of streams

69
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,119
determines phosphate in the lake deep

70
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,319
lake which determines phosphate in the

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,360
cace water in the summer or spring and

72
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,518
that determines the alal proliferation

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,159
in the summer and we measure it by

74
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,438
chlorophyll so we're going to you're

75
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,318
going to see that couple of times 5

76
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:38,039
years ago I decided to assemble the

77
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:42,079
stream and like data from 1972 through

78
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:45,239
2011 uh since uh 1972 I'd collected

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,319
about 2,000 water samples about 2,000

80
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,920
Lake samples were available I had a lot

81
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,000
of professional interest after I retired

82
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,399
and I wanted to challenge my brain and

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,120
believe me this has been a good

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,120
challenge for my

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,319
brain in 1960 to for history

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,239
Environmental Quality became a major

87
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,639
concern at the University agriculture

88
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,519
kind of realized food production

89
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,279
Agriculture and the environment were all

90
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,918
tied together and the late Bob Young

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,000
assembled a team of professors Sports

92
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:23,879
docs grad students research staff etc

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,279
etc and I happen to be uh one of those

94
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:31,279
uh people and during that period 1972 to

95
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,599
77 it was a very very active group we

96
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,559
produced several thesis scientific

97
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,199
Publications a book a bulletin major

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,319
emphasis on the lake streamwater

99
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,919
agricultural economics animal science

100
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,639
manure management guess what rural

101
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,519
sociology but the whole theme was to

102
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,960
integrate

103
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:56,918
it we uh produced a

104
00:04:52,959 --> 00:05:00,319
book and uh these are the project

105
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,399
authors now integration of every thing

106
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,918
was a

107
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:09,079
major purpose the group met for at least

108
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,839
two hours every second week for six

109
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,639
years and we had a lot of discussions

110
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,279
and all of everybody had to go if they

111
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,879
got money and Bob Young watched he no he

112
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:22,719
didn't

113
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:26,240
take take ascendant but he was really uh

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,280
a really just an incredible leader uh

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,879
there are two people here I want to talk

116
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:35,478
about one is Ray O's and of course

117
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:40,120
myself but Ray was the lake person and

118
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:43,478
we had to start early on okay so how am

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,720
I going to analyze water samples and how

120
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:49,318
is he going to have analyze Lake samples

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,680
so that once the water gets in the lake

122
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,319
there's not some big you know Cliff or

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,319
something like that we spent a lot of

124
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,080
time on that we

125
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:01,120
exchanged uh Labs samples between labs

126
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,560
and so on so I want to really point that

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
out because later it's going to become

128
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,598
important the other person I want to

129
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,800
point out is Keith Porter helped uh uh

130
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,199
edit the book and all of that uh Ed goad

131
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,319
is sitting back there Ed stand up can

132
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,360
you he was the guy that went out on

133
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,199
weekends and nights and whatever and

134
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,840
took water samples during

135
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,639
storm so anyway he's I'm glad to see him

136
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,598
here okay uh if we start with kind of

137
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,918
the conclusions from the

138
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:38,519
1977 uh thing the levels of algae in the

139
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,799
lake are determined by the dissolved

140
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,038
phosphorus present in the lake in the

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,598
early spring and the other important

142
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,360
issue once you get enriched algae you

143
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,639
can get rid of it by just getting rid of

144
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,199
the phosphorus inputs real question is

145
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,680
that consistent with 1999 to 211 and all

146
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,079
I want to do is just throw this up there

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,879
don't pay much attention to it you see a

148
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,959
lot of later I just want to see okay

149
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,720
here's the phosphate in the spring

150
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,918
chlorophyll in the summer and yeah

151
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,759
there's a lot of noise but it's surely

152
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,758
clear a clear relationship the two the

153
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,080
question is how did we get to phosphate

154
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,639
in the spring so let's start with C the

155
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,079
lake and its watersheds and uh this map

156
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,199
defines the source of the drainage and

157
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,519
the lake surface area is about uh 10% of

158
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,478
the water shed

159
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:31,519
area now we adopt it as our model

160
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:34,079
Watershed Fall Creek

161
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,918
for several reasons first of all it has

162
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:40,758
a mix of agricultural and Forest land

163
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,878
uses which is fairly typical of the rest

164
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,080
of the watersheds so what we're going to

165
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,800
do is look at what happens with Fall

166
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,240
Creek and we're going to extrapolate

167
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,720
that to the rest of the watersheds via

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,400
this idea the other important issue with

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,000
we had USGS flow data from 1926 to the

170
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,519
present this will turn out to be

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,560
extremely important second thing I

172
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:08,359
sampled about 100 ft above the USGS

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,158
station I walked over the sampling site

174
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,800
on my way to my office in the morning if

175
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,478
I took a sample I just put it in my

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,280
laboratory or did it did the processing

177
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:22,120
myself and that's all close to my office

178
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,519
and uh watersheds about 20% of the

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,759
watershed area now this is a just a

180
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:31,560
brief map of the watered itself notice

181
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,200
that they two BR two main branches at

182
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,879
Freeville it contes on North from

183
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,800
Freeville and then to the east it's

184
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,759
Virgil Creek we did other small villages

185
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,719
uh and population

186
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,838
densities

187
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,278
uh basically uh I think it's reasonable

188
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,480
to say that it's a pretty

189
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:59,439
good uh representation of most of the

190
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,519
waters here's the bridge at Forest or

191
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Forest Home put

192
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,039
of

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,039
uh next to Forest I'm

194
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:15,799
sorry Pleasant grow Road see okay but

195
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,200
anyway what's important is you see the

196
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,278
pathway along the edge of the bridge

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
that's where I took all the samples I

198
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,879
stored my sampling tools in the

199
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,399
superstructure of the

200
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,559
bridge uh and here's uh where I here's

201
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,879
where I sampled from and notice it comes

202
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,359
through there and it's pretty well mixed

203
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:37,720
uh here's a nice winter scene a low very

204
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,240
low flow uh ice and snow are accumulated

205
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,680
in the Watershed we get a a thaw and oh

206
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,120
all sorts of funny things happen notice

207
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,879
how dark the water is there's a lot of

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,240
sediment in it there's a lot of

209
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,399
phosphorus in it and it's very very

210
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,759
important to take these samples from

211
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,839
steams like that here's another one this

212
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,078
is a summer storm uh

213
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:08,399
uh this is a picture of the USGS uh

214
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:10,958
control uh stream on a nice summer day

215
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,039
uh here just some Landscapes notice

216
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,479
agricultural land Woods in the

217
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,199
background uh more agricultural land

218
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,240
notice it background buildings and

219
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,600
diversity of crops and more Forest

220
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,680
here's a just a view across the valley

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,320
and

222
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:32,559
again uh Landscapes and uh Woods here

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,639
here's the creek above free Veil uh

224
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:39,319
notice the Abundant vegetation along the

225
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:42,919
stream notice the little Stones flat

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,120
stones that are there these streams are

227
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:49,278
pretty well uh

228
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,240
stabilized uh notice now that there's a

229
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,480
stream in the background in the middle

230
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,079
of this slide but look at the uh

231
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,000
buffering between the stream and the

232
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,919
agricultural land it's like at the top

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,200
of the creek here's the Fall Creek

234
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,599
before Lake comoo again notice the

235
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,759
buffering this is a Virgil

236
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,079
Creek and one of the things I want to

237
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,559
emphasize here don't worry about the

238
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:16,039
nitrate thing it's also a source of

239
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,599
phosphorus okay so let's get to the

240
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:24,480
data what I have here

241
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:28,040
is uh a summary from 72 to

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,959
2008 the log concentration the log of

243
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,599
load which is float times concentration

244
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,799
so that's the amount of substance or for

245
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
this case

246
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,159
phosphorus

247
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:44,159
uh taken to the lake versus the flow and

248
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:47,000
flow is always a convenient way to to

249
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,039
summarize the data uh what I want you to

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,639
notice though really is to look at the

251
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:57,120
difference in the color of the St sample

252
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:01,959
points uh the black ones are 72 to

253
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:06,959
75 the red is 2 6 the green is

254
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:10,479
2208 n what I want to conclude from this

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,838
is the loading has not changed

256
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,320
appreciably in the period

257
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,680
1972 to 2009 now statistically I presume

258
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,399
you might think of a model that would

259
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,319
enable you to do a good statistical test

260
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,440
my attitude is hey you know I'm not

261
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,959
going to go there I look at these so

262
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,720
make up your mind

263
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,759
uh if you say oh forget about it I don't

264
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,600
believe it but anyway we'll see this

265
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,319
later so how do you do well the one

266
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:44,000
thing I do want to point out here notice

267
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,639
the variability in loads versus one

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,919
given flow and you think oh my goodness

269
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,480
this is sloppy laboratory work that is

270
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,679
not sloppy laboratory work we've done a

271
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,240
lot of samples in which you take

272
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,359
consecutive samples within a few minutes

273
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
of each other and take them to the

274
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,800
laboratory and there's very little

275
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,039
variation

276
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,479
if you wait a few hours and take another

277
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,198
sample you get into that variability

278
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,320
that you see there so how do we deal

279
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:14,599
with that variability the first way is

280
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,560
look at load versus flow and usually you

281
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,159
can do some mathematics of that and you

282
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:23,159
can either Lo use a log or a linear

283
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:27,600
scale the big deal is take lots of

284
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:30,159
samples samples all seasons and years

285
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
samples storms low flow and everything

286
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,838
else because it takes that many samples

287
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,879
to really uh get what you need to know

288
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,959
now I did a here's another way to look

289
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:45,879
at the

290
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:48,759
data uh this is a concentration now it's

291
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,198
not the quantity it's the concentration

292
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,360
per unit

293
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:56,879
volume and instead of doing with with

294
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,440
flow I've done it with uh flow ranges

295
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:06,958
and these different boxes are 0 to 50

296
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,199
CPS 50 to 99 Etc all the way up to, 1500

297
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,838
to 2,000 cubic feet per second and the

298
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,958
last one is over 3,000 Cub I don't you

299
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,079
you probably looked

300
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:21,278
at box plots before I pulled one one

301
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:25,120
little thing out and pulled it over to

302
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:28,399
the left and that bottom of that

303
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,360
box is at the concentration that

304
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,919
includes

305
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,680
everything below that

306
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,439
concentration or that's the 25% of the

307
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,319
samples are below that concentration if

308
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,560
you go to the median 50% of course the

309
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:48,040
top of the box is 75% and the whisker is

310
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:50,758
90% so this is a convenient way to

311
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:53,278
summarize and what I finally did was

312
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,039
just do a regression of average

313
00:14:53,278 --> 00:15:00,439
un uh average of the different uh flow

314
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:04,919
so this is our equation

315
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:10,600
that converts flow in cubic feet per

316
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:15,599
second to concentration of soluble

317
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:18,800
phosphorus in terms of per unit

318
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,000
volume you'll see this later well okay

319
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,359
now we've defined the load and the

320
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,958
concentration for Fall Creek 1972 to

321
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,800
2008 next we extrapolate to all the

322
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,439
watersheds first approximation one thing

323
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,399
that's pretty well documented flow per

324
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,600
unit of drainage area is the same for

325
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:44,078
all water sheds uh area of Fall Creeks

326
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:48,360
20% of the total area of the lake lake

327
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,879
shed so five times Fall Creek is equal

328
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,159
to

329
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,120
uh in input into what of all the water

330
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,439
sheds well you might expect an

331
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,799
approximation okay we're going to also

332
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,440
extra at the load from Fall Creek to the

333
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,479
whole

334
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,759
wed well we've Dev developed now the

335
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,199
loading from watersheds now we turn our

336
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,480
attention to how to relate this to

337
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,599
phosphate in the lake and algo

338
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,680
production now there's two things about

339
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,519
the lake that are pretty important to

340
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:23,879
understand the first one is and I don't

341
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,198
think there's any controversy about this

342
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,519
fall and winter the lake

343
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:32,198
cools reaches four degrees

344
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,120
it's mixed thoroughly by March the

345
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:37,039
dissolved constituents and the lake are

346
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,240
equal north to south east to west top to

347
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,759
bottom etc etc now during the summer

348
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,360
things are a little different because

349
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,360
the surface water warms up and water

350
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,839
floats on top and that's where the solar

351
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,199
radiation is and the algo begin to grow

352
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,399
and they proliferate primarily in the

353
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,278
surface

354
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:03,039
layer so now we conclude that the

355
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:06,519
phosphate in the Deep cold water in the

356
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,519
lake is an integrated average of stream

357
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,558
inputs over months and years and recall

358
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,318
that Lake deeper than 60 mters does not

359
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,000
mix during the summer with the warm

360
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:21,119
surface but it does in the wintertime so

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,078
now the deep water changes slowly over

362
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,159
years and it turns out we have a really

363
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,759
really

364
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,320
good set of data on the deep water in

365
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,400
the lake first first of all the research

366
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:36,079
in the 68 to

367
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,720
74 uh by Ray Oglesby and John

368
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:44,240
Barlo sampled the lake all the depths

369
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,440
all the year since then the lak source

370
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,919
cooling people have taken samples of the

371
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,360
intake for the lake Source cooling which

372
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,400
is deep water 60 plus meters so those

373
00:17:53,359 --> 00:18:00,079
two things we know what the

374
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,320
concentration in the lake water has been

375
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,079
or something wait a minute there's a

376
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,200
missing slide here where is it oh here

377
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,199
it

378
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:13,480
is the graph on the left is the

379
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:18,960
concentration in the deep

380
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,360
water and the xaxis is here notice in

381
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:27,120
the upper left hand

382
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:30,479
side there's the 68 to 74 data and then

383
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:34,319
beginning 25 years l later in

384
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,640
1999 the concentration has dropped to uh

385
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,279
somewhere around four to three to four

386
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,679
to five and then it gradually increases

387
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:47,119
as we go from there so why this large

388
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,759
difference between 74 and 99 it's about

389
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,319
eight if you

390
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:56,798
compare

391
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:59,240
uh uh 99 and uh 210 and it's if you go

392
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,558
later it's about six parts per B

393
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,679
so why

394
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:08,200
well we go back to we go back to our

395
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,120
1972 to 77

396
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,880
data and if you you don't recall

397
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:19,558
probably uh the uh phosphate and

398
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,559
detergent was banned beginning in

399
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:28,959
1973 so we had spent we spent a lot of

400
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:35,599
time in all our deliberations from uh 7

401
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:39,558
2 to 77 on the impact of this on uh the

402
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:43,439
phosphate in the lake and it turns out

403
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:47,000
that detergent P this the phosphate in

404
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,600
the detergent was a very large fraction

405
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,919
of the total phosphate going into the

406
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:55,038
lake from sewed population as a matter

407
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,759
of fact the two together are about a

408
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:02,119
half a kilogram per cap per year

409
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:06,200
Now by

410
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:09,798
2005 100% of the detergent P has

411
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,720
disappeared on top of that the lake

412
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:16,000
Cornel or the itha sewage treatment

413
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,120
plant has removed on the order probably

414
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,480
a little more than half of the excreted

415
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,599
P so this is a if you look at just the

416
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,120
SE population which of course that uh

417
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,119
the output from the sewer plant was

418
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,558
going directly into the lake it was

419
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:35,759
about 40 4,000 kilos per year for the

420
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:39,639
whole plate for the 40,000 unored about

421
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:43,279
11,000 kilos P per year and the total is

422
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,600
about 55 now obviously these are kind of

423
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,678
broad

424
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:49,399
generalizations but if you look at that

425
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,798
10,000 million cubic meters of Lake

426
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,480
water that's equivalent to about 5 to

427
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,200
six parts per billion

428
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,480
decrease in what you would expect to

429
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,159
find in in the

430
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,319
lake and I think it's it's well docu I

431
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,520
can document all of this uh if you want

432
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,720
to find out about it you can read the

433
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:17,759
book uh anyway now we're back to looking

434
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,759
at this uh difference between 99 and

435
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,759
2011 which is documented by The lak

436
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,879
Source cooling data and notice it does

437
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,319
go from somewhere around 5 to somewhere

438
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,200
around 10 in that period of

439
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:35,519
time and so the question is what

440
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,360
happened well again we're back to the

441
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,639
lake it's very large annual puts the

442
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,599
water sheds varies between in 10 to 15%

443
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,360
of the lake volume so now if you're

444
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,558
changing the amount of phosphate going

445
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:53,119
into the lake in a given year you're not

446
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:57,079
going to see that right away you have to

447
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,839
wait in at least uh 5 years 6 years 2

448
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:02,240
years whatever what is it how can you

449
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,759
how can you do that well I puzzled over

450
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,319
that for a while one of the real key

451
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,919
issues is in

452
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:14,319
1972 uh the chloride in the lake had

453
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,880
increased to about 100 parts per billion

454
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:21,918
and uh Steve eer and his

455
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,240
group uh noticed that that had started

456
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,960
the choride started to go down once they

457
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:32,519
quit putting that uh uh the fines in the

458
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,919
Blake for from uh the excess of mining

459
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:39,359
it's about 100 parts per million in

460
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,799
1970 by 1976 it gone down to about 60

461
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,479
parts per million and you can see that's

462
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:47,839
kind of a gradual decrease approaching

463
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,400
probably the current chloride steady

464
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,759
state in the lake of around 55 parts per

465
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,798
bit so that tells us right off hand oh

466
00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:00,400
okay that Lake's big and chloride said

467
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:03,558
we got problems so oh okay here things

468
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,679
get now we start looking at Stream

469
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:12,678
flow and this graph is 1963 to

470
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:16,960
2010 the green things are

471
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:21,000
yearly uh loading well no this is full

472
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,159
yearly flow data notice the black line

473
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,079
which is fiveyear rolling average and

474
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:31,720
how that goes through episodes of high

475
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:34,119
and low flow so now we say oh wait a

476
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,159
minute how are we going to average this

477
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,558
over

478
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,440
years if we sort of say hey the amount

479
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,798
of flow determines the amount delivered

480
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,000
to the lake okay so here's the here's

481
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,759
the approach we first of all on the far

482
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,038
left graph we've you've seen that before

483
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,119
that's chloride in the lake as it

484
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:57,480
decreases over time the second graph is

485
00:23:54,119 --> 00:24:00,399
the delivery of water that flow into the

486
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,599
lake fiveyear

487
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,200
averages the next one is the

488
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,839
concentration versus

489
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,000
flow we're going to combine those the

490
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,759
two midal ones and then we have to see

491
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,679
if what we can do to get

492
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:24,200
that to finally see how that

493
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:27,880
impacts the phosphate in the deep

494
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,759
lake so we've got all of that together

495
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:35,720
uh and how many years no no here's where

496
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:38,759
things get a little messy maybe so look

497
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:43,200
I know what the flow is for this

498
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:46,960
history uh the concentration box plot

499
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,798
tells me how that concentration is

500
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,519
distributed as we go through flow

501
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:57,839
regimes there are 750 samples in that

502
00:24:53,519 --> 00:25:00,759
box plot now we're going to say ah we've

503
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:05,879
got that that's good data so now we

504
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:08,960
start our our uh Matrix the First Column

505
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,120
we list the uh let me go back I think

506
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,960
maybe be a little clear if we start the

507
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:17,439
first column in that no I think not it's

508
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,200
hard to get this all tied together the

509
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,120
first column we list the concentration

510
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,798
of the de leap Lake that's for each year

511
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:27,558
1999 to

512
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,879
2011 the next column is the amount of

513
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:32,839
flow

514
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:36,520
are the load the preceding year the

515
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:39,480
second column is the average load over

516
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,119
the two preceding years third

517
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,798
column

518
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,158
is uh three years Etc it's said all the

519
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:50,038
way out to 10

520
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:53,919
years so we got that so

521
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:57,158
now here's a just sort of a piece of

522
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,360
Matrix got a year Lake P first year Tech

523
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:05,559
Year all out to 10 Etc

524
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:10,278
okay now we take we look at the we put

525
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:15,440
this into correlation coefficient

526
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:17,038
Matrix uh I little there little small

527
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,080
but let's say so these are the

528
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:23,839
correlation the the second column in is

529
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,398
uh uh

530
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,678
the correlation coefficient between the

531
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:32,359
phosphate and the lake

532
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,880
and the stream average input for the

533
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:38,558
first year second year third year fourth

534
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,240
year Etc and if you look at the

535
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,720
correlation coefficients first one year

536
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,720
forget about it uh second year it's a

537
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,278
little better third year is better still

538
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,079
finally you get to six years you get a

539
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:53,119
correlation coefficient of

540
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:56,960
089 my interpretation is

541
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,879
a that's the key issue is summarize

542
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,360
Stream flow

543
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,840
our stream inputs over six years and

544
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,278
that should be correlated well it is

545
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,199
correlated obviously with the phosphate

546
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,919
in the deep lake and I want to call you

547
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,200
your attention to the right hand column

548
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,759
which indicates the number of days in

549
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,519
that average now

550
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:24,079
remember the

551
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:27,839
concentration the the boxplot with

552
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,199
concentration for flow regimes for flow

553
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,519
uh

554
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,480
uh rate

555
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:38,398
essentially well we've used the USGS

556
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,759
data we know what the flow is every day

557
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:44,518
for how many years you want in there and

558
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,240
it's about 2,000 days go into that

559
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:51,558
six-year average so if we've done a good

560
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,599
job of getting an unbiased sample of

561
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:57,798
flow regimes based

562
00:27:53,599 --> 00:28:00,480
on uh our 750 samples all we're doing is

563
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:04,480
just taking samples of that out and

564
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,440
applying it to 2,000 days so I think

565
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,640
this is this is this is a pretty unbi I

566
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,600
think this is pretty

567
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,679
unbiased the whole problem may be biased

568
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:18,639
estimate of how to do it but in terms of

569
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:22,440
the loading of phosphate from the stream

570
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,440
I think that's a pretty unbiased

571
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:30,839
estimate so we've okay we've got the

572
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:33,440
Stream inputs averaged over the previous

573
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:37,678
six years is about the best

574
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,679
concentration of deep water in the

575
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,080
lake so now there are about four

576
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,798
variables that we pick as really

577
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,240
important and this is correlation

578
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,480
Matrix 2000 to

579
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,159
2011 10 degrees of

580
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,319
freedom okay the first the six-year

581
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,360
business that's the sixe

582
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:06,119
input from the

583
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:08,678
stream the eff is the deep water

584
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:15,558
measured in the effluent from the lake

585
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:19,480
Source cooling system the lake El LK uh

586
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:22,398
APR is the measured phosphate in the

587
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,278
lake in April which is part of the lake

588
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:29,479
Source cooling data all the Chlor all

589
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:31,359
CHL is chloride for the whole lake or

590
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,079
chlorophyll for the whole

591
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:38,639
lake uh well the Corr 1% probability

592
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:43,918
correlation coefficients

593
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,759
68 uh obviously the chlorophyll and the

594
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,200
other things is sort of okay uh

595
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,519
particularly you want to call your

596
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,519
attention to the six-year correlation

597
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,120
with the affluent that's the measured

598
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,480
deep

599
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:05,639
concentration the the uh Lake phosphate

600
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,519
in April is not the best uh all the all

601
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:12,919
chloride in the summer is not bad and

602
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:14,359
anyway uh I think those are reasonable

603
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,720
correlation

604
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:22,918
coefficients considering this is kind of

605
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:27,839
40 years of experience from lots of

606
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,720
different uh sources of samples etc etc

607
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,839
uh

608
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,200
uh so we pretty well it's so here's my

609
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:39,079
summary of the relationships we started

610
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,640
out and I think that the correlation

611
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,359
coefficients pretty well say well yep

612
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,759
that's not too

613
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:50,079
bad I just summary here's SRP in the

614
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,440
lake in the summer versus that's the uh

615
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,158
phosphorus in the lake in the summer

616
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,200
versus uh six-year average from stream

617
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,880
inputs summer chlorophile sixe average

618
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,840
of stream

619
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,080
inputs there's obviously a lot of things

620
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,359
to be done there here's just four of

621
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,199
those things kind of put together all

622
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:13,240
right let's get down to the general

623
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,278
summary uh okay so what have we learned

624
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,960
the phosphate concentrations varied from

625
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:23,558
4 to 15 micrograms per liter 1974 to

626
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,038
2011 concentration of phosphate in the

627
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:30,599
spring is correlated with the six-year

628
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:33,278
average of phosph fate input from the

629
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:36,678
streams chlorop fils increased and

630
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:39,480
decreased in Phase with the variation in

631
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,120
phosphate but there's a lot of variation

632
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,159
that's not explained by the phosphate

633
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:48,439
this is a

634
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:51,880
multi variable problem most likely

635
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:56,880
things to look at more carefully is

636
00:31:51,880 --> 00:32:00,399
temperature solar radiation wind etc etc

637
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,840
well I looked at that a little bit and I

638
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,439
decided it was beyond

639
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,158
my ability to deal with it I didn't have

640
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,639
the data I thought

641
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,960
anyway the second one chlorophyll

642
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,638
conservation has varied from 4 to 10

643
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,319
micrograms per liter and within the

644
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:19,879
period 68 to

645
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:24,319
2011 and I would

646
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,600
argue that we have covered a lot

647
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,638
of history of the

648
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:33,158
lake if we want to look for the guide to

649
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:37,558
the future I would say uh you could look

650
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,559
at the chlorophyll concentration

651
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:46,398
but uh since you go to uh other things

652
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,278
you can look at the deep

653
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:54,038
lake or six years or

654
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:57,278
whatever there's a lot of variability

655
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:59,599
but that's going to happen one of the

656
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,759
things that I I think is very very

657
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:06,359
important a lot of

658
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:08,720
people I think at least my scuttlebutt

659
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,479
is they look at the lake and says oh it

660
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,798
looks terrible it must be all that

661
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,679
phosphorus that went in it's all that

662
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:18,480
chlorophyll that's really far far from

663
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,480
the truth the reality is there have

664
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,079
loudest suspended silin that are

665
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,278
consequence of all those siment all the

666
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,879
settlement that's gone in with all the

667
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:32,359
storm

668
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,840
and that's all mixed up with chlorophyll

669
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,199
and if you really look at chlorophyll in

670
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:43,638
a very clean

671
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:47,319
Lake uh this the uh Lake's very clear

672
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:50,519
and it looks clean etc etc so I think

673
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:54,240
that a lot of misinformation and

674
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:58,359
whatever about the way the the lake

675
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,000
looks is not necessarily just chlorop

676
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,240
it's partly chlorophyll but very often

677
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,159
if you look today I don't I haven't

678
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,679
looked today but last two or three days

679
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,960
you see a lot of stuff in the lake right

680
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,240
that's sediment from

681
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,199
storms in Spring chlorofil is almost

682
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,838
zero and during summer concentration

683
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:24,439
varies widely believe me it's not sloppy

684
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:28,199
lab stuff they're real variations in uh

685
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,079
chloride a chlorophyll during the summer

686
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,678
uh the other thing that I think is very

687
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,399
very important the phosphate dissolved

688
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,398
in the water has no important influence

689
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:40,559
on macrofit that is the so-called weeds

690
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:43,000
those big

691
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,159
things uh they're usually restricted to

692
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,960
the shallow water less than 68 MERS in

693
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,440
depth so a lot of people sort of think

694
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,838
oh that must be phosphorus in the

695
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,559
lake water that's influenced in the

696
00:34:54,838 --> 00:35:01,400
proliferation of those micrites well

697
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,199
some maybe but mostly they get their

698
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,680
phosphate from the

699
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,799
sediment so if you want to predict

700
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:12,000
future chlorophyll and algae

701
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:14,960
growth uh you can look at the phosphate

702
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,199
in the lake Source cooling water and I

703
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:23,519
presume Cornell will continue

704
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:27,159
to uh sample that water and we've seen

705
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:30,000
from past history what that deep water

706
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:33,519
concent ation of phosphate will do in

707
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,960
terms of chlorophyll in the lake so you

708
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:41,280
don't have to do all this stream

709
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:44,519
sampling uh just rely on Cornell to keep

710
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,880
monitoring the phosphate in the affluent

711
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:50,119
from course school if you don't like

712
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,280
Cornell data John hman atart William

713
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,640
Smith has collected and published

714
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,960
several years of data in far more detail

715
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,480
than the lak source cooling data so if

716
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,519
he continues his work we need Not

717
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,159
Duplicate

718
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:08,000
it with the future consultants and DEC

719
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:12,358
are will develop Lake and Watershed

720
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,358
models by 2 217 so they say there will

721
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:18,920
be a tmdl total maximum daily load

722
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:21,358
model I am the opinion that currently

723
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,680
the quality of the lake is very good to

724
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:27,719
excellent but the great challenge is

725
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:31,639
invas invasive species do we know how to

726
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:34,239
manage them oh very good thank you any

727
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:34,239
questions

728
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,599
comments this has been a production of
