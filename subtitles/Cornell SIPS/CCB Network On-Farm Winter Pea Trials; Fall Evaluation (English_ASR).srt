2
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,558
hi I'm sve I'm here at one of the

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,719
Cornell research Farms with my winter

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:20,719
pea plots that I planted about a month

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,879
ago I'm here to do my fall evaluations

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,278
which we're asking that you do four to 6

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,640
weeks after planting and before

8
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,599
snowfall we've had a really mild winter

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,280
here in Ithaca that's just starting to

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,719
break we had our first light frost last

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,160
night uh so we have vigorous plant

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,760
growth and lots to look at I want to

13
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,279
thank those of you who have shared

14
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,920
photos of your plots and your

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,200
experiences with planting and your

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
questions on the seed link uh social

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,760
feed uh it's really exciting to see

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,198
things coming up and it's cool to see uh

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,119
you guys interacting with one another as

20
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,358
well the first trait we're evaluating is

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,159
emergence we're using the germination

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,160
trait in seed link even though they're

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,238
not exactly the same thing but close

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,599
enough for our

25
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,640
purposes we're using the evaluation

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
rubric on page seven of your protocol

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,159
packet and using that we're asking what

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,200
percentage of the plot or what

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,359
percentage of the planted rows are

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,280
filled with plants as opposed to having

31
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,200
bare

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,200
soil so you will notice as we walked

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,600
down our plots we have some bare spots

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,400
like this um the beginning of the row on

35
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:31,919
this right hand side so we had an issue

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,680
with our planter where that cone was not

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,239
uh opening properly at the beginning of

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,159
our planting you see it gets better as

39
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,478
we go down the plot if you had an issue

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,200
like this whether it was a planter error

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,679
or your dog dug a hole in the middle of

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,920
the plot um please just rate the part of

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,640
the plot that was planted correctly if

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
the seed didn't get in the ground or got

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,960
dug up or something um you can ignore

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,159
that part of the

47
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,559
plot on the rubric emergence or

48
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,200
germination ratings range from one which

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,879
is less than 50% emerged to five which

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,800
is all or almost all plants emerged so

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,239
my plots look really good so I'm going

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,760
to be choosing from the top two ratings

53
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,400
so four which is more than 75% emerged

54
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,359
or five which is all or almost

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,560
all so for this row keep in mind we're

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
just rating the one row um there are a

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,120
couple of bare

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,039
spots including the space at the end

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,319
here

60
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,479
um so I'm going to say if I stacked all

61
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,119
that bare soil at one end I'd get maybe

62
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:42,238
15% of the row so for me this is going

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,080
to be a four this double row in contrast

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,519
is really nice and full there's maybe

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,800
one open spot there but I'm going to say

66
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,080
that all or almost all of the seeds that

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,640
we put in um have emerged so for me this

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,840
is going to be a

69
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:02,878
five for Vigor we are asking how vigor

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,519
ous how robust how fast growing

71
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,439
resilient to stress are the plants that

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,680
we're seeing so the scale runs from one

73
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,878
uh weak or slow growing plants to five

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,239
exceptional growth robust appearance we

75
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,318
need to remember that emergence and

76
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,840
vigor are different traits so if you

77
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,119
have a plot with not very good stand but

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,640
the plants that are there are healthy

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,560
and strong and and big uh that might

80
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,438
receive a good score for even though the

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,319
score for emergence is

82
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:39,959
lower so as I look across my plots I see

83
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,679
really nice Vigor across the board uh so

84
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,759
I will be choosing from the top couple

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,920
of ratings four which is strong growth

86
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,959
and five which is really exceptional

87
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,839
growth three of my varieties had growth

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,199
that was pretty comparable to this so

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,878
really nice and strong the tallest

90
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:02,560
plants are about uh 6 in tall uh very

91
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,479
full Lush looks really nice so this is

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,719
going to be a

93
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,919
four then compared to this which is my

94
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:13,199
four I'm going to come over

95
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,919
here to this plot which is even a little

96
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,918
more Lush so the plants are a little

97
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,238
taller maybe seven or 8 Ines for the

98
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,079
taller plants very well filled in um

99
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,799
this one really stood out in my plot so

100
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,079
I'm going to give this one of

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,160
five depending on which subset of

102
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,399
varieties you have you may or may not

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,960
see difference

104
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,638
in emergence or fall Vigor so if they

105
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,198
really do all look the same for one of

106
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,079
those traits it's okay to give them the

107
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,919
same rating we will or we won't see

108
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,599
differences later in the season but if

109
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,599
they look the same it's okay to score

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
them the same I've just been cutting

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,639
some peot samples to take down to J

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,280
Jason and Andrew at Stone Barnes and

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,000
blue hill at Stone Barnes so they can

114
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,159
give us some tips on tasting peash

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,519
shoots but I've been nibbling as I go

116
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,639
along and I'm finding some really

117
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:05,000
interesting differences in sweetness and

118
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,038
um kind of that rich starchy pea flavor

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,439
um and I wonder what else they will

120
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,240
taste and I wonder what you will all

121
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,319
taste when you um snack on your cover

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280
crops if you decide to hi I'm Jason

123
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,439
grower I'm the senior director of farm

124
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,198
and Innovation at the Stone Barn Center

125
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,279
and I'm Andrew lesmore I'm the director

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,720
of special projects at Blue hillt Stone

127
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,879
barns we're really excited to dive into

128
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,120
the tasting component of this winter pee

129
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,759
trial um blue hill and St Barnes have

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,280
engaging in cover crop trials both out

131
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,919
in the fields and in the kitchen for

132
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,359
tastings over many years and we're

133
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,680
really excited to be a part of this

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,639
project now with seed link and Cornell

135
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,918
and the expansive group of farmers that

136
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,120
are involved so as you are going out and

137
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:48,079
using seed link to evaluate the rest of

138
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,959
the plots we're going to be

139
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,800
incorporating two different flavor

140
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,638
traits into this analysis so there are

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,280
two different traits one of them is

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,240
Flavor the other one is texture both are

143
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,478
going to be rated on a scale through 1

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,918
through 5

145
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,318
Cornell and seing TB provides the rubric

146
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,758
for what each measurement looks like one

147
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,120
being unpleasant five being very very

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
delicious so you're going to be

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,319
inputting that into the app as you're

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,919
doing the rest of the work if you have

151
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,160
any questions feel free to reach out to

152
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,159
Jason or myself we'd love to help

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,840
thanks this is a production of corn
