00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:07,399
University hello my name is keny

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
Rodriguez I am a PhD student at Cornell

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,199
and I am with Steve reiners a

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,759
horiculture professor and Statewide

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,919
vegetabl specialist today we'll talk

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,600
about pollination so Steve we've um

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,560
talked about pollination and watermelon

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,278
and what that can do to that but are

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,799
there other effects of like pollination

11
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:28,118
in other curbit crops and how that

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,278
affect the fruit of the plant sure so

13
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,159
this is a great example this is cucumber

14
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:34,000
and you can see in this hand I've got a

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,159
cucumber very normally shaped this is

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,960
what you'd want um could grow maybe a

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,439
couple more days before we typically

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,399
Harvest it but it would be fine right

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,558
now and then you look at this one this

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,439
is from the same plant um and this one

21
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:49,238
is very crooked as compared to that and

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,439
the reason why is that is a pollination

23
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,119
issue um some bees did get over move

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,358
some pollen from the male flour to the

25
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,399
female flour and it was probably enough

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,600
to just get the fruit set and for it to

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,480
start to grow grow but we didn't have

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,439
nice uniformity with that with the

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,719
pollen in there so there's parts of it

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,399
that that weren't sort of fertilized so

31
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,200
that's what's leading to so if we cut

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,880
this open later on when the seeds

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
develop what we'd see is in the normal

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,359
Parts the seeds would be normal and

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
large and in here there probably

36
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,519
wouldn't be any seeds now for a home

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
Gardener these are fine to eat uh not a

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,920
problem at all taste would would be just

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,359
like a cucumber but if you're a

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,320
commercial grower you'd have a really

41
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,359
hard time trying to grow that and this

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,599
pollination issue that we see another

43
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,879
very common question we get from from

44
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,078
gardeners is they often will they've

45
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,000
read somewhere that again with the the

46
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,199
bees out in a curbing field they can

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,319
move the pollen from from one plant to

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,680
another what happens when they move that

49
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,758
pollen from a a cucumber to a melon or

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,560
from a melon to a squash well that cross

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,640
and then they might see something in

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,040
their Garden this year that looks odd

53
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,519
and they think it was because of the

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
Cross but let's talk about that um first

55
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,959
off

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,799
if in curbit

57
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,078
within pumpkins and squash uh winter

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,080
squash there can be some

59
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,000
cross-pollination that can occur but

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,800
it's impossible I'll repeat that again

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,878
it's impossible for a cucumber to cross

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,680
with a melon or a melon to cross with a

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:21,560
squash or for a pumpkin to to to to

64
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,159
cross with a watermelon it just cannot

65
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,920
happen in nature at all so

66
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,639
usually when you do see maybe a zucchini

67
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,159
that crosses with a pumpkin you won't

68
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,958
see that

69
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,519
change that year it will only be if you

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,400
save the seeds and where this can happen

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,560
sometimes is People are cleaning out

72
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,400
their Gardens in the in the fall and

73
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,959
they'll throw their old rotting squash

74
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,560
and things like that in the compost pile

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
and then they get a volunteer plant the

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,120
following year and it flowers and it

77
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,598
produces a fruit that looks a little bit

78
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,560
like a squash or pumpkin might look a

79
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,639
little bit like a zucchini sometimes we

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
call them sampkin sort the combination

81
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,719
but again it was from the seed it won't

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,640
it will not happen you will not see the

83
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,560
effects of that cross that first year

84
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,839
when it happens because what you're

85
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,680
seeing here what the what the outside of

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,878
this is all maternal tissue so it should

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,159
be whatever you planted um the seeds is

88
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,598
where the genetics have changed so if

89
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:18,318
you see that and something you've

90
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,679
planted this year and you say yeah but I

91
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,958
I planted the seed and I know it was a a

92
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,280
cucumber and it's come out weird it's

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,200
possible that there was a little mixup

94
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,640
at the seed company or maybe a mixup

95
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,798
when you were planting it themselves and

96
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,878
you put the wrong seed in but again you

97
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,239
won't see that unless you hold on to

98
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,438
those seeds for a year and plant them

99
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,640
out the following year Stephen just to

100
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:41,400
conclude so even if I see bees in my

101
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,958
field that doesn't mean that all the

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,239
flowers are going to get like pollinated

103
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,039
completely pollinated to get a good food

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,759
right uh yeah it actually takes I think

105
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,120
they've done some work in watermelons

106
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,878
where they think it might take anywhere

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,438
from 10 to 15 B visits um to move enough

108
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,639
pollen over to that flow so so even

109
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,078
though you think well there's bees there

110
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,878
you might even bring bees out a lot of

111
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,280
Growers will bring bees out into their

112
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,679
fields but they might go to other places

113
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,680
where they prefer the pollen source so

114
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,159
yeah so just because you see the bees

115
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,799
you want to see the bees but there's no

116
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,839
guarantee that they're as active as they

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,560
should in your curbit field yeah that's

118
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,518
very important to know so we just

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,120
learned about pollination how the food

120
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,639
can be me me shapen and also some

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,240
advices on like um how to uh check when

122
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,519
you have a cross but you know that you

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,478
will you won't have it in the first

124
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:36,120
season if you have your crop in um the

125
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,199
field this has been a production of
