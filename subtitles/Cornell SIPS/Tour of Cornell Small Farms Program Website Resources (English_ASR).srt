1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,960
University this is Anu rangarajan I am

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,800
the director of the small farm program

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,278
and I'm really excited to share with you

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,240
more about uh the program the kinds of

6
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,480
things that we do um and help you

7
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,479
understand a little bit more about the

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,960
way we sort of present ourselves in the

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,640
world but that's it's led to a little

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,280
bit of confusion so I'm hoping I can

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,000
clarify it so I just wanted to

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,679
uh give you

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,079
first I'm just trying to advance my

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,558
slides there we are um uh tell you about

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,719
the program itself and where we sit we

16
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,959
are in the College of agon Life Sciences

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,518
um our funding comes primarily through

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,239
small grants and large grants from the

19
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:04,198
USDA uh and we are supported um in part

20
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,599
uh with some funds from the college and

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,599
through Smith lever um what our goal is

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,919
and we were started in

23
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:16,319
2001 because at that time around the

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,478
country there was a tremendous um cry

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,519
out for greater attention to the needs

26
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,239
of small farmers uh this emerged from uh

27
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,920
the famous pford case in which USDA was

28
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,599
sued for not addressing the needs of

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,680
black farmers in the south so they

30
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,280
committed funding uh to develop small

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,118
farm programs across the country and

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,118
that is it's from there that the small

33
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:44,519
farm program was started I joined the

34
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:47,200
program as the Director in 2004 and have

35
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,879
totally enjoyed myself uh we have a

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
really great staff that I'll introduce

37
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,078
you to over the process of our call our

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
um webinar today but share with you

39
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,038
really the kinds of work that um we're

40
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,239
trying to do to enhance the viability of

41
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,519
small farms in New York the Northeast

42
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:07,158
and in fact now we're working nationally

43
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,318
so I think our strengths are really best

44
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,200
defined um through the way in which we

45
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,079
try to identify critical issues that are

46
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,238
affecting small farms and their

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
viability and then how we develop

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,039
collaborations to address those issues

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,239
uh we are uh always thinking about the

50
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,359
types of Publications or information

51
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,439
resources that will support small farm

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,080
development whether you are just

53
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,639
thinking about farming all the way to

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,440
where you've been farming for 20 years

55
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,518
and you're thinking you may want to rest

56
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,439
strategize your business or add new

57
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,360
Commodities uh we try to serve all those

58
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,359
Farms either from uh initial startup all

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,760
the way to when they're optimizing their

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,360
performance to developing a mature Farm

61
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:59,359
business so we are doing a lot of things

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,599
um at all of those points uh but I think

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
we're probably most known for our

64
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,878
beginning farmer support and so I'll be

65
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:11,598
sharing with you stuff about that but we

66
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:13,798
do um uh have a network of Educators in

67
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,759
across the state that have committed to

68
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,239
supporting small farm and new farm

69
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,919
development and in every County of the

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,920
state we have one individual who's

71
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,119
identified and I'm not sure um if any of

72
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,158
you are those folks but I would

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,360
encourage you to find out who because we

74
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:32,679
do send resources out to them and they

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,319
those Educators May in either in your

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,879
county or surrounding counties have

77
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,518
other resources locally to share around

78
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,518
small farm

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,040
development

80
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,919
so um I just thought I would back up and

81
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,079
tell you what is a small farm and uh the

82
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,479
USD da defines that as a farm that has a

83
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,439
gross annual revenue of less than

84
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,919
250,000 a year this number some people

85
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,959
are pushing on it thinking it should be

86
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,119
closer to 350 but this is where we're at

87
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,120
right now and you should know that 90%

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,079
of the farms in the country and in fact

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,920
in New York fit this

90
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,439
definition uh the most rapid growth in

91
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,438
farms at this point are those Farms that

92
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,000
are very small that may be grow seeing

93
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,680
less than $25,000 a year and this is

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,120
from the sort of energy that's been

95
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,160
focused on developing new Farms but

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,959
there's a lot of people and probably

97
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,600
many of the people that you work with

98
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,319
who um are really um just growing

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,960
something on a fairly small area and

100
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,159
selling it very locally and

101
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:39,839
supplementing their family income and

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,320
their own family food security so we are

103
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,719
thrilled and excited to help anyone who

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,439
wants to identify themselves as a farmer

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,919
and frankly the more people who call

106
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,000
themselves a farmer the better in my

107
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,680
book so um what we have observed that

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
you know most our farmers are really

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,319
diverse they are often Diversified

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,280
Vegetable Farms are Diversified across

111
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,599
um Enterprises so they may have mixes of

112
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,799
vegetables and poultry or beef and fruit

113
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,439
uh any combination honey um uh maple

114
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,240
syrup uh we have folks doing small scale

115
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,639
value added there's a huge diversity and

116
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,759
and I think a really optimistic and

117
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,478
positive sense of possibilities in our

118
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,479
small farm

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,038
sector so um a little bit more from uh

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,198
the people that we actually are able to

121
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:33,680
reach we have uh serve and I'll show you

122
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,560
how to join that where we share updates

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,639
every two weeks on important resources

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,959
or information that are of interest to

125
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,759
small

126
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,599
producers um but when we recently uh we

127
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,800
did a survey because we were trying to

128
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,080
understand more for example about where

129
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,199
do small farmers actually sell their

130
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,519
products and um I'm really sharing this

131
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,000
just again to drive home the point that

132
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,959
um when you look at the farm size they

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,918
are a majority of them are below 50

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,839
acres um and then even um the highest

135
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,079
percent of the people that answered our

136
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,359
call for information were farming less

137
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,359
than 5 acres and this again may be many

138
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,160
people you know and you work with and

139
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,038
again that gross revenue quite low um

140
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,120
the majority of the people that are

141
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:24,918
accessing and sort of communicating with

142
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,879
us um are making less than 25,000 a year

143
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:31,598
we do have Farms that are making more

144
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:34,240
than 250,000 a year uh and so while USDA

145
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,639
may not call them small um uh I think

146
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,639
that we create a home for them and I

147
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,038
tend to use a much more flexible

148
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,720
definition of what's a small farm and I

149
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,038
tell people that if you think you're a

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,360
small farm you are and the reason I say

151
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,560
that is it's really contextual and it's

152
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,038
a lot based on your community the people

153
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,519
you interact with and where you go to

154
00:06:54,038 --> 00:07:00,719
sort of find your um colleagues and so

155
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,758
we have some f farms for example that

156
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,759
may participate in a lot of our

157
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,800
programming that make well over 250,000

158
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,800
but they align with the values and the

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
sort of energy of the small farm

160
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:20,160
movement um Enterprises based on some uh

161
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,959
uh surveys that we've done recently

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,319
really focus heavily on poultry and

163
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,399
vegetables um again if you were even

164
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,479
thinking about starting a small farm

165
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,598
these are the easiest entry points as

166
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:35,120
well um the least amount of capital

167
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:38,598
required for getting into uh production

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,199
at a more commercial level um uh we tell

169
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,959
people at least $10,000 and some leased

170
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,319
land and you can and well- drained soil

171
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:50,799
ideally you can start a vegetable

172
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,639
operation um so uh this is just again to

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,639
give you a sense of where we're seeing

174
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,879
the energy and the sort of growth across

175
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,759
the state the majority of our Farms have

176
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,199
not been in business for that long and

177
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,120
this is part of a result of our new Farm

178
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,879
project which has been really out there

179
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,560
and recruiting people into the program

180
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,560
but over 60% of the people that we are

181
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,519
reaching are have been farming for less

182
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,800
than 10 years um but we do have quite a

183
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:23,120
few that are what we call the sort of

184
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
mature Farms over 15 years in

185
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,038
production that just uh really um I

186
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,638
wanted to just give you a little bit of

187
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,519
background on who we've been serving

188
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,680
traditionally and we know that that's

189
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,000
changing um and so we're developing

190
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:39,038
resources to address some of the changes

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,918
in that audience so I and the way that

192
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,759
um Lori and Jen had shared with me some

193
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,838
of your interest is that there may be

194
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,919
individuals you work with that um really

195
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,680
would love to scale up a little bit and

196
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,399
maybe add some income to their home and

197
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,359
or their youth and want to start some

198
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,519
kind of a business and experience what

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,159
that is to be an entrepreneur and I

200
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,879
think there's a tremendous amount of

201
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,278
energy um an excitement in the small

202
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,120
farm sector for entrepreneurs we know

203
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:10,078
for example that um the interest in

204
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,159
Local Foods is growing and that uh

205
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:15,519
there's a demand for uh farm products

206
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:18,919
and direct sales uh every year it

207
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,000
grows ideally we could dream of 25% of

208
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,479
all of our food being sourced locally in

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,240
time in Tomkins County we've achieve

210
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,839
that actually um uh but we when we think

211
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,240
about the rest of the country there's a

212
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,720
lot of challenges with that but we still

213
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,519
keep working towards it in New York

214
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,120
state um there's a growing number of

215
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,679
csas in farmers markets I'm sure you're

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,078
all familiar with these um but one thing

217
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,078
that we've faced with these is

218
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,640
um um is

219
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,360
that just a

220
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,078
second

221
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,639
um uh that there's some saturation

222
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:02,479
happening in these markets uh and so uh

223
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,360
we have found that some of our producers

224
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,639
are really interested in um new

225
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,440
wholesale markets that are sort of like

226
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,159
direct marketing but you're going direct

227
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,720
to a wholesale um institution so food

228
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,039
hubs are an example of that some

229
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,639
institutions are really interested in

230
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,078
buying uh direct uh groceries like

231
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,159
Wegman's and others and the Independent

232
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,679
Grocers are starting to enter the scene

233
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,480
of rying to provide easy to access

234
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,439
wholesale markets um and then rest rests

235
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,720
which have been a stronghold for many of

236
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,399
our small producers and so we see that

237
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,320
for entrepreneurs not only developing in

238
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,480
and creating products for direct markets

239
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,600
but also thinking about diversifying

240
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,759
their markets to include wholesale and

241
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,240
different sorts of strategies primarily

242
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,759
to manage risk and to ensure uh some

243
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,159
more Farm

244
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,799
security so a lot of our work and I'll

245
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,719
share with you some resources that are

246
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,278
emerging um to

247
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,480
support um

248
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:06,078
uh both uh the direct markets but really

249
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,639
the wholesale Market Readiness so here

250
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,919
is a list of different things I want to

251
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,799
share with you and I'm going to do this

252
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,319
primarily by doing a tour of the website

253
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,838
because if you haven't been to our

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
website it can be a little bit daunting

255
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,600
um because it there's a lot of

256
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,958
information there but I wanted to share

257
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,278
with you what I felt are really

258
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,879
important uh resources that you may need

259
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:30,399
to know

260
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:32,120
about um uh that can support your work

261
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,039
and and I'm hoping that uh We've

262
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,120
designed these really to help Educators

263
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,000
across the state um get Farms to do some

264
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,440
of the work on their own before they

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
start taking up a lot of your time so

266
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,120
keep that in mind we're trying to help

267
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,639
with designing materials that help you

268
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,720
be more efficient to give you easy to

269
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,159
access resources that you can share with

270
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,519
these new Farmers or small farms that

271
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,919
might come to you but then also we want

272
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,519
to hear from you what you feel our res

273
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,078
resources that you need um going forward

274
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:08,399
because that's where I think we can do a

275
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:11,039
lot to support your work so um I'm going

276
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,679
to shift now

277
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:20,039
to um uh the website and I hope you can

278
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,039
see this uh can everyone see this

279
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,560

this is a resource for example that's

288
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:56,198
been released um microloans um grazing

289
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,278

into this e newss um using this uh

298
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,039
template um we have a few questions we

299
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,599
like to know and I can even try to

300
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,919
extract from you the number of people

301
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,320
who are gardeners or home homesteaders

302
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,519
or aspiring Farmers that have been

303
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,839
subscribing to us if there was any

304
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,919
interest from you to know who that in

305
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,680
your own county is already um

306
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,198
interfacing with us um we also are

307
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,198
always really deeply interested and

308
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,439
committed to enhancing the diversity of

309
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,758
our audience and so we really ask and

310
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,519
hope that people can share with us uh

311
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,079
more about um uh their own backgrounds

312
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,679
and uh we are recently working really

313
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,879
hard to create create supportive

314
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,239
strategies for military veterans to come

315
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:08,320
into agriculture so we ask about um if

316
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,320
they can self-identify as a veteran and

317
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll share more about that so um again

318
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,360
um from the homepage across the top

319
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,159
there's a whole bunch of buttons here um

320
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,600
and I'm going to probe a few of those

321
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,559
I'm going to probe the quarterly a

322
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,120
little bit um share with you some more

323
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:27,638
about projects and

324
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:31,399
resources so um if we go if you go into

325
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,360
the resource tab you will find um some

326
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,759
of our most popular

327
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,278
guides and the first one I want to show

328
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,800
you is this guide to farming in New York

329
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:45,120
and we developed this years ago and this

330
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:47,278
is been one of our Flagship Publications

331
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,720
um from the guide to farming in New York

332
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,039
um if you get calls from individuals who

333
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,680
are either interested in farming or have

334
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,078
more questions about uh business

335
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,159
structure strategy marketing

336
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:00,958
considerations I would encourage you to

337
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,078
sort of spend some time at this website

338
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:07,679
and see what you can find here um we

339
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,879
have resources on developing a farm uh

340
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,919
for example uh different structures and

341
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,039
the issues that they are important and

342
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,519
these are all designed all of these fact

343
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:20,198
sheets are designed to be either

344
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,639
downloaded as a full guide or um you can

345
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:25,359
use them uh

346
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,560
independently and so um it tells you

347
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,759
when we've revised it and we actually

348
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,078
when there's new information we revise

349
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
every summer and so we have a whole

350
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,758
group of authors that have helped us

351
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,519
with this uh to revise it so here is an

352
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:42,360
example of the fact sheet for example on

353
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,879
Farm Insurance which will tell you the

354
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,399
issues around having supplemental or

355
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,120
product liability insurance and um in

356
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
basically information to really make

357
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,399
sure that small farmers are considering

358
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,720
risk management and how they're going to

359
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,720
protect themselves and their family so

360
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,440
um again this is is just the guide to

361
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,720
farming in New York has we did print it

362
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,079
at one time and um I when we printed I

363
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,240
think we handed out over 10,000 copies

364
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,120
and really the excitement for this came

365
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,600
from established Farms not just new

366
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,078
Farms there is information in here that

367
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,680
any farmer really needs to know about

368
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:26,359
and so uh definitely explore this guide

369
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,838
and um hopefully you will find it

370
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,639
interesting and helpful in the that

371
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,440
you're doing uh with gardeners who may

372
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,560
be wanting to scale

373
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,759
up and so um this particular resource is

374
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,719
just one of um several that I think are

375
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,199
important for you to know about I'm

376
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,160
going to dig in a little bit to the

377
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,078
urban guide in a minute well actually

378
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:52,439
I'll just do that right now so the urban

379
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,159
guide to farming we use the same model

380
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,959
of the guide to farming in New York but

381
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:00,719
here we're focused strictly on an urban

382
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:03,879
environment and in this case the uh

383
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,078
topics are different some are similar

384
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:10,439
but major and we encourage people to use

385
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:12,918
the the general guide as well but here

386
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,720
you may have some specialized issues for

387
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,160
example dealing with soil contamination

388
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,959
so this again is printable as a fact

389
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,160
sheet and you can use this to share with

390
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,480
somebody who's really interested in um

391
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,480
doing Urban farming or has a concern

392
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,319
about soil contamination there's a

393
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,919
tremendous number of resources that are

394
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,720
linked and we're currently in the middle

395
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,919
of doing a complete update of the guide

396
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,440
and adding a few nor more sections uh

397
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,400
the sections that we want to add are um

398
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,120
uh focused in on mushrooms and Agro

399
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,759
forestry as well as some more dive down

400
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:55,119
into Hydroponics and and these new sort

401
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,119
of vertical farming strategies that

402
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,158
everybody seems to be excited

403
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,879
about um so that's a bit more about the

404
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,840
two guides to farming these other

405
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,720
resources are um the on Farm if you have

406
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,839
people doing poultry this on Farm

407
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,960
poultry Slaughter this was driven by a

408
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,558
liability insurance issue where a bunch

409
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,319
of farmers were calling us and saying

410
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,319
they do not they're getting cancelled

411
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,960
from insurance policies and that was a

412
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,879
big concern to us so we acted very

413
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,480
quickly to respond to that working with

414
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,679
insurance companies to create what we

415
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,679
felt were guidelines to support Safe

416
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,120
Handling on farms for poultry Slaughter

417
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,960
um and because there's an exemption

418
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,399
under a thousand Birds we want to make

419
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,759
sure that people are are really um if

420
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
they're doing it on farm that they're

421
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,359
considering all of the components of uh

422
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,239
setting up a good system that's both

423
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,079
efficient for them for labor and safe

424
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,599
for the quality of the birds they're

425
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,519
producing um there's an online course

426
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,399
that complements this and Lyn Biven has

427
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,918
been a real leader for us and she's out

428
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,880
in Western New York and an extension

429
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,480
educator another important guide

430
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,280
um is the guide to direct farming of

431
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,400
livestock and poultry now this is a this

432
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:08,720
is a guide that's a little bit outdated

433
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,559
but Martha and Tatiana have agreed to

434
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,480
help us with updating this and so we're

435
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,720
hoping that this coming summer we can

436
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,919
actually update the guide but this has

437
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,079
probably been one of our most

438
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,759
popular um uh resources that we've

439
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,678
produced because there's so many

440
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,440
questions around both slaughterhouses

441
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,720
and processing um regulations and then

442
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,400
how to handle and direct Market poultry

443
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,279
and livestock so I wanted to make sure

444
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,679
you knew about

445
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:41,839
that um and so that really gives you um

446
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:47,280
a few of the overviews um as far as

447
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:48,839
timely information it really is um uh

448
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,319
through

449
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,359
um I'm sorry I'm trying to get to the

450
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:58,759
page

451
00:19:53,359 --> 00:20:02,558
here um it's through our um

452
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:05,319
uh small our our our update and so

453
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:08,319
please do sign up for the update these

454
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,519
are every two weeks and if you haven't

455
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,439
been receiving them but there's a ton of

456
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:16,879
resources that we both share on our

457
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,080
website home page uh but we also have

458
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,480
these inside

459
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:25,759
um uh in the updates that are come as an

460
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,279
email I'm trying to

461
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:33,000
um remember I think um here is the list

462
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,000
of the archives under our news button

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,319
and so you can see for example if you

464
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,919
open up one uh the one that happened

465
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,599
last the most recent one one of our

466
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,000
recent ones it tells you uh both

467
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,480
different things to be happening um at

468
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,599
Cornell different announcements and then

469
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,400
events that people should know about and

470
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,279
then uh some job opportunities we get a

471
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,759
lot of people sharing job opportunities

472
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,839
with us and then grants and so this is

473
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,279
our way of trying to provide timely

474
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,599
information to individuals who um uh you

475
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,079
know people that are developing their

476
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,918
Farms looking for

477
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:12,839
support so um again I really do

478
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:15,520
encourage you to join and get the the uh

479
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:18,839
update the other Flagship publication

480
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,798
for us is our small farm quarterly and

481
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,558
so this is a quarterly magazine and I'm

482
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,798
not sure if any of you have ever written

483
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,599
for it but we would welcome submissions

484
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,278
because our editorial team is made up of

485
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:34,119
mostly you Educators from around the

486
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:36,400
state who help us um and they provide

487
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,639
articles or they recruit writers for the

488
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,720
Articles um this is an entirely

489
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,400
volunteer publication um we're lucky to

490
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,839
have a nice partnership with uh Le

491
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,840
Publications who put out country folks

492
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,119
and so we generate all of the content

493
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:54,798
and they do the printing and um put it

494
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:57,639
in uh to the country folks as an insert

495
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:00,720
so it goes to over 30,000 families

496
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,799
across the Northeast um but what's

497
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,240
exciting here is that you know anywhere

498
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,359
in our website you can search a topic so

499
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,359
for example if if you were interested in

500
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:14,079
grazing you could hit that and what it

501
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,319
would do is basically give you a list of

502
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:20,399
a bunch of the different articles um uh

503
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:24,240
that we have uh both on in the quarterly

504
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,320
historically uh this top one is about um

505
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,798
uh grazing online course which I'll tell

506
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,678
you about a little bit more um you can

507
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,038
just click on it it will pop you to the

508
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,679
article that was written by Nancy Glazer

509
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:40,278
educator in Western New York talking

510
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,880
about um renting grazing land and so

511
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:43,759
this was originally published in the

512
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,600
quarterly but we want to make sure that

513
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:49,519
all of these are available for folks

514
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,119
going forward and then you can see here

515
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,839
in that same issue there was a whole

516
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,239
bunch of other articles that may be of

517
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,240
interest to

518
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:03,839
you um

519
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,840
so uh I think let me just double check

520
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:16,000
here so over time um we have always

521
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:19,759
struggled because as I've described uh

522
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,119
small farms are really diverse and uh

523
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,798
how do you pick where to sort of focus

524
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:26,359
your efforts and trying to support the

525
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:30,558
development of such a diverse sector of

526
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:33,119
our farm our farm fing culture so um

527
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,399
because of that what we have done every

528
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:39,639
other year is we host what we call a

529
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,640
small farm Summit and that Summit uh we

530
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,960
recruit broadly across the state using a

531
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,240
webinar type format and so we'll have up

532
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,880
to seven or eight sites around the state

533
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,000
where we ask producers to gather along

534
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,520
with those interested in their success

535
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,400
so Educators uh we get members of

536
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,798
different nonprofits uh Soil and Water

537
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,159
and our CS uh all sorts of folks would

538
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:06,158
Gather in these different locations and

539
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,360
then what we try to do is really focus

540
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,400
on helping them help asking them to help

541
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,119
us

542
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,880
prioritize uh the directions that a

543
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,759
program like this should take and we ask

544
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,840
them to gather in regions because it's

545
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,158
really important to us that we're always

546
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,278
cultivating uh regionally strong

547
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,039
collaboration and so but getting people

548
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:31,000
into the room is so much more important

549
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,720
I think than anything that we do um and

550
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,839
that's the hardest thing in our culture

551
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,558
now is to actually have people feel like

552
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,000
they develop meaningful relationship so

553
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,839
we have uh intentionally designed the

554
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
summit even though it's only every two

555
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:48,879
years we're hoping that we can um uh

556
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,359
really uh help people connect with those

557
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,760
around them that can

558
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:58,398
help we in 2012 we at we actually had a

559
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,119
survey and we had over 700 small Farmers

560
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,719
respond to help us prioritize where they

561
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,678
thought uh are the real opportunities to

562
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,278
enhance the viability of small farms and

563
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,798
the top five that came out of that was

564
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,759
distribution to reach local

565
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,839
markets um uh figuring out how to do

566
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,038
this how to help small producers no

567
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,398
matter the scale actually get themselves

568
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,038
into local and Regional markets more

569
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,519
effectively and more

570
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,759
efficiently uh economic impact of small

571
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,278
farms on communities this is like a huge

572
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,599
huge question uh we have all these small

573
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:37,119
farms and um that are supporting local

574
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,278
food and hiring local kids and and what

575
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,639
is the impact of them on their farms and

576
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,278
interesting I found it really

577
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,799
interesting that this was the second

578
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:47,519
priority from a farm

579
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,599
community uh helping deal with livestock

580
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,558
processing issues how do we identify

581
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,959
where they should be and who and how do

582
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,079
we expand or improve our access to those

583
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,600
processing facilities financing and then

584
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,158
greater invest investment in research

585
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,398
and extension and other services so this

586
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,240
is just giving you a flavor of the kinds

587
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:07,599
of information we get when we ask

588
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,159
farmers where should we

589
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,639
focus but the but one of the things that

590
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,120
I found really interesting is we asked

591
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,480
Farm uh small farmers you know where do

592
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,918
they see themselves going in two years

593
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,399
as far as the new ways they want to

594
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,600
Market and what I want to highlight is

595
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:26,759
this growth and interest in

596
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,398
wholesale and in two years a bunch

597
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,599
currently the major maity of our farmers

598
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,519
are using Farm stands or farm markets

599
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,719
and

600
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:38,798
csas um and all of these ups as their

601
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,839
primary direct channels in the way that

602
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,000
they share their products but um this

603
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,480
idea of selling to restaurants and food

604
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,440
hubs and

605
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,640
groceries uh has really um been

606
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,919
interesting and exciting and we have

607
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,880
some very small producers in the state

608
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,440
who are doing this and and finding that

609
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,360
they're being really successful

610
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,240
so one of the things that we've done as

611
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:07,240
a program is invest in developing a

612
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,359
curriculum to treat to help new

613
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,000
producers or existing Farmers become

614
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:16,038
more wholesale Market ready and we're

615
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,839
rolling this out on April 18th and 19th

616
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:21,278
it's a two-day inservice your colleagues

617
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,959
are the instructors we have folks from

618
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,079
across the state that have worked with

619
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,079
us uh to develop this and uh Violet

620
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,720
Stone in our program has been leading

621
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:34,278
this effort and the the materials will

622
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,480
help producers make decisions on how to

623
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,359
shift to a wholesale Market how do they

624
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,000
match their production to the demands of

625
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,879
these markets um what's the culture

626
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,599
among these different types of markets

627
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,600
and then how do we figure out how to

628
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:49,558
work together and Foster these

629
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:51,678
opportunities in within regions so

630
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,879
that's just really more of a teaser and

631
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,640
something I want you to be aware of this

632
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,640
is a professional development

633
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,519
opportunity the people that we want to

634
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,480
have attend are people like you

635
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,399
Educators around the state who may be

636
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,360
getting these kinds of questions or

637
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,639
anticipate that it may become a bigger

638
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:13,278
part of their

639
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:15,960
work so uh just to put that in mind um

640
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,200
as you uh in your planning and if it's

641
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,840
something that's of interest to you so

642
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,880
what I'd like to do now is go back again

643
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:31,319
to our website and share um a couple of

644
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:34,919
more uh res sources so uh this is that

645
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:37,000
wholesale marketing piece uh baskets to

646
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,759
pallets preparing small and midsize

647
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,359
Farms enter food hubs cooperatives

648
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,079
restaurants and groceries um and so this

649
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,240
is the basis of it we do have a

650
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,720
wholesale market watch and a list serve

651
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
that you can sign up and we share

652
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,798
information about that we've also had a

653
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,919
series of webinars that if you're really

654
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,038
curious about understanding what small

655
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,840
farms are interested in this I would

656
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,480
encourage you to go and take a look at

657
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:02,359
some of these webinars where different

658
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,360
Farmers have shared with us their

659
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,278
transition from direct to wholesale and

660
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,199
you would be surprised how small some of

661
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,200
these Farms

662
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,519
are um and so we have a big group of

663
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,960
folks and this is the group of your

664
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,278
colleagues that have been helping to

665
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,440
write this curriculum so uh stay tuned

666
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,640
uh I hope it's something that you would

667
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,759
might be interested in going

668
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,480
forward so there's a few other uh things

669
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:34,200
that are happen at the program and

670
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,599
um uh What uh are other areas that I

671
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,880
can't really dig into with you right now

672
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,519
um but I just wanted you to know about

673
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,760
our we have a whole new effort focused

674
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,759
on helping farmers who are interested in

675
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:52,119
grazing um and so we have a grazing

676
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:54,679
initiative um and we also have a program

677
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:56,839
that's focused quite heavily on tillage

678
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,120
and soil Health Management for small

679
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,558
producers

680
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:02,759
so those are two um projects that are

681
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,038
really specific and really focus on a

682
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,720
particular sector and we do take these

683
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:12,119
things on

684
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,480
periodically I want to focus in on the

685
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:19,678
um uh our beginning farmer project the

686
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:24,278
Northeast beginning farmer project so um

687
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:27,798
this actually emerged from all of you uh

688
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:30,359
in 2006 we kept getting

689
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:32,158
uh we started having conversations with

690
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,599
Educators that we were connected with

691
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,399
and and uh and they kept saying you know

692
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,918
I cannot believe the number of people

693
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:40,678
coming to me with the interest in

694
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,840
starting a farm and I don't know how to

695
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,519
respond and then what we observed is

696
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,558
that everybody around the state was so

697
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,640
busy creating their own curricula and

698
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:51,000
trying to put together their own

699
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
materials and it seemed like a kind of a

700
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,398
crazy waste of a lot of people's time to

701
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,599
not have a centralized resource and so

702
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,959
that's when we really brought together a

703
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:03,839
team of Educators and created the

704
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,600
beginning farmer project our vision is

705
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,439
that every new farmer in New York has

706
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,558
access to the support information and

707
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,038
training they need to be successful like

708
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:14,000
that's our mission and we wanted to be

709
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,960
that anyone who wants to farm regardless

710
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,079
of where they're at can do this and have

711
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,120
people that can help them with it so um

712
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,119
uh in order to do that what we have

713
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,759
really done and worked really hard as I

714
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,798
mentioned is create

715
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,240
um small farm and beginning farmer

716
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,679
contacts within every CCE office around

717
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,880
the state and we are welcome to add you

718
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,120
to our list online of references at our

719
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,278
homepage there's a who can help Tab and

720
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,719
uh you can and we are happy to make sure

721
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,839
that you're listed there we've also in

722
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,880
our work cultivated a network of

723
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,079
organizations in New York and the

724
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,200
Northeast that specifically support New

725
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,678
farmers so it's not just extension

726
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,519
Educators that are out there doing this

727
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,559
work we have a a bunch of nonprofits we

728
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,638
have incubator Farms we have all sorts

729
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,359
of people that are really passionate

730
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,759
about helping people start farming um

731
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,839
and so what we try to do um through the

732
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,720
small farm program is professional

733
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,439
development for those

734
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,440
individuals to try to make sure that uh

735
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,880
the Educators and those that are

736
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,759
supporting earm development really have

737
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,440
connection to the best resources

738
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:26,359
information materials to make their jobs

739
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,960
easier so we really do see ourselves

740
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:31,359
both as we provide information and

741
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,519
resources directly to new producers but

742
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,558
then we want to cultivate a learning

743
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,919
community among the Educators that are

744
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,480
working in this area and so we have met

745
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,120
annually we call it the beginning

746
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,399
farming Learning Network and we usually

747
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,879
meet at the Sentry house around uh end

748
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,759
of October uh up in Albany because

749
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,840
that's actually 6 hours from everywhere

750
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,359
in the Northeast believe it or not and

751
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:58,359
so we uh have do um an inservice

752
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,798
training and I think I don't know if any

753
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,278
of you have been there um but uh it's

754
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,319
actually usually a really Dynamic and uh

755
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,440
fun Gathering where we're learning from

756
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:11,678
each other how to do this

757
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,759
work so um uh I'm just going to review

758
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,278
with you just quickly um some of the

759
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,919
offerings we have online courses these

760
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:22,079
are six week non-credit classes and we

761
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:24,960
have currently uh I think we're up to 17

762
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:28,879
classes we've had over 1300 people go

763
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,558
into these classes and uh uh 42% report

764
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,720
increasing their own Revenue in their

765
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:36,720
Farm after taking these classes and so

766
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,839
these are again facilitated primarily by

767
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,120
extension Educators who have developed a

768
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,519
passion for working with new farms uh

769
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,199
the the model that we're using is that

770
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,278
um people are paying for these and we're

771
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,000
paying Educators to help teach them um

772
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:55,759
and then it also covers them uh the

773
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,038
administrative management which is a ton

774
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,200
of administrative stuff that has to

775
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:03,359
happen behind the scenes with this for

776
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,399
Erica frene and um so she's been our

777
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:09,398
real um uh Shepherd for the online

778
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,039
courses one of our staff members uh but

779
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:14,239
we are always looking for new

780
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,800
instructors so just so you know that um

781
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,959
uh and then I'm going to take you on a

782
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,919
tour of uh some of our res resources on

783
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,679
the website um and so let me do that

784
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,519
right

785
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,800
now

786
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:31,800
um there we are

787
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,599
so the uh um this Pro this website

788
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,599
currently is separate from the small

789
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,320
farm program website and that's caused

790
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,760
some confusion the reason we created a

791
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,200
separate website was partly because some

792
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,280
of our funding we needed to have a place

793
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:52,078
to keep a lot of materials um but it

794
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,560
also it it has had such an energy and

795
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,119
drive the development of the uh

796
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,358
beginning farmer project and the tools

797
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,480
and the resources that it was a lot to

798
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:04,279
manage but I do want to give you the

799
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,199
heads up that we are imagining bringing

800
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,800
the two sites back together going

801
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,279
forward because a lot of the new Farms

802
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,000
that we've been cultivating are actually

803
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,760
hitting the point where they really are

804
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,480
more established and are going to need a

805
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,839
different kind of support so we are

806
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,358
tooling up for

807
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:25,000
that so um one of the things that uh I

808
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:27,799
just realized that I

809
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,320
cannot get past this little sharing my

810
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:35,400
monitor screen okay

811
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,079
so um I think that this question about

812
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,519
where do you start um well I guess

813
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,839
there's getting started so um these what

814
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:49,199
we have created is um this um section

815
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,838
called plan your farm and so this portal

816
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,159
and basically collection of resources is

817
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:58,358
really there to help someone who wants

818
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:01,358
to work on their own start to get into

819
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:03,400
uh thinking about is farming for me uh

820
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,960
what Commodities do I want to do how am

821
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,079
I going to do the planning uh for this

822
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,679
farm so it's a whole series of

823
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,280
worksheets that you can do with somebody

824
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,440
or you can send them there and say just

825
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,280
um start to do your own thinking and

826
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,440
planning and it's done using a sort of

827
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,160
question narrative where people can

828
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,119
actually go through and get some

829
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,399
guidance as to how to narrow down um

830
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,640
what do I need to know how do I finance

831
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,000
it or can I get a grant um and so uh

832
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,838
these are structured as

833
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,280
tutorials so for example in this

834
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:44,799
tutorial on goals and skills what's

835
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,640
really interesting is we complement both

836
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,318
the written material with videos of

837
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:52,879
farmers and New farmers around the

838
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,599
around the state who really have been

839
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,559
able to clearly

840
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,519
articulate um some of the um uh issues

841
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,639
and the strategies that have helped them

842
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,838
be

843
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:07,000
successful and so the I would definitely

844
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:10,599
send somebody to this planning your farm

845
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,280
Hub as a place to get started um and one

846
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,559
of the challenges I think that all of

847
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,480
you may face is people you know they

848
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,880
want someone to sometimes hold their

849
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,119
hand and I would encourage you to push

850
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,880
back and say show me what you can do and

851
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,119
they yeah they totally I just see a

852
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,599
comment from Jen that they want us to do

853
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,720
it and and it's um and I think that uh

854
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,318
you know farming as an entrepreneur is

855
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:37,959
an individualized action and starting

856
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,759
with information um and uh giving them

857
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,760
we're hoping this portal helps you say

858
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,240
look dig this is your project here's

859
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,760
where you get started and hopefully you

860
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,399
can use some of these um you can point

861
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,440
people to some of these resources that

862
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,240
I've shared with you to help them start

863
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,119
thinking about farming but what we know

864
00:37:54,239 --> 00:38:00,838
is you know doing this kind of stuff

865
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:03,240
online is really um uh in some ways for

866
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,480
a certain kind of learner and we know we

867
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,959
have lots of different Learners and we

868
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,400
have some people that just don't even

869
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,599
want to do online teaching and so we um

870
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,720
have encouraged and support and worked

871
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,039
with a network of uh Educators around

872
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:19,279
the state who do these so you want to

873
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,400
farm type workshops and if you haven't

874
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,119
done one of those or you're interested I

875
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,200
would encourage you to go to the who can

876
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,400
help tab here and I and if you don't

877
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:30,480
know who else is doing it in your area

878
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,800
but I bet you could find somebody

879
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,240
locally if you're not aware of them who

880
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,359
is doing these types of trainings within

881
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:40,879
a several County area so um don't start

882
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,880
from scratch don't feel like you have to

883
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,160
do this yourself and if you aren't able

884
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,880
to find someone just send us a note give

885
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,440
uh send me or Erica an email and we will

886
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,800
try to connect you with people who can

887
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,800
help you um figure out how to address

888
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,880
this

889
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,160
need so um uh so these worksheets are

890
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,000
really meant to be a self-guided uh

891
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:06,719
process for planning uh a farm startup

892
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,199
but I what's become our real Flagship is

893
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,480
our online

894
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:14,199
courses and so we have a a whole a bunch

895
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,079
of online courses and we're actually

896
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,439
going to be restructuring the way we

897
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,599
present them because there's it's a bit

898
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,318
overwhelming and people are telling us

899
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,318
like I don't know which to take first

900
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:26,960
and I don't know how to approach it but

901
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:29,759
none of these have prere requisites

902
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,159
they're six week uh

903
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,760
facilitated um uh courses that help you

904
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,279
understand all the aspects of getting

905
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,599
into farming square one one of our most

906
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,560
popular classes is the very first class

907
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,640
like is farming for me you know uh what

908
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,119
are your own motivations um what

909
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,838
resources do you have um what might fit

910
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,760
you as far as an Enterprise these are

911
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:57,039
the kinds of questions that are

912
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,200
addressed in square one and and it could

913
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,000
be a place where you direct people who

914
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,799
come to like I I'm thinking I'd like to

915
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,119
start a farm it's like go do this think

916
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,160
uh go through the process take this

917
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,720
course um and then uh let's talk after

918
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,679
that and so again it's not about uh

919
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,118
dismissing them but trying to help them

920
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:19,679
help themselves and so we've uh

921
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,680
structured these classes to be

922
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,679
interactive um there's a tremendous

923
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,639
number of resources that people have

924
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,559
access to uh there's often two people

925
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,598
that are

926
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:34,960
teaching uh together um there's some

927
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,960
Basics about H how this class is

928
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:43,400
structured um uh one of our new classes

929
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:45,279
um that keeps filling up and it's really

930
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,680
interesting is Farm scale mushroom

931
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,599
cultivation and Steve Gabriel who's on

932
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:53,118
our staff now um has been teaching this

933
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:57,079
and every time he he's offered it twice

934
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:00,039
and and it fills up each time 50 people

935
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,760
and there's a waiting list so um there's

936
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,559
a lot of excitement and interest in

937
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,560
something like mushrooms um and whether

938
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,559
they're growing it on logs or they're

939
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,279
using other enterpr other strategies

940
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,279
with bags um this is a a class that um

941
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,160
if you're it's an unusual class and it's

942
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,599
an unusual crop uh but we do find a lot

943
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,719
of interest so I wanted to make sure you

944
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:26,359
were aware of

945
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:28,719
that so part another part of um the uh

946
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:32,239
online courses and something that's been

947
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:35,838
really helpful I'm just trying to find

948
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:39,759
um is our voices of experience

949
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,960
videos and so um again another way of

950
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,440
helping people learn is by is by

951
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,960
learning

952
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,400
stories uh is by um uh seeing stories

953
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,159
and learning from other farmers and so

954
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,358
we started building this video

955
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:56,519
collection in 2008 I believe and we had

956
00:41:54,358 --> 00:42:00,318
some funding from USDA as well as from

957
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:02,440
Farm viability to do this and we have a

958
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:06,039
whole collection of videos on our

959
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:09,358
YouTube channel so uh it's YouTube

960
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:12,759
Cornell small farms and for

961
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:15,759
example um there's I'm not sure if you

962
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,920
can hear this or not but here's one from

963
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Black

964
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,720
Diamond uh these videos

965
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,880
are uh some of them have been like this

966
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,679
one on cting pigs I can't believe how

967
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,039
many people have watched this

968
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:33,879
and so um but um these are some Farms

969
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:36,800
that are in and around itha um uh but

970
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,000
they represent really Diversified farms

971
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,359
and they represent different

972
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,519
perspectives on how how to do the work

973
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,519
and so they include um videos about the

974
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,599
farmer themselves sort of how they

975
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,000
approach different activities how they

976
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,200
may market and then we have a couple of

977
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,440
new ones at the bottom on draft horses

978
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:59,519
Don Hughes who's here uh locally has

979
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,039
started the draft animal power uh dap

980
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,719
Network and has been committed to draft

981
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,880
animal work and we are seeing more and

982
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,480
more people expressing interest in draft

983
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,400
animals so we wanted to connect them to

984
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,800
that so there are so many videos that

985
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,920
organized different ways um here's just

986
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,760
a an there's um I can't even remember

987
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,159
how many videos we have on here now um

988
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,520
but there's different projects as well

989
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,279
um and different videos that we've

990
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,719
brought in for example we have a video

991
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,880
here on Farm Service Agency

992
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,159
microloans um because there's a lot of

993
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,920
people that are interested in that

994
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:37,598
program to start a small operation so

995
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,680
understanding what the issues are um

996
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,680
we've also had um a program for

997
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:44,719
educators uh that was focused on

998
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:47,639
cultural competency for new farm

999
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,480
development and we heard from two uh uh

1000
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:54,279
leaders um uh two individuals who are

1001
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,480
leading uh local nonprofits uh small

1002
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,119
nonprofits um and how they're addressing

1003
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,519
issues of diversity in their programming

1004
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,200
and what were some of the challenges

1005
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,480
that they faced um in working across uh

1006
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,480
difference so there's all sorts of

1007
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,480
different um materials here on the

1008
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,440
program but I um on small farm startup

1009
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,800
as well as you know how to build hoop

1010
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,679
houses and um uh just lots of different

1011
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,839
things so I would encourage you to

1012
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:25,000
explore the uh Video Collection um

1013
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:28,679
farming in

1014
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,880
action so I think then um the other

1015
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:34,000
resources that I wanted to point you to

1016
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,760
are again on that homepage um um if you

1017
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,800
look across the top of the beginning

1018
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,760
farmer project there's we've gone

1019
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,839
through the uh tutorials the online

1020
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,119
courses um there's uh also then um these

1021
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:51,519
resources the videos the guides and then

1022
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,800
we have these articles that come from

1023
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,519
small farm

1024
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,400
quarterly but we have wanted to collect

1025
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,559
them together together in a way that's

1026
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,358
um these articles then represent

1027
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,599
different aspects of getting started in

1028
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:06,239
farming and again another way who for

1029
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,400
people who are interested in just

1030
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,039
hearing stories and learn best by

1031
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,240
stories and so these are written by A

1032
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,159
diversity of individuals some Educators

1033
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:17,558
some

1034
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:19,519
farmers who um uh and then we have a lot

1035
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,280
of profiles of New farmers here at the

1036
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:26,480
bottom as well so I would again um

1037
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,319
consider this another resource uh

1038
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,519
to help you uh help people think through

1039
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,119
whether or not getting into farming is

1040
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,119
something for

1041
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:42,800
them um and one other piece I haven't

1042
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,160
really alluded to it in too much but

1043
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,880
there is a whole bunch of

1044
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:50,480
information that is buried in these

1045
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,559
sites that we consider like the farmer's

1046
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,920
bookshelf and these are linked sometimes

1047
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:58,359
to online resources or how to find them

1048
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,159
but I in both the beginning farmer site

1049
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:04,039
as well as the Cornell small farm

1050
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:06,399
program site you will find resources

1051
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:08,599
tremendous numbers of resources that are

1052
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,079
available in the case of the small farm

1053
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:14,359
site this is where we really try to

1054
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:17,160
focus in on uh resources for um

1055
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:20,000
established Farmers for example in

1056
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:22,399
production you can see that we have this

1057
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,679
wide array of materials that have been

1058
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,000
collected

1059
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,598
together and so these aren't the only

1060
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,639
materials out there but there just a few

1061
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,960
that we felt were really good or well

1062
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,960
done or easily accessible online again

1063
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,440
something that you might be able to use

1064
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,760
in your own work to share information

1065
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,000
with individuals who come to you

1066
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,079
directly or even to be able to forward

1067
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,440
them to some of these resources so they

1068
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,720
can explore on their own so it's both

1069
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,960
the learning information but then kind

1070
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:54,159
of the diagnosis and the support for

1071
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,760
decision

1072
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,719
making and I think that's the piece

1073
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,640
that's critical for us is how do you

1074
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:05,598
support good decisionmaking on farms and

1075
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,279
so some of our online courses are

1076
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,480
related directly to decision making for

1077
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,240
example we have a course on holistic

1078
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,159
management which is the entire framework

1079
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:17,239
for decision making in which you really

1080
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,679
consider environment economics and

1081
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:22,239
social goals that you might have as an

1082
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,078
individual or a farmer you can apply the

1083
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,399
decision-making framework to your life

1084
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,200
in general it doesn't have to be for

1085
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,559
agriculture um but that's an example of

1086
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,118
something that we feel is really

1087
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,200
important it's not just technical

1088
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,079
information it's really the how do you

1089
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,679
put it all together and how do you put

1090
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,000
it together in a way that feeds your

1091
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:44,519
soul felds your feeds your energy and

1092
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,440
really plays to your skills and so we

1093
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,318
try to think about all of that the soft

1094
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,800
skills development as well as the

1095
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,279
technical skills

1096
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,000
development um but this whole piece of

1097
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,680
scaleup so um and I think this may be

1098
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,679
relevant to to some of you is you know

1099
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,000
we recognize that it's a real trick to

1100
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,598
go from you know growing at a very small

1101
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,880
scale and then wanting to really

1102
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,800
actually change your practices and move

1103
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,920
into something at a larger scale and a

1104
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,359
more commercial scale so we do have some

1105
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,000
Advanced Enterprise online courses that

1106
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,199
are designed for supporting Farm

1107
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
diversification um well the mushroom one

1108
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,679
is one for example but we have a high

1109
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,039
tunnel class that's starting um shortly

1110
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,759
we have both vegetable and Berry produ

1111
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,079
classes that are online to give people

1112
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,559
the start or deepen their skill sets

1113
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,160
around those two production systems we

1114
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,960
have a grazing course um all of these

1115
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,719
are meant to sort of help with the scale

1116
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,838
up um and we're going to be adding food

1117
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:45,239
safety um and even adapting to climate

1118
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:47,318
change so these are some of the courses

1119
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:52,239
that we're adding that are really meant

1120
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:55,400
to help deal with scale up and um but uh

1121
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,719
we our current profunding supports also

1122
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,880
we we have funding from the USDA to help

1123
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,639
those individuals who are maybe 3 to 5

1124
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,119
years in and want to rest strategize and

1125
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:08,480
what we're actually doing is um helping

1126
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,200
Farms create what we call profit teams

1127
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,798
and these are teams of Consultants uh

1128
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,318
often extension Educators who they hire

1129
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,280
to help them improve their own

1130
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,039
entrepreneurship business training and

1131
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,079
planning and help them make decisions

1132
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:26,239
really important decisions to grow the

1133
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:28,798
business and so we have funding each of

1134
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,159
the Farms who participate get $2,000 as

1135
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:33,358
a grant and then they have to commit 500

1136
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,960
of their own funds so they have $2,500

1137
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,358
to work with over 18 months to pay

1138
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,440
people to consult with whether that's a

1139
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:42,199
feed um a person to help them with their

1140
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,358
nutrition plan if it's someone to help

1141
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,798
them with their disease management plan

1142
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:48,798
if it's about how do I improve the

1143
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:51,400
quality for a wholesale Market it's up

1144
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:53,838
to the farmer what we want to know is

1145
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,519
that how they really feel and and all we

1146
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,920
care is that they find the right people

1147
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:00,440
people to help them take the business to

1148
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,200
the next level so this is very much

1149
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,318
one-on-one

1150
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,358
Consulting um and then the other thing

1151
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,159
we're doing is developing these sort of

1152
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:11,719
intensive training programs that will be

1153
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:13,399
um on scaling equipment this is

1154
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:15,558
something that's really tricky to go

1155
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,680
from a very small scale even to move

1156
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:21,640
from sort of less than a half an acre to

1157
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:24,318
one acre to 5 acres and then to 10 like

1158
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:26,239
there's tend to be breaks there like um

1159
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,480
well actually at over acres and then

1160
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,639
over 25 acres I think there's like some

1161
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,559
natural breaks in scale that suggest a

1162
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:35,279
scaling up of equipment and what do you

1163
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,119
pick and how do you pick it and what's

1164
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,000
going to be most adaptable going forward

1165
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,519
so our training programs will focus on

1166
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,798
scaling up equipment and then the

1167
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,679
wholesale Market Readiness which we

1168
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:49,199
think diversifying markets is really

1169
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:52,239
important as we move into this uh as we

1170
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,199
see this growth in Local

1171
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:58,159
Foods the the last thing I just want to

1172
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,199
talk Al about and and um share with you

1173
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,318
is this whole area of work that we're

1174
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:06,598
doing right now focused on military

1175
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:09,519
veterans and uh it's really trying to um

1176
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,798
create Pathways for veterans to find

1177
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:15,519
employment on

1178
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:18,639
farms um or to um uh actually start

1179
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:21,400
Farms so um I wanted to draw your

1180
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:26,159
attention to it because I think that um

1181
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:28,318
all of you are really um

1182
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,639
uh out there and interfacing with a lot

1183
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,358
of folks and we are getting more

1184
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,480
veterans returning from service that we

1185
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:38,400
are trying to help them integrate back

1186
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,639
into community and whether it's

1187
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
agriculture or gardening or farming we

1188
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:46,118
know there's really meaningful benefits

1189
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:51,079
to them to be involved with this kind of

1190
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:53,599
physical work so I am going to just um

1191
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,039
uh I can share more with you but I don't

1192
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,960
I think I want to have enough time for

1193
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:01,759
conversation um but we have a whole new

1194
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,400
area of work that's developing around

1195
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,000
supporting veterans and in this August

1196
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,119
we're going to host a one-week intensive

1197
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,480
that's called armed to farm for um

1198
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:14,920
military veterans and it will take place

1199
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,599
in Central New York this year it was

1200
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,200

1201
