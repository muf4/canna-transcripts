i just want to take care of a few

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
housekeeping things before we begin

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
see the note

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,439
in the notes box about webinar number

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,759
six it was originally scheduled for 9 12

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,920
and because of a schedule conflict had

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,399
to be moved to

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
not 9 12 i'm sorry 12 9 had to be moved

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,799
to 12 16 and we apologize for any

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
inconvenience in the dates

21
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,759
i also want to point out to you that

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,359
there's a new file that you can download

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,759
in the files box the sphere fact sheet

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
this is a list of agronomy fact sheets

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
that the cornell nutrient management

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
program has put together

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
and they have implications across a

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,759
wider range of crops and so marvin pritz

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
our speaker from last week has selected

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,799
several of those titles

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
and he thinks that they will help

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,479
provide some background information for

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,879
you so feel free to download that list

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,640
of fact sheets and the urls to get to

35
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,000
them

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
one of the other housekeeping things

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
that i'd like to take care of is during

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
our first webinar we

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,118
inadvertently omitted a

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,960
pre-test question number 14

41
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,719
so what i'm going to do is open that now

42
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,519
and if you'll just select the answer

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,719
that

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:48,679
best fits your knowledge

45
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,679
we'll get that out of the way

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,280
okay the poll is open please register

i'll move it over here where you can see

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,360
it a little better there

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,719
we'll meet a couple more seconds people

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,840

52
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,840
chance to participate in the poll

53
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,560
okay i will open it again at the end

54
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,439
so that those who joined us later can

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,439

yeah thank you kathy and hi everyone i

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,519
am excited about this because we have

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
quite a bit of time to cover a topic in

109
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,359
a fair amount of detail so thanks kathy

110
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,478
and and marvin for putting on this uh

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,919
organizing this webinar uh series

112
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,159
so today we'll be talking about uh

113
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,639
means of correcting uh soil nutritional

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,080
problems for berries and today we'll

115
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,120
just

116
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,879
emphasize pre-plant considerations and

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
things you should be

118
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,159
concerned about

119
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
prior to planting

120
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,719
there

121
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,879
are a number of things beyond nutrition

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
that of course you'd be concerned about

123
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,319
uh prior to planting

124
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,120
uh any berry crop and um so if you look

125
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,240
at a a bear site there are things that

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,120
you ought to be uh thinking about that

127
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
may relate to nutrition or they they may

128
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,000
not relate to

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
to nutrition

130
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,159
some things that come to my mind

131
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,719
are first to have a good appreciation of

132
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,680
how texture varies across the site so

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,199
your site may contain one or more

134
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,038
soil types

135
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
you should have an idea

136
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,439
where those breaks in soil type occur

137
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,719
because that may influence how you

138
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,199
manage nutrition in coming years

139
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,199
you might consider the history of

140
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
management on the site was it had it

141
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
been used for

142
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
farming for a long time

143
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
do you think it would

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,759
benefit from some cover cropping or

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,038
manure or compost additions

146
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,560
that would

147
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,318
build up organic matter in the soil

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,478
are there wet spots

149
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,960
this does relate to nutrition to some

150
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,038
degree because it interacts with

151
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,038
fertility but if there are poorly

152
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,000
drained areas you might consider also

153
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,360
where

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,439
tile draining

155
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
drainage and

156
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,560
indoor surface

157
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,478
ditching may help to get rid of

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,959
excessive water

159
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,079
and then lastly of course have you done

160
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,038
the

161
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,719
adequate job of soil testing for ph and

162
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,719
nutrient levels prior to

163
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,839
prior to establishing your your plant

164
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,519
and i think that topic was covered in

165
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,918
the previous uh

166
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,839
webinar

167
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,680
so a lot of things to consider other

168
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,719
than uh nutrition

169
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,840
i think uh previously uh

170
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,560
webinars uh covered topics of uh

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,638
soil analyses and wanted to

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
reiterate i guess that there are a

173
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,519
number of private and university labs

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,280
that you could choose from to do soil

175
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,519
analyses and my

176
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
my opinion is you should pick one and

177
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,680
stick with it

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
that the uh

179
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,239
and then just use the interpretation

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,879
recommendations from that lab

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
because uh of course uh different labs

182
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
use different uh analytical

183
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,879
and extraction methods for for nutrients

184
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,439
and ph and lime requirements so make

185
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,199
make it simpler on yourself and

186
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,199
stick with one one lab

187
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,598
so the first consideration is uh prior

188
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,560
to

189
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,199
planting is of course ph and

190
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,160
we have two basic groups of berry crops

191
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,360
here and brambles and strawberries tend

192
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
to like

193
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,680
a slightly acidic

194
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
soil

195
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,080
blueberries and cranberries are very

196
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,759
acid loving so they

197
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
are way down on the

198
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,718
ph scale so the first

199
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,718
order of business is getting the ph in

200
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,720
the range where you would

201
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,720
like it for these uh these plants

202
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,040
so if the ph is too

203
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:55,759
too low uh liming is uh in order

204
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,879
and this is uh lime is essentially

205
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,799
calcium carbonate and that

206
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,799
dissolves slowly in

207
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:07,679
soil solutions and it releases calcium

208
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,799
and carbonate anions and

209
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,439
that's how

210
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,278
ph is reduced by limiting materials but

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,519
there are a lot of different uh liming

212
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,639
materials and a number of different

213
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,159
considerations for choosing the the best

214
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,278
type

215
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,958
the reasons for liming are

216
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,600
first to reduce a possibility of

217
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,479
toxic levels of aluminum or manganese so

218
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,879
as ph increases the solubility of those

219
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,959
two elements declines

220
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,240
so you

221
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,319
reduce the

222
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,519
availability of those to the plants and

223
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
the potential for toxicity

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,120
it

225
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,360
lyming supplies calcium and depending on

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,759
the source of magnesium

227
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,919
it increases the availability of

228
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,120
phosphorus if you're outside of the

229
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,879
range

230
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,839
required by the crops

231
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,480
and it has some kind of interesting

232
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,880
effects on microbial activity and some

233
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,920
of those are nitrogen

234
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,159
fixation so legumes tend to do better at

235
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,000
a higher ph range in terms of their

236
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,078
efficiency

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,839
nitrogen fixation

238
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,639
nitrification is the

239
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,079
um uh

240
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,199
oxidation of uh ammonium to produce

241
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,639
nitrate

242
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
uh the

243
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,958
microbes that are responsible for that

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,959
also we

245
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:35,039
prefer a higher ph so limiting tends to

246
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,518
speed up that process and of course

247
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,838
organic matter decomposition and and

248
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,879
nitrogen mineralization from organic

249
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,399
matter

250
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,838
uh tend to be

251
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,839
promoted by more neutral ph ranges

252
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,200
so how do you choose a lime

253
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,640
source well a number of different

254
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,640
considerations here first the

255
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,838
neutralizing value

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,559
so how

257
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,920
effective it is in

258
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,838
increasing ph of the reaction rate and

259
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,599
this is essentially

260
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,240
dictated by the size of lime particles

261
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,839
the need for magnesium

262
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,959
and then of course the cost of the

263
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
material

264
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,000
how easy it is to

265
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,879
apply and then the availability in your

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,879
your location

267
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,200
so let's start with um

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
the neutralizing value of lime materials

269
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
and these are all measured relative to

270
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,399
that of

271
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,640
pure calcium carbonate so that's how

272
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,120
how they're all compared

273
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,360
so that's given a neutralizing value of

274
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,639
a hundred the

275
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
dolomitic

276
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,600
lime

277
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,720
can be a little lower or a little higher

278
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,519
than pure calcium carbonate

279
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,519
calcitic lime or high cow lime

280
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,879
tends to be

281
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,039
a little bit

282
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,480
lower than pure calcium carbonate

283
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,480
because it has some impurities

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,879
um hydrated lime is much higher in

285
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,240
activity

286
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:21,159
marl

287
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,159
excuse me a minute i need to cough here

288
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,479
sorry about that

289
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,360
getting over a cold

290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
um marl is

291
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,159
kind of a

292
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,239
lime uh mud uh and it's mined in

293
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,799
different locations and that

294
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,200
varies a whole lot in liming

295
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,519
neutralizing value so that can be

296
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,519
pretty close to limestone

297
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,078
or much much lower

298
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,360
and then i i listed gypsum

299
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,799
at the bottom just to indicate that

300
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,639
that is not a

301
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:12,479
liming material so people think about

302
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,000
calcium as being a liming material

303
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,039
and it's not the calcium it's the

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,078
carbonate so calcium sulfate or

305
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,039
gypsum

306
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,039
has no effect on on ph

307
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,519
and then the other consideration then is

308
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
the

309
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,919
speed of reaction and this is pretty

310
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,278
much dictated by the

311
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,838
particle size uh and how that influences

312
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,519
the surface

313
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,160
area of lime

314
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,159
materials

315
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,720
so

316
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,799
this chart indicates a

317
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,680
breakdown of the

318
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,759
particles by size so the

319
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,399
smaller mesh size

320
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,439
are the larger particles so mesh size is

321
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,839
holes per

322
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,760
per

323
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,760
inch and then the

324
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,958
vertical

325
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,120
axis is the percentage of the material

326
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,359
reacting in three years

327
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,240
so you can see a

328
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,680
material that's uh larger than this size

329
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,399
of 20 for the most part reacts fairly

330
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:39,198
well within a year or two of

331
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,039
application to soils

332
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:45,039
stuff between mesh size 8 and 20

333
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,519
reacts very slowly so

334
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,799
less than half of it's uh reacted within

335
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
three years

336
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,719
and then material that's very big zero

337
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,000
to eight mesh size is almost inert in

338
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
soil so

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,759
when you think about the value of a lime

340
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:04,239
material if it contains a lot of uh

341
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,278
eight to twenty uh mesh size uh

342
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,278
particles uh that stuff's pretty uh

343
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,958
pretty much worthless from

344
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,000
a quick acting uh standpoint in soils

345
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,638
so the

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,198
smaller the mess size the

347
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,639
or the smaller the particles the quicker

348
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,639
these things are going to react in the

349
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,639
soil

350
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,639
another type of

351
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,600
lime that's used in

352
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,720
fruit production in various areas

353
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,079
is pelletized or sometimes called pell

354
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,680
lime

355
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,198
and this material is actually a very

356
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,120
fine

357
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,679
mesh material

358
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,000
up to 100 mesh

359
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,559
of and it can be either

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,839
calcitic a high cal lime or a dilemmatic

361
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,198
lime

362
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,519
and it's uh

363
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,559
formulated into small

364
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,959
pellets using binders so the pellets are

365
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,000
fairly big but it's important to realize

366
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,919
that the

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,159
the actual limestone in it is very fine

368
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,958
so pell lime generally

369
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:22,719
reacts about as quickly and neutralizes

370
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,719
the very same amount of acidity as

371
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,560
egg lime with the same neutralizing

372
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
value and there's some question about

373
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,000
you can imagine that you're putting this

374
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,278
a large pellet

375
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
of

376
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,958
almost powdered uh limestone in in the

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,679
soil

378
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,159
and it does create kind of a

379
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,278
a high ph zone

380
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,799
around that immediate area of the pellet

381
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,198
and the

382
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,799
as a result the remainder of the pellet

383
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,799
may um

384
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,719
that may inhibit the

385
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,758
solubility of the remainder of the

386
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,519
pellet so there's some question about

387
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,519
whether the fact that it comes in a

388
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,720
pellet or not uh affects how quickly it

389
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,359
reacts

390
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,798
and i don't have a good answer

391
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,759
for you on that but generally i would

392
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,279
think a

393
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,919
pel lime is acting about the same as

394
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,918
as far as the neutralizing value of a

395
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,799
regular egg lime

396
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,038
the reason to consider this is it is uh

397
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,240
because it's pelletized you can spread

398
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,440
it through

399
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
any fertilizer spreader and it's easy to

400
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
handle

401
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,000
you know that a lot of

402
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,400
lime materials uh are dusty

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
and you can actually lose some during

404
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
application to to the wind and that

405
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
wouldn't be the case with a pelleted

406
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,079
material

407
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,200
of course you you need to pay for all

408
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:54,720
that convenience so these uh pelleted

409
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,919
materials are much more expensive

410
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,919
than regular egg lime

411
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,679
couldn't get this to

412
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,759
speed along here

413
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,360
now it speeds along too quickly so

414
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,798
occasionally we're interested in

415
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:52,079
lowering soil ph

416
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,720
for raspberries and strawberries this is

417
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,678
uncommon but it's certainly a

418
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,319
common desire in uh for blueberry sites

419
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,759
and the uh the reason for that is that

420
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,519
ph can be

421
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,038
higher than a desired uh range for uh

422
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,440
blueberries

423
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:12,319
and under michigan conditions if we we

424
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,558
get a ph above 5.5 or so

425
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,798
we start seeing this iron chlorosis that

426
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,798
you see in the in the pictures here so

427
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,519
we want to avoid that by

428
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:25,000
planting blueberries in a soil with a

429
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,000
proper ph

430
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,080
and there are a number of

431
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:35,199
materials that will reduce soil uh ph

432
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,558
but sulfur is the best one to use

433
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,279
sulfur is elemental sulfur

434
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,079
and

435
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,918
depending on the brand if this can come

436
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,519
as prills

437
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,960
it can come as chips or even powdered

438
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:54,319
and these materials range from 90 to 95

439
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,279
sulfur so if uh recommendation is

440
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:01,279
for uh 500 pounds per acre you'd want to

441
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,279
increase that by 5 to 10 percent

442
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
on account of the

443
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,600
lower

444
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,798
than 100 percent content of sulfur

445
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:13,439
the prills are uh of course easiest to

446
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,839
use they're they're low in dust

447
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,519
they're easy to spread with a

448
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,839
fertilizer spreader

449
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,079
chipped

450
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,839
sulfur is kind of intermediate it tends

451
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:28,558
to come with a lot of different chip

452
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,558
sizes and it's also with quite a bit of

453
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,240
dust in uh in the material and of course

454
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,399
powdered is difficult to

455
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,519
to use all together although i sometimes

456
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,840
recommend powdered sulfur to acidify the

457
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,639
soil around a couple of blueberry bushes

458
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,639
in somebody's background backyard

459
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,159
because they can buy a small quantity of

460
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,120
it

461
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
iron

462
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,279
sulfate is a salt

463
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:02,079
this also reduces soil ph

464
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,720
it reacts quickly in soils but it's very

465
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,000
expensive because it's about 1 6 as

466
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
potent

467
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,079
as sulfur

468
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,439
for reducing soil ph so you have to use

469
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,839
a lot of it

470
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,320
and as a result there may be a potential

471
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,480
for salt stress if you're using a lot of

472
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:22,000
this material immediately before

473
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,240
applying or before planting blueberries

474
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,240
the

475
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
aluminum sulfate

476
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,558
is pretty much the same as iron sulfate

477
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,679
it acts quite quickly

478
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,079
and but requires high rates and because

479
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,759
it contains aluminum there's a potential

480
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,798
for

481
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,640
accumulating toxic levels of aluminum so

482
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,319
that's not generally recommended either

483
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,520
so sulfur is the best

484
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,599
choice

485
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,839
sometimes people

486
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,639
think about using

487
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,959
acidifying nitrogen fertilizers

488
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,960
to reduce soil ph and i wanted to talk

489
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,200
about that a little bit so

490
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,798
ammonium sulfate is a very acidic

491
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,919
nitrogen fertilizer

492
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,440
it helps to maintain soil ph low but it

493
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
shouldn't be used

494
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,519
to

495
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,440
reduce soil ph initially and the reason

496
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,480
is that it if you're applying enough of

497
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,798
that to reduce ph you'll

498
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,839
apply a huge amount of nitrogen that's

499
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,038
not needed and maybe

500
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,000
damaging so

501
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,558
for example one pound of sulfur

502
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,599
provides about the same acidity

503
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,359
as two and a 2.8 pounds of ammonium

504
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,079
sulfate

505
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,158
so if you had a recommendation for 500

506
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,678
pounds of sulfur

507
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
this would be equivalent to an

508
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,080
application of

509
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,240
1400 pounds of

510
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,960
ammonium sulfate

511
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,480
and that would deliver almost 300 pounds

512
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,798
of nitrogen so

513
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,960
it's not something you'd want to put on

514
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,359
prior to planting a

515
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,440
blueberries for example

516
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,519
it certainly wouldn't be efficient and

517
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,519
probably wouldn't be very cost effective

518
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,519
either

519
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,279
there was a question from jeff about how

520
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,439
important is sulfur to this group of

521
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,279
plants and

522
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,759
generally i i haven't

523
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,000
seen or heard of any

524
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,720
instances where sulfur

525
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,400
is actually deficient in these

526
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,798
this group of plants

527
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,759
so sulfur of course is a essential

528
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,200
element but most soils contain adequate

529
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,440
levels for

530
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
uh for these crops so it's not to say

531
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
that it can't happen but it's i'd say

532
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,240
it's un

533
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,240
uncommon

534
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,679
and then a comment from uh charlie uh

535
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,038
it's very important for blueberries and

536
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,880
cranberries and

537
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,720
you know that that is true uh but again

538
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,240
if ph

539
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,558
is

540
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,079
acidic enough for those

541
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,359
those crops

542
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,798
then there's

543
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:17,678
automatically abundant levels of

544
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:21,440
sulfate in the soil

545
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,320
um i don't think of um

546
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,120
any instances where you have to apply

547
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,519
sulfur uh strictly as a fertilizer i

548
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,798
think most of those uh soils contain

549
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,839
adequate uh

550
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,839
sulfur levels

551
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,000
and

552
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,439
jeff has another question with less

553
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,038
sulfur and

554
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,679
rain water could we start seeing

555
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:05,759
sulfur deficiency on on coarse soils you

556
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:10,480
know i think certainly possible but um

557
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,480
no instances of that that i'm aware of

558
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,240
i think it's related to that is uh you

559
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,320
know the

560
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,480
switch away from sulfur as a

561
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,879
fungicide so there are a number of those

562
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,919
materials that have been applied

563
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,278
routinely for different uh reasons and

564
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,200
perhaps

565
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,200
the needs will change over over time

566
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,720
uh in a little bit about

567
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,079
sulfur

568
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
so

569
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,359
this material

570
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,840
is oxidized by a specific group of

571
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,639
bacteria in the soil so

572
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,720
it is a biological process

573
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
and it works very well when the soils

574
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,360
are moist

575
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:14,639
and warm and well aerated

576
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:17,278
so the bacteria oxidize that sulfur to

577
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,520
produce sulfuric acid

578
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,640
uh but it's a

579
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,000
biological process so it keep in mind

580
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,759
that

581
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,839
nothing much happens during the off

582
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,839
season when the soils are too cold for

583
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,759
those bacteria to work

584
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,519
and we normally think a sulfur is

585
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,679
requiring the better part of a whole

586
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,798
growing season to

587
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,960
fully react in the soil

588
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,400
it may take a little longer than that or

589
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,960
it may take a little less than that

590
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,000
depending on how much is applied and

591
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,679
perhaps a microbial community in in the

592
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,038
soil

593
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,038
the

594
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,000
important thing is to try to incorporate

595
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,319
it for a good um

596
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,278
distribution in the root zone for for a

597
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,879
quick

598
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,640
reaction

599
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,720
so if you were

600
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,240
establishing a site for

601
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,640
blueberries for example and you

602
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,640
needed to apply sulfur to reduce ph

603
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,039
you have a choice of broadcasting that

604
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,960
material or perhaps banding it

605
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,879
along the rows where the blueberry

606
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,360
bushes will go

607
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,240
and in most cases i think it's best to

608
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,798
broadcast over the whole site

609
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,839
i know in some cases where particularly

610
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,558
on a heavier soil that's

611
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:37,678
uh highly buffered that it may be best

612
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,398
to

613
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,798
or most economical to bandit where the

614
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,558
bushes will go because you only need to

615
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,960
apply

616
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,839
perhaps half as much as you would

617
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
broadcast it

618
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,159
and kathy i can't seem to advance things

619
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,159
real well i don't know if it's my

620
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,159
computer

621
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,240
um

622
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,119
sulfur requirements so

623
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,919
this is the amount of sulfur required to

624
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:21,839
reduce ph to

625
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,960
a level of uh four um starting with uh

626
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,319
initial ph of five or five five six or

627
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,558
six five

628
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,839
and the important point i wanted to make

629
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,839
here is is how

630
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,278
instrumental the soil type is to the

631
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,319
amount of sulfur that's required to drop

632
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:43,919
ph so you can see that um

633
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:47,119
from for a given drop in ph it will we

634
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,880
take two or three times as much

635
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,000
uh to drop ph on a loam soil opposed to

636
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,159
a sand

637
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,880
and then four or five times as much to

638
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:02,159
drop it on a clay opposed to a sand

639
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,200
so that's why people say that it it may

640
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,320
not be economical to produce blueberries

641
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,960
on a

642
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:13,599
a soil with a very high initial ph

643
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,038
if that soil is also highly buffered a

644
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,278
heavier soil

645
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,278
so you take a a great deal of sulfur

646
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,158
generally as a caution we'd say if

647
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,278
you're applying more than 500 pounds of

648
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,679
sulfur you'd probably should consider

649
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,000
splitting that application into

650
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,278
into two

651
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,359
i wanted to mention also that

652
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,839
sulfur can produce

653
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,479
hydrogen sulfide in soils that are

654
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:45,278
poorly drained so if if there are

655
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,360
water logged areas in the field

656
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,440
hydrogen sulfide can be produced and

657
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,398
that's toxic to

658
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,278
to plant roots so that can cause damage

659
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:54,879
so

660
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,679
in a

661
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,559
situation like this you can imagine that

662
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,840
if a grower put his sulfur down

663
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,119
prior to planting these young

664
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,199
blueberries

665
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,839
and he has these

666
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,840
flooded or poorly drained areas

667
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,199
that you could have

668
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,759
toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide develop

669
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,519
in in those areas but it's primarily

670
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,919
because of the

671
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,918
anaerobic conditions in the in the root

672
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,919
zone

673
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,200
let's see

674
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,959
pre-plant phosphorus use so the

675
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,399
recommendation here would be to

676
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,960
incorporate prior to planting at rates

677
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,239
indicated by soil test results

678
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,360
so you can choose materials based on the

679
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,319
cost per unit of

680
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,398
p205

681
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,480
and the availability of phosphorus from

682
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:53,119
those materials so the the standard

683
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
materials

684
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,559
super phosphate and concentrated super

685
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:02,319
phosphate are

686
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:05,440
nearly all available meaning they're all

687
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,759
almost 100 percent soluble

688
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,038
so the choice between those of course

689
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:13,200
would be

690
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:16,079
based on the cost per unit of p205

691
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,720
i want i mentioned rock phosphate here

692
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,480
because this is the mineral that

693
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,640
these other phosphate

694
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,798
fertilizers are manufactured from

695
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,559
and it's fairly high in phosphorus but

696
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:32,960
very low and soluble phosphorus

697
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,519
i think it may have some utility in

698
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,480
organic settings but also

699
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,440
um

700
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,720
in uh in blueberry settings where you

701
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,919
want a slow release of phosphorus over

702
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,919
time so

703
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,640
in high ph soils rock phosphate would be

704
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,360
non-effective because the solubility

705
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,559
goes down with as ph goes up but in

706
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,759
acidic soils this might be a nice

707
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:02,798
material to supply a gradual

708
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:06,319
release of phosphorus over time as long

709
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,319
as the ph is low

710
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:19,919
uh jeff is asking uh split uh sulfur

711
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,840
applications um that you plow down half

712
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,759
and disc in half

713
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,240
that would be uh fine

714
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:29,278
typically i think more about

715
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,359
perhaps uh applying uh half in one

716
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,480
season and then half in the spring prior

717
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,759
to uh

718
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
planting

719
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,558
so that you have

720
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,519
part of that reacting in the soil at

721
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,519
different time intervals

722
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,359
and uh

723
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,678
problems with applying monoammonium or

724
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,558
diamonium phosphate and

725
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,919
so pre-plant those materials don't make

726
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,879
much sense

727
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,399
as phosphorus sources because you really

728
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,919
don't want to be

729
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,239
putting a whole lot of nitrogen in to

730
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,320
the ground

731
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,319
prior to planting

732
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,319
typically

733
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,798
and i would uh

734
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,799
say that

735
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,159
they're very very expensive sources of

736
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,278
phosphorus so if if you need uh the

737
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,240
nitrogen uh in those materials then it

738
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,240
it

739
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,480
is an economic source of the two

740
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,359
nutrients but all you're looking for is

741
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,000
phosphorus then it's an expensive source

742
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,000
of phosphorus

743
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,839
eric are you still having problems

744
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,600
advancing

745
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:56,398
yeah hasn't happened before so i was

746
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,398
wondering if it

747
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,839
had something to do with the

748
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,519
website

749
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,398
i can advance from here if you just tell

750
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,559
me when

751
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:11,039
oh okay thank you and then uh pre-plant

752
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,039
uh uh potassium so

753
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,838
again you'd be incorporating this prior

754
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,599
to planting at rates based on the soil

755
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,559
test results

756
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,599
so the materials of choice would be

757
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,719
dependent on the cost again per unit of

758
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,800
nutrients so per unit of k2o

759
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,000
the need for other nutrients and the

760
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,240
potential

761
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,039
hazard

762
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,838
from

763
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,838
chloride

764
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,079
so

765
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,720
the

766
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,320
typical materials are potassium chloride

767
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,078
or murietta potash and potassium

768
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,440
sulfate

769
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,320
and

770
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,398
these

771
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,838
fairly high in

772
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,440
a k2o

773
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,159
percentage

774
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,440
potassium chloride is the least

775
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:10,078
expensive of these uh based uh uh

776
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,920
per unit of uh k2o bases

777
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,160
potassium sulfate's a little bit more

778
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,960
expensive and

779
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,598
potassium magnesium sulfate

780
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,480
would be a quite high

781
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,920
cost source of

782
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
potassium

783
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,079
so the other

784
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,559
consideration then is what other

785
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,599
nutrients would you need so if soil

786
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,960
tests indicate that magnesium is low

787
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,240
then this

788
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,159
potassium magnesium sulfate or sopo mag

789
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,959
may be a good

790
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:46,960
good choice economically

791
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,039
and then the potential hazard of

792
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,400
from chlorine i wanted to mention a

793
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,079
little bit so

794
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,920
you know you usually have a choice

795
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,839
between

796
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,599
sop or the

797
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:02,719
sulfate and

798
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,359
the muriat or the potassium chloride and

799
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,759
the muriat is nearly always quite a bit

800
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:07,759
cheaper

801
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,599
of course it contains chloride so there

802
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:17,279
is a potential for causing uh damage to

803
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,760
plants because of that so my

804
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,839
my feeling on uh use of

805
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
this is that if you're using uh

806
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,920
relatively low levels

807
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,199
100 100

808
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,200
pound rates

809
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,199
maybe up to 200 pound rates of

810
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,240
potassium

811
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,358
that

812
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,679
chloride is is probably safe on most of

813
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:41,838
these crops

814
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,440
i think if you

815
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:48,239
are on a sandy

816
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,880
soil and are concerned about this that

817
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,439
and you still want to go with a cheaper

818
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,240
chloride source that

819
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,960
application in the fall would be a great

820
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,358
idea so if you apply

821
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,358
chloride in the fall most of that

822
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,119
anion is going to leach out of the root

823
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,199
zone by the

824
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,358
end of the winter so that reduces the

825
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,559
potential risk

826
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,159
so again if if you're using a

827
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,880
lower rates of

828
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,960
potash i think in most cases the

829
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,838
myriad is

830
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,679
is safe and if you have some concern

831
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,759
about the safety

832
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,679
then you might consider applying that in

833
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,839
the fall so that you give time for the

834
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:33,159
chloride to leach out of the uh out of

835
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,159
the root zone

836
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:47,439
did you advance that kathy thank you

837
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,920
uh pre-plant magnesium and calcium so um

838
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,400
again incorporate prior to planting uh

839
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
based on soil test results and here the

840
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,039
the choice of materials would be based

841
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,519
on the

842
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,079
cost per unit of nutrient again

843
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,639
the need for a ph adjustment and then

844
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,280
the need for other nutrients

845
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,920
so the cheapest source of calcium and

846
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,119
magnesium would be the limestones

847
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,400
calcitic lime is normally greater than

848
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,838
30 percent

849
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,639
calcium

850
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,159
and quite low in magnesium

851
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:24,799
dolomitic lime is uh lower in

852
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,159
calcium and higher in magnesium but the

853
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,880
actual ratios vary depending on

854
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,879
on the source

855
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,400
so those would be the good

856
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:40,079
choices if you're trying to increase ph

857
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,920
if you need magnesium but you don't want

858
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,280
to increase ph

859
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,880
then magnesium sulfate

860
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,640
would be a good

861
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,160
choice

862
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,118
if you needed

863
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,559
calcium but you did not want to

864
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,960
increase

865
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,239
a ph and calcium sulfate would be a good

866
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,639
choice

867
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,879
and of course potassium magnesium

868
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,879
sulfate supplement is uh

869
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,880
provides both of those

870
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,880
nutrients

871
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,358
i wanted to talk a little bit about uh

872
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:31,440
interesting case of gypsum and this this

873
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:34,239
came out of work that marvin pritz uh um

874
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,679
did a number of years ago in in uh

875
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,919
new york

876
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,319
and the whole story

877
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,280
my thinking is not in on this but it's

878
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,119
an interesting situation in that uh

879
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,920
gypsum um

880
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,960
it supplies calcium but doesn't

881
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,280
alter ph is is known to be uh real

882
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,639
beneficial in soils that are

883
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,519
uh either saline uh that me meaning high

884
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,639
in salts or sodic meaning high in in

885
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,679
sodium

886
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,920
so

887
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,480
in those cases

888
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,838
gypsum tends to improve the

889
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,240
adhesion of clay my seals to one another

890
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:15,039
to flaculation and that improves water

891
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:17,199
infiltration and drainage in those

892
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,759
soils

893
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,960
in reality though that we don't normally

894
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,160
run into high salt or certainly high

895
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,559
sodium soils in the eastern u.s because

896
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,118
it's a

897
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,719
humid environment with

898
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,519
plenty of precipitation most of the time

899
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:40,799
but the other interesting thing about

900
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:42,079
this that came out of marvin's work is

901
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,200
gypsum

902
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,760
reduced

903
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,318
raspberry root rot which is caused by

904
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,280
phytothera species

905
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,759
in new york and a little bit later there

906
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,240
was some additional work in

907
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,200
washington state that

908
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:01,039
also

909
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:03,439
showed a benefit of gypsum applications

910
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:07,119
where um

911
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:11,358
phytophthora was a problem

912
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,200
so this uh these observations aren't

913
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,799
entirely confined to

914
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:18,000
raspberries so

915
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,839
gypsum has reduced phytathera diseases

916
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,079
of

917
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:25,599
avocado and soybean and i didn't put a

918
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,519
reference in there but also on

919
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,519
ginseng

920
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,960
so these are different

921
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,519
fungal species and the

922
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,599
gypsum seems to benefit the plants in

923
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,440
each uh each regard

924
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,920
and the interesting thing about it is

925
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,800
that the affected gypsum doesn't seem to

926
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,200
be on

927
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,400
soil uh water drainage or physical

928
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,559
characteristics

929
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,200
it seems to be a fairly specific effect

930
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,880
of high calcium concentrations

931
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,519
that inhibit the

932
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,160
reproductive growth of the fungi

933
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,800
and also inhibit the growth of the fungi

934
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,679
within the plant tissues

935
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,160
so

936
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,118
marvin's recommendation and i'd agree

937
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:11,679
with this is that

938
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,318
to incorporate three to six tons of

939
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,919
gypsum prior to planting raspberries on

940
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,119
sites where there was a history of

941
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,119
phytophthora root rot

942
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,639
the

943
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,960
i guess

944
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,960
additional question would be how about

945
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,280
sites without a

946
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,599
history if i talk through a root rot

947
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,480
and then also

948
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,559
what about a red steel

949
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,119
of strawberries which is also a

950
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,400
phytophthora problem and i couldn't find

951
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,480
any

952
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
literature on that but certainly there's

953
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,719
a potential for

954
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,760
affecting

955
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,719
any

956
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,839
phytophthora species by

957
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:57,078
enhancing free calcium concentrations in

958
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,078
in soils

959
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,440
would you advance that kathy

960
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,719
so the other

961
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,039
question related to that would be

962
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,439
would you get that response irregardless

963
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:15,599
of how much calcium is naturally in the

964
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,400
soil so in in michigan we think about

965
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,400
a balance of potassium magnesium and

966
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,200
calcium in soils and

967
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,680
that's expressed as a

968
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,078
percentage of the total bases that are

969
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,159
on the exchange complex and i i think

970
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,280
you've went through this in a previous

971
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,318
uh

972
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,040
webinar to to some degree but

973
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,000
it

974
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,279
uh i guess the question this raises is

975
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,719
if if you're working in a soil that's uh

976
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,760
already

977
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,159
abundantly uh supplied with calcium is

978
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
more calcium in the form of gypsum going

979
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,279
to

980
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,000
provide some benefit as far as

981
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,400
phytothera control and i don't don't

982
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,199
think that's known at this point but

983
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:04,559
certainly an interesting

984
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:06,719
effect of a specific ion calcium on

985
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,759
fungal growth and

986
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,759
disease suppression

987
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,680
could you advance that again kathy

988
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,400
thanks

989
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:19,440
salt stress so i wanted to go into this

990
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,200
in a little bit more detail when we

991
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,240
talk about

992
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,639
nutrient additions to established uh

993
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,639
plants

994
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,160
but a little bit of background here so

995
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,400
high soil salt levels tend to be

996
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,799
problems in arid regions

997
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,920
so they're much less of an issue for us

998
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,039
in the eastern u.s because uh

999
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,760
precipitation tends to leech uh soil

1000
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:51,119
salts out of the topsoil horizons

1001
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,200
but of course growers can

1002
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,280
create these problems they can create

1003
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,838
them by applying

1004
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,560
excessive fertilizers

1005
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,000
or inappropriate types of fertilizers at

1006
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,880
the wrong time

1007
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,400
or by using a high salt irrigation water

1008
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,000
source

1009
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,318
so the importance of this is that

1010
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,159
these berry crops we're concerned about

1011
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:19,119
are among the least tolerant of

1012
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,559
elevated salt levels

1013
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,720
so it's certainly something to be

1014
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,078
concerned about and these are just some

1015
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:28,318
rankings of different fruit crops

1016
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,359
and their tolerance to

1017
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,519
soil

1018
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,880
electrical conductivity which is the way

1019
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,880
that soil salt levels are are measured

1020
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,720
and you can see that they're a number of

1021
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,838
the tree fruit crops are quite a bit

1022
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,078
more

1023
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,159
tolerant than our

1024
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,560
blackberries or

1025
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,440
raspberries or strawberries

1026
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,559
um

1027
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,880
blueberries weren't listed here but um

1028
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,559
my thought is that they they would be

1029
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,640
right down there with raspberries or

1030
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,559
strawberries and perhaps even a little

1031
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,480
bit more sensitive to total salts

1032
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,199
so it's certainly something we should be

1033
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,000
concerned about

1034
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,519
and

1035
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,199
the effect of

1036
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:10,400
fertilizers

1037
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,118
on

1038
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,760
salt content of the soil

1039
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,960
has been pretty well documented so

1040
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,240
it's expressed as a salt index

1041
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,880
and

1042
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:25,039
here are some of the standard

1043
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,358
nitrogen sources

1044
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:30,239
fertilizer sources

1045
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,519
and then also the assault index for

1046
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,279
those

1047
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,318
and we'll talk a little bit more about

1048
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,960
this in

1049
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:39,279
the webinar after the holidays but

1050
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,280
the point i wanted to make is we quite

1051
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,079
often there are published

1052
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,240
values for salt indices

1053
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,400
for different types of

1054
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,919
fertilizers but these are

1055
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,880
essentially per

1056
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,639
unit of fertilizer not per unit of

1057
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,760
nutrient

1058
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,960
so

1059
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,200
although ammonium nitrate has a salt

1060
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,960
index 105

1061
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:07,439
very high

1062
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,639
it contains a higher concentration of

1063
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,400
nitrogen

1064
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:16,159
than some other nutrient sources

1065
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,358
so if you extrapolate that salt index on

1066
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:22,719
a per unit of fertilizer basis

1067
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:25,598
per pound of nitrogen

1068
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,919
what you find is that the

1069
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,960
potential for salt injury

1070
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,680
might be less using that than it would

1071
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,960
be if you're using calcium nitrate

1072
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:38,639
and the assumption being that if if you

1073
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,199
desired to apply

1074
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,480
a certain amount of nitrogen

1075
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,879
that you would contribute less salt

1076
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,719
for that amount of nitrogen

1077
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,079
using the ammonium nitrate than you

1078
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,598
would with

1079
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,920
calcium nitrate

1080
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,599
even though they often are calcium

1081
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,559
nitrate is often

1082
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,359
touted as being a more safe

1083
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:06,119
fertilizer from a salt standpoint

1084
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,119
so i hope that's uh that's clear

1085
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,559
would you advance me oh there we go

1086
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,680
and there are salt indices for um

1087
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,240
phosphorus and potassium fertilizers too

1088
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,480
and those are here and

1089
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:25,279
for the most part uh phosphorus

1090
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,559
fertilizers are relatively low in salt

1091
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,240
indices except for the ammoniated

1092
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,760
phosphates

1093
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:37,118
potassium sources chloride is is more

1094
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,480
has a higher

1095
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,480
risk of salt injury

1096
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,880
could you advance that again kathy

1097
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,279
and

1098
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,760
so a little bit about organic nitrogen

1099
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,400
sources a lot of different uh

1100
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,599
materials uh here

1101
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,599
and i wanted to

1102
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,640
point out just

1103
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,240
some of the higher nitrogen

1104
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:09,039
content content organic sources would be

1105
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,239
dried blood and fish meal and nitrate a

1106
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,239
soda

1107
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,759
make sure you you check

1108
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,199
with

1109
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,160
certifiers

1110
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:21,159
to see which types of these are

1111
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,159
allowable

1112
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,199
uh phosphorus uh bone meal uh fish meal

1113
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,839
or are good sources and then uh kelp and

1114
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,399
and wood ash would be good sources of

1115
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:42,400
potash

1116
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,358
a little bit about pre-plant manure and

1117
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,000
compost

1118
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:50,000
additions

1119
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,000
and when those would be uh

1120
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,039
beneficial

1121
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,239
and i think this has a lot of

1122
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:02,480
significance uh now with uh

1123
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,719
increasing prices of uh

1124
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,599
conventional fertilizers so

1125
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,759
you know

1126
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,838
these are

1127
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,920
national um

1128
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:14,719
prices per pound of nitrogen they're

1129
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,039
probably different for uh with

1130
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,399
dealers in your area but on a national

1131
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,880
average

1132
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,720
prices for these nitrogen fertilizers

1133
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,240
has doubled in the last

1134
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,159
decade

1135
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,318
i would guess that they're not going to

1136
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,598
go down from that

1137
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:35,119
uh and these are um similar uh prices

1138
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,960
nationally for a couple of sources of

1139
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,200
phosphate

1140
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,838
they've more than doubled in the last

1141
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,838
decade and

1142
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,959
and then prices for potassium chloride

1143
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,920
which is all also more than

1144
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,519
more than doubled so it it

1145
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,358
is

1146
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,719
useful to think about this because it

1147
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,519
kind of changes

1148
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,919
the

1149
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,719
pricing structure of

1150
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,760
these materials relatives to

1151
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:06,239
what you get in compost and and manure

1152
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,240
sources

1153
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,480
so whether it's a

1154
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,200
manure or a compost

1155
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,519
if you calculate um

1156
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,799
cost per unit of

1157
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,599
nutrient

1158
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,480
somebody's getting very close to a cost

1159
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,480
of

1160
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,480
conventional nutrient sources

1161
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,799
so of course

1162
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,039
organic matter has a number of benefits

1163
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,359
and it's going to be most

1164
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,519
beneficial on sandy soils or those that

1165
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:40,880
had been heavily farmed for for a number

1166
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,199
of years where

1167
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,920
organic additions were not put back into

1168
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:45,519
the

1169
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,200
soil

1170
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,838
all of these materials should be

1171
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,439
analyzed first

1172
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,119
before applying them

1173
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,079
so that you avoid problems with

1174
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,838
excessive total salts excessive

1175
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,400
phosphorous

1176
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,639
nitrogen tie up or excessive

1177
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,119
availability of nitrogen

1178
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,838
and then some

1179
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,400
elemental toxicities

1180
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,639
you can apply and incorporate raw manure

1181
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,960
that's probably best in the fall before

1182
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:19,039
spring planting

1183
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,519
avoid using any manure or compost which

1184
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:25,039
has relatively high salt levels so again

1185
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,039
that's measured as

1186
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:32,960
electrical conductivity and

1187
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:35,599
generally if level is above 10 decisions

1188
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,599
per meter

1189
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,000
that indicates a potential problem

1190
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:44,879
you could apply materials with moderate

1191
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,960
salt levels in the fall so again if

1192
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,200
they're applied in the fall

1193
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,880
much of the salt

1194
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,358
exposure would be leached out of the

1195
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,640
root zone by the spring when you're

1196
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,679
planting

1197
00:52:54,639 --> 00:53:01,118
so you'd reduce the potential

1198
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:04,480
and of course manure types

1199
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,680
vary enormously in nutrient

1200
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,559
content

1201
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,838
and these values are given in pounds per

1202
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,839
ton of

1203
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:12,838
manure

1204
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:19,358
um

1205
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,680
issue that limits manure use in most

1206
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,119
states is the phosphorus content

1207
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,879
so in michigan our manure games are

1208
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,920
generally accepted

1209
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,440
ag management practices

1210
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,800
indicate that

1211
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,800
first you should know soil and manure p

1212
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,519
levels and then

1213
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,160
if

1214
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:46,159
soil tests indicate that there's a p

1215
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:49,199
that p is needed

1216
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:53,519
then apply enough manure to supply 100

1217
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:55,679
to 200 pounds of p205 to the acre so of

1218
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,639
course you need to know the content of

1219
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,799
the material to know how much to apply

1220
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:04,558
and then if the uh

1221
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:08,000
in this case it's a braid p1 extraction

1222
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:11,599
uh soil test indicates levels for 75 to

1223
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,119
150 parts per million then under our

1224
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,200
setting we'd

1225
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,640
say that you can only apply enough

1226
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:21,279
manure to replace crop removal which is

1227
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:23,118
pretty minimal with these berry crops

1228
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,240
and then of course if soil tests is

1229
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,760
above 150 then do not apply

1230
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,959
any manure

1231
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,280
so

1232
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,318
whether or not you can apply manure

1233
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,880
is

1234
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:37,599
dictated by the phosphorus content of

1235
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,519
that manure but also the salt content

1236
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,720
and the potential for doing harm to the

1237
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,519
uh

1238
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,519
to the berries

1239
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:49,919
and i found these data which were

1240
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,920
the range in

1241
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,640
parameters of 20

1242
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,240
compost samples from massachusetts farm

1243
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:02,639
farms and it was back in

1244
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:05,598
1996 but the things i wanted you to look

1245
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,358
at here were first the range in soluble

1246
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,559
salt content so

1247
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,279
we felt

1248
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:14,079
above 10 is problematic and there was

1249
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,798
some that was almost twice that

1250
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,440
and then secondly the carbon to nitrogen

1251
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:22,318
ratio so that varied a great deal and

1252
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,760
that has consequences horticulturally

1253
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,239
too

1254
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,520
john bierenbaum at michigan state

1255
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,598
university has done a similar survey of

1256
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,039
commercial

1257
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,760
compost

1258
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,838
products from from michigan and the top

1259
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,839
graph here is uh

1260
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,279
carbon to nitrogen ratios and you can

1261
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,599
see that they vary

1262
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,000
a great deal from

1263
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:50,880
under 10

1264
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,159
10 to 1 to up to over 25 to 1.

1265
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,440
the

1266
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,519
saturated

1267
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,240
media

1268
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,920
extract is the electrical conductivity

1269
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,598
or the salt content

1270
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,639
and again you can see that some of these

1271
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,680
are very uh very low and and safe there

1272
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:09,679
are a couple of them that were

1273
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,159
somewhat high and and one that was uh

1274
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,879
disturbingly high so it's uh the

1275
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:17,598
take-home message is uh be sure you know

1276
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,559
the characteristics of these materials

1277
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,559
before you use them

1278
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,480
and the the

1279
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,358
significance of a carbon to nitrogen

1280
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:31,199
ratio is

1281
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:33,598
primarily on nitrogen availability so

1282
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,279
here's a list of

1283
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,599
organic materials that you might

1284
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,760
consider putting into a soil before

1285
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,160
planting berries

1286
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,920
sawdust has a carbon to nitrogen ratio

1287
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:47,358
of 500 to 1. it's hugely deficient in

1288
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,680
nitrogen

1289
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:52,558
bark is a little better straw

1290
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:55,118
80 to 1 is still very low in

1291
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,119
nitrogen

1292
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,078
compost

1293
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,519
as you saw varies quite a bit but might

1294
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,880
be 25

1295
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:05,759
to one

1296
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:11,240
grass clippings 20 to one

1297
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,240
chicken manure down to six six to one

1298
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,039
so we think about these uh um

1299
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:19,519
and

1300
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:23,199
on a stability uh

1301
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:26,400
level so um soils and stable composts

1302
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,439
are in that 25 to 30 to 1

1303
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,519
range

1304
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,559
and for the most part materials in that

1305
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,838
range

1306
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,960
aren't going to either supply nitrogen

1307
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:39,519
available nitrogen or extract available

1308
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,480
nitrogen from from the soil

1309
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:45,599
if you apply materials that

1310
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,559
are increasingly uh

1311
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,440
lower carbon nitrogen ratio so higher

1312
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,599
nitrogen levels you are increasing the

1313
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,318
available nitrogen

1314
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,318
in the soil

1315
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,639
and if you apply materials

1316
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,399
that are increasingly low in nitrogen

1317
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,679
you tend to reduce the available

1318
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,000
nitrogen in the soil so these bark and

1319
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,919
sawdust tend to

1320
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,318
as they decompose the

1321
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,559
microbes that do that work are more

1322
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,719
competitive than plant roots for

1323
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,319
available nitrogen and

1324
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,679
it becomes increasingly difficult for

1325
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:28,000
plants to

1326
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:29,759
extract nitrogen from those soils

1327
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,519
the picture on the bottom is a blueberry

1328
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,920
planting in michigan

1329
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,798
there are several of the

1330
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,200
progressive growers in michigan are

1331
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,039
using wood chips

1332
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,239
incorporating those in the row before

1333
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,480
they plant

1334
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,318
blueberries

1335
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,599
they recognize that they need to

1336
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:51,039
increase nitrogen rates if they do that

1337
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,680
to accommodate

1338
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,199
those the breakdown of those chips but

1339
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,919
the interesting thing and the reason i

1340
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,000
want to mention that is that

1341
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,159
they seem to get growth responses even

1342
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,199
on soils that are pretty high in organic

1343
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,558
matter

1344
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,318
so i think it's

1345
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,720
probably related to the fact that this

1346
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:11,039
is a large particulate matter that

1347
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:13,279
they're adding to a soil

1348
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,279
and often soils that are high in total

1349
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,319
organic matter but it may be

1350
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,680
small

1351
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:22,400
small particles or organic matter

1352
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,480
where the aeration that these chips

1353
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,039
provide seems to really benefit the

1354
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,039
blueberries

1355
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,679
uh kathy is asking what would the

1356
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,079
desired carbon to nitrogen ratio be for

1357
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,519
blueberry for berry crops

1358
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,280
um

1359
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,599
you know and i think

1360
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,599
um

1361
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,559
what i would consider is that you you

1362
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,519
need once a plants are in the ground um

1363
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,000
you

1364
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:57,199
would end up with a carbon nitrogen

1365
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,719
ratio of 20 to 25 i would guess so that

1366
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:59,759
you have a

1367
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,598
modest

1368
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,599
availability of nitrogen

1369
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,358
during the course of the

1370
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:08,960
growing season

1371
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:10,558
i think that

1372
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,000
if you're applying

1373
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,960
these high

1374
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,960
carbon materials you just need to be

1375
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,960
aware of the fact that you'll need to

1376
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,318
increase nitrogen

1377
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,798
supplies

1378
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:28,358
accordingly so i'm not sure there's a

1379
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:28,358
ideal or a desired carbon nitrogen ratio

1380
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,639
and then i wanted to uh talk um just for

1381
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:38,318
a minute about uh learning from one of

1382
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:40,879
my mistakes many mistakes is a couple of

1383
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,838
years ago we established uh organic

1384
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,400
raspberry trail under high tunnels

1385
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,639
and we're concerned that you put these

1386
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,920
raspberries in the ground in

1387
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:51,519
in may

1388
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,039
and they're fall fruiters so they're

1389
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:54,798
going to have a

1390
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,639
nitrogen demand

1391
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:57,440
for the next five months

1392
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:58,960
so

1393
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,760
how do you

1394
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,358
supply nitrogen to those plants

1395
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,799
when rain is excluded it's an organic

1396
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,759
trial so

1397
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:11,519
there are fewer

1398
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,200
materials that you can inject through

1399
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,358
the irrigation system

1400
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:16,558
how do you put something in place in in

1401
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:18,078
may

1402
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,599
prior to planting that's going to

1403
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,960
sustain the plants through the growing

1404
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,519
season so

1405
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:27,199
we ended up incorporating

1406
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:29,519
up to 10 tons of fortified dairy compost

1407
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:33,118
in the rows before we planted so it was

1408
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,960
fortified with feather meal so it was

1409
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,760
somewhat higher in

1410
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,559
nitrogen content

1411
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,160
and this was about june or july after

1412
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,240
may planting

1413
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:50,798
and that's salt stress on on the plants

1414
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:52,479
due to the incorporated uh compost so we

1415
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:54,880
did everything that you're not supposed

1416
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,199
to do and we we analyzed the compost

1417
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,240
after we we put it down and we found

1418
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,719
that it

1419
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,639
ended up being very very high

1420
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,598
concerningly high in

1421
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,400
electrical conductivity or total salts

1422
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,359
and then

1423
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:12,000
carbon to nitrogen ratio of almost eight

1424
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,000
to one so very very high in nitrogen

1425
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,480
very high in salts and we had a lot of

1426
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,119
difficulty with plant

1427
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,880
plant death and poor growth

1428
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,119
because of that i think it would have

1429
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,838
been less of a problem if it weren't

1430
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,599
under high tunnels where we're excluding

1431
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,440
precipitation that would have leached

1432
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,400
some of this material out of the root

1433
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,000
zone

1434
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,639
but

1435
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,639
in any case that was our our lesson

1436
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,199
so in summary um

1437
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,599
i think uh important points are to

1438
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:46,399
understand how the soil texture and the

1439
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:49,280
ph nutrient content drainage varies

1440
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,519
across the site before you consider

1441
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,000
getting ready to plant

1442
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:57,119
understand the properties of all these

1443
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,880
amendments and fertilizers before you

1444
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,160
make applications

1445
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:05,280
with them so under understand what

1446
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:07,679
salt content nutrient content

1447
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,839
and various aspects of these things

1448
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:10,960
before you use them

1449
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:14,480
make sure

1450
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,400
that you adjust ph well before you're

1451
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,000
planting so

1452
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,480
even if you're using a very fine lime

1453
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,440
consider that it's going to take a year

1454
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,119
for that lime to react significantly in

1455
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,200
the in the soil

1456
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,318
even if it's incorporated

1457
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,919
and that goes as well for sulfur

1458
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:34,960
additions where it's going to take some

1459
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,358
time

1460
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,079
and of course build soil phosphorus

1461
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:42,480
potassium calcium magnesium levels based

1462
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,400
on the recommendations a soil test not

1463
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,079
not based on what uh

1464
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,480
what your neighbor has been doing for

1465
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,720
years that seems to to work needs to be

1466
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,440
more scientific than that

1467
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:56,558
so with uh with that that's uh about all

1468
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,039
i wanted to cover um we probably have

1469
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,319
some time for uh questions if anybody

1470
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,280
wants to

1471
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:06,159
uh type something in that i forgot to

1472
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:09,200
cover or didn't cover very clearly

1473
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:12,920
i'd be glad to try to address

1474
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,919
address those questions

1475
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,838
thank you eric for an excellent

1476
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,760
presentation

1477
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,558
while we're waiting for people to pose

1478
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,640
any questions i'm going to shift to the

1479
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,240
exit screen

1480
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:26,558
i want to mention that our speaker for

1481
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:29,199
next the next webinar which is december

1482
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,960
2nd is dr marvin pritz he's going to be

1483
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,798
talking about foliar testing and

1484
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,960
sampling and visual assessment of

1485
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,480
nutrient status

1486
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,639
and i want you to please note that

1487
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,719
webinar number six which was originally

1488
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,400
scheduled for twelve nine had to be

1489
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:44,318
moved to twelve sixteen

1490
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,720
um we apologize for any inconvenience

1491
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,798
with that and the short notice

1492
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:50,159
but uh the webinar will be recorded so

1493
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:51,519
if you're not able to join us on twelve

1494
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,519
sixteen you'll be able to listen to the

1495
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,639
recorded version

1496
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:56,400
if you haven't completed the

1497
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:58,480
demographics questionnaire or the

1498
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,559
educator pretest

1499
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,119
please download those and email the

1500
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:05,680
completed forms to me and while eric is

1501
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,680
answering

1502
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,640
any questions i'm going to open that

1503
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,318
poll again

1504
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,118
if you didn't vote the first time please

1505
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,318
vote again and remember the spear fact

1506
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,680
sheets

1507
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:17,358
you can download those those are

1508
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,279
agronomy fact sheets which have some

1509
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,679
very good uh basic information that

1510
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,440
would be applicable also to berry crops

1511
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:24,798
that marvin provided for us from last

1512
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,079
week

1513
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,599
so here's the poll question 14 that we

1514
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,760
missed

1515
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,318
from the educator pretest the first

1516
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,839
webinar and i'll have that here does

1517
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,838
anyone have any questions for eric

1518
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,838
while we're waiting

1519
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,358
there's a question from glenn

1520
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,199
why not ban sulfur or other nutrients

1521
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,719
instead of broadcast to reduce the

1522
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,960
amount needed

1523
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:55,598
yeah so

1524
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,960
with sulfur

1525
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:02,720
the issue there is if if you band

1526
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,720
in a four or five foot wide band

1527
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:08,078
soils tend to gravitate back to their

1528
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:11,598
initial or native soil ph

1529
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:13,680
so you would have to watch uh more

1530
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,160
carefully how

1531
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,318
soil ph changes over time

1532
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:21,358
and it's likely that you'll have to

1533
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:23,599
apply more uh sulfur more quickly

1534
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,440
underneath the bushes or within that

1535
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,240
band again

1536
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,000
so like i say it probably

1537
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,000
reduces uh

1538
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,880
some

1539
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,519
work in monitoring if you can broadcast

1540
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,760
but if you're working on a heavier soil

1541
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:41,759
where the rate of sulfur

1542
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,559
required is

1543
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:48,720
is cost prohibitive then you may want to

1544
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,720
consider banding under the row

1545
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,519
and then secondly does soil nutrition

1546
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,960
between rows eventually impact plant

1547
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:00,480
supply

1548
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,358
through root extension or soil diffusion

1549
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,798
i'm not sure i

1550
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,519
get that uh entirely but

1551
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,318
i

1552
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:12,838
from my experience uh res digging up

1553
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:15,279
raspberries and and blueberries in

1554
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:16,318
particular there are very few roots that

1555
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,519
extend

1556
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,960
far beyond the canopy of the bush

1557
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:24,079
so

1558
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,920
i think you certainly could supply some

1559
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,079
nutrition

1560
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,599
in row middles but for the most part

1561
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,079
there

1562
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,160
most of the feeder roots of those

1563
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,240
plants tend to be confined underneath

1564
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:36,239
the

1565
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,440
well canopy you again eric for

1566
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,599
sharing this very informative

1567
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,039
presentation with us

1568
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,480
we'll be looking forward to your next

1569
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,039
one

1570
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,719
dan welch will be the webinar host for

1571
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,400
the next two webinars and we'll be

1572
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,318
looking at

1573
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,559
managing nutrients in established

1574
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,000
plantings

1575
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,079
if there aren't any further questions

1576
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,960
we'll close the webinar for today

1577
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,960
thank you for joining us

1578
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,359
