1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,000
University

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:09,330
so hello everybody and thank you very

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,559
much for me here I know it's very early

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,579
in the morning so I and so assistant

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:22,890
told you recently I used to work in the

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:26,309
midde Y at the University and I had just

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,250
finished finished my master's in which I

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,349
did my master in genetics and mechanisms

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,679
of genetic tolerance sorry

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:39,600
mechanism for controlling cold tolerance

12
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:42,149
in rice so I had just finished finished

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,850
my master and I was looking for a PhD

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,799
and was collaborating very closely with

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,439
Uruguayan rice breeding program at that

16
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,179
time I never worked for the UN program

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,988
but I used to collaborate a lot I still

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,539
do so I was looking for a PhD as I said

19
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,058
and they were so the Uruguayan breeding

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,769
program is a small and traditional

21
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,408
breeding program so what they were

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,530
trying to do they were trying to start

23
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,850
to thinking about how to implement

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,899
genomic selection of the breeding

25
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:19,169
program and since I was around I took

26
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:22,319
that task and I decided to send my PhD

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,569
project and this so what I what I try to

28
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:29,490
do is to explore some of the aspects

29
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,990
related to implementing genomic

30
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,818
selection in the rice breeding program

31
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:36,858
and I don't know if I did the best

32
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:41,459
choice but that's how I got here so

33
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:44,068
first of all what where's your way sure

34
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,978
way it's very tiny little country here

35
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,349
in South America and as you can see here

36
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,728
in this map is right in the limit

37
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:55,079
between the sub tropical and temperate

38
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:57,179
zone so for this reason the Uruguayan

39
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,508
climate can be classified as humid

40
00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:04,168
subtropical so we have very well defined

41
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,269
seasons and so the most extreme of

42
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:08,038
course are winter and summer and the

43
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,959
winter runs oops sorry

44
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,449
the winter runs from June to August

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,270
where the average temperature can go

46
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:19,839
between 3 to 10 degrees

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,670
and then we have the summer season that

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,979
runs from December to March where the

49
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:26,849
average temperatures can be between 17

50
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:29,769
to 28 degrees so for this recent thing

51
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:34,269
rice cycle usually takes over during

52
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:37,689
this period and since temperatures

53
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:41,310
during the winter are so low or price we

54
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:41,310
can only have one cycle of rice a year

55
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,860
so then we usually don't tend to

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,920
associate your way right but actually

57
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,590
rice is not merely required but rice is

58
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,679
a third top export you're always mainly

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:02,379
an agricultural country so rice comes

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:04,300
right after beef and soybean and also

61
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,460
your why isn't top is among the top ten

62
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,320
major rice exporters in the world and

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,530
it's actually on the first place in

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,239
Latin America in 95 percent of the rice

65
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,909
production is exported so we're not only

66
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,560
a rice consuming country and for this

67
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:20,020
reason we have to need very high

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,879
standards for grain quality to be able

69
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,409
to export our product in the

70
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:28,449
international market and also as you can

71
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:30,909
see here in this plot up your wayans

72
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:33,359
rice yield are also very high are there

73
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:36,340
between 8 to 10 pounds per hectare and

74
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,340
as we can see here in the plot this is

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,629
the progression of rice yield since

76
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,490
1970s where the rice breeding program

77
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:46,120
was firstly established in the country

78
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,040
and we can see that how grains the grain

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,620
yields were increasing over time and

80
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:53,650
this was thanks to the adoption of new

81
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,349
high yielding varieties but also to the

82
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,110
investment in the adoption of new

83
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:05,769
agricultural practices and also a lot of

84
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:09,340
machinery investment however no so as I

85
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:12,040
said the high yielding varieties from

86
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,840
white were developed by the AMIA which

87
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,709
is the national sorry the national

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,470
cultural and the your wine rice reading

89
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,780
programs belongs to India and this

90
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,970
breeding program consists mainly of its

91
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,519
divided in two main breeding programs

92
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,169
which is the tropical japonica breeding

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,189
program and the indica breeding program

94
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,099
the

95
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:34,990
japonica consists mainly of lines that

96
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,650
were introduced from the u.s. in the 70s

97
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,420
and they were adapted to your wire

98
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:42,819
conditions and the indicator in plasm

99
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,199
consists mainly varieties that were

100
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:49,120
introduced from Colombia and there's

101
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,039
only three main three varieties that

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,740
were released by any account for ninety

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,710
two percent of the area anyway so this

104
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,240
main three varieties are it passes into

105
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:00,189
quality quadrant or Lamar which are

106
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,949
indica varieties and then there's a

107
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:05,649
tropical japonica variety which is in

108
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,930
Yetta body so the main problem we're

109
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,269
facing right now is that these varieties

110
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,420
are reaching their maximal the maximum

111
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,979
yield potential so we are and this was

112
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,319
thanks to all the improvements within

113
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,860
the agricultural practices and machinery

114
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,930
so we're really in the urge to develop

115
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,500
new varieties with higher yield

116
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:34,150
potential and but also yield is not

117
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:36,939
everything in rice grain quality is very

118
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,039
important too and since we export more

119
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,389
most of our production we really need to

120
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,580
eat those high standards and

121
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,418
international markets so the main

122
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:48,039
components of physical quality are

123
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:49,689
length and width which determine which

124
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,160
kind of grain we're having either short

125
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:56,370
medium or long grain and then head rice

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,240
yield is a very important component of

127
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,668
grain quality because red rice yield is

128
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,610
the weight of whole kernels

129
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:08,049
there's nobody likes broken kernels so

130
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,240
this is very important and it really

131
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,668
determines the price of the rice bag in

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,319
the market and then color is important

133
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:16,149
and also chalk is another very important

134
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,029
trade and chalk

135
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:22,979
because chalk really induces grain

136
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:27,039
breakage so it reduces rice yields and

137
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:30,460
chalk is this is this opaque area in the

138
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,490
grains that is caused by miss folding of

139
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,889
the of the amylose and amylopectin

140
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,430
layers during grain feeling so that was

141
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:41,769
this opaque area produces induces frame

142
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,590
breakage so this is a very important

143
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,120
trait to in cry

144
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:50,939
are also important because they also

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,829
induce breakage so we know that men and

146
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:56,219
quality traits and heal are the traits

147
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:59,430
I'm focusing here in my so and we know

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,250
these traits are quantitative traits so

149
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,620
dynamically genomic selection could be a

150
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,740
good strategy to improve these traits

151
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,800
and that's what basically my project was

152
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,680
was to explore different some of the

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,480
aspects of implementing genomic

154
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,750
selection to improve both brain and so

155
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,069
particularly I focused on evaluated the

156
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:29,879
impact of accounting for gie

157
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:33,389
and then also in the gie area I we

158
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,730
compared different ways to fit winner

159
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,939
covariance to feed our models and

160
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,910
improve our prediction accuracy also

161
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,160
another thing it was the use use genomic

162
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,710
selection to select the best

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,880
combinations of parents to cross and

164
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:52,560
start new breeding cycles and and this

165
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,420
is like a bonus track of the thesis

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,519
which is our finding genomic regions

167
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,590
that are associated to intercultural

168
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:02,430
response when we try to develop double

169
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:03,869
haploid lines for breeding so the first

170
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,319
time and the first thing I'm going to

171
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,540
talk to you about is to evaluate how to

172
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,189
evaluate prediction accuracy for yield

173
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,939
and meaning quality when we account for

174
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:17,189
gie in our germ plasm and this is part

175
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:20,639
of our work we published in crop science

176
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:22,969
last year so there's a lot of different

177
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,829
ways to account for you by statistic

178
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:29,130
statistically we were focused mainly on

179
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:31,409
using mixed models and so the mixed

180
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:34,080
model we used had this general form

181
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,610
where we have a trade our response

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,560
variable which is the measurements of

183
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,019
the trades for all genotypes in all

184
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,899
environments then you have our the mean

185
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,179
of the environment and we have this

186
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,699
genetic component which is a random

187
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:50,039
genetic effects and this random this

188
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,259
genetic effects have a normal

189
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,779
distribution with this covariance

190
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,649
structure which can be modeled by the

191
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,720
Kronecker product between two different

192
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,840
one environmental component which is

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,560
this Yui matrix here that represents the

194
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,980
generic covariance between and between

195
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,509
environments and this K is the genetic

196
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,409
covariance between lines that's the

197
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:17,299
genetic component of the model and

198
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:19,579
there's a lot of ways to there's a lot

199
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:22,339
of structures for these generic

200
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,379
covariance between environments so the

201
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,060
two who were focused only in two main

202
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,309
structures which are the actually

203
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:31,419
they're kind of like opposite which is

204
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:34,399
the diagonal matrix and the unstructured

205
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:37,039
matrix so the diagonal matrix what it

206
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,740
does it fits one single variance or

207
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,129
environment and it treats and then

208
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,509
there's no covariance between

209
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:45,950
environments so by this way we're

210
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,480
accounting is the same as fitting

211
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,200
environments or treating them as

212
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,990
independent and we're not sharing

213
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,270
information between environments then

214
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,629
the unstructured covariance matrix as as

215
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:01,610
as the diagonal matrix it fits one

216
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:03,620
single variants per environment but it

217
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,259
also fits a covariance between pairs of

218
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:11,090
environments so we try to compare the

219
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:14,090
our prediction accuracies with the data

220
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,530
sets we used where tropical japonica an

221
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:20,360
indica dataset that consisted both of

222
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,279
300 elite breeding lines and these lines

223
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,180
were evaluated in three different years

224
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:29,600
and the traits we use for yield merely

225
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:31,579
measure does kilograms per hectare then

226
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,379
milling yield head writes percentage and

227
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,080
grain chalkiness these are three the

228
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,779
three main components of quality in

229
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,460
plant height I'm going to explain now

230
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,289
how we phenotype these traits because

231
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:48,680
we're going to refer to them along the

232
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:51,889
whole presentation so when we first get

233
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,859
our harvest our rice from the field we

234
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:57,350
get our patty broth the paddy rice or

235
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,379
rough rice which is the grains that's

236
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,840
still there still attached to the whole

237
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:05,450
so we have to do all these grains to

238
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,320
obtain the brown rice this brown rice

239
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,210
will go then

240
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,220
will pass through the mill and it will

241
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,540
be to obtain the white Christ

242
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,920
after milling we're gonna pain we're

243
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,879
going to attend our white dress with

244
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:23,849
this it constitutes of both whole

245
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,310
Colonels and also broken Colonels so the

246
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,920
total amount of both whole and broken

247
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:33,508
Colonels is a million you relative to

248
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:36,059
the original then the head rise is only

249
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:38,699
when we separate both broken from whole

250
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:43,109
Colonels is the total amount of whole

251
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:45,659
Colonels relative to the original amount

252
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:49,079
of rice and then chalkiness is the third

253
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:51,889
component which is measured as total

254
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:55,078
chalky rice over the total milk rice and

255
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:58,198
chalky grain is a grain is considered as

256
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:01,888
chocolate ice chalky sorry when the

257
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:06,448
chalky area is more than 50 percent of

258
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:08,730
the total brain area for so we used

259
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:10,109
several cross-validation schemes here

260
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,810
I'm going to show you just a few of them

261
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:17,360
so we have we used a cross-validation 1

262
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:20,549
&amp; 2 where the cross-validation one is

263
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,100
fits sorry tries to predict lines that

264
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:25,379
were never evaluated in an environment

265
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,839
so there are new lines and the

266
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,179
cross-validation two predicts lines that

267
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,899
were in valuating environments but not

268
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:35,659
in others so here we're really using

269
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:38,938
information that runs through the

270
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:40,860
environmental covariance matrix and this

271
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:43,799
other results from the prediction

272
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,539
accuracy is for each trade in the indica

273
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,938
dataset and I know there's a lot of

274
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:50,899
things going on in this part but I want

275
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:54,088
you to focus only on this two pink bars

276
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,240
for each year in each trade these two

277
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,189
pink - pink bars correspond to the

278
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,669
cross-validation scheme - the one when

279
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:05,429
we try to predict I said we're said

280
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:07,860
we're sorry tested in some environments

281
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,969
but not in others using the unstructured

282
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,110
covariance matrix so then these are

283
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,889
actually the only ones that are kind of

284
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:20,220
like more different than the rest and

285
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:22,320
for tropical japonica we see

286
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,960
the same trend but not as pronounced as

287
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,730
with the indicas again using the

288
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,590
cross-validation - with the unstructured

289
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,990
covariance matrix we're not we can

290
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:34,330
achieve the better prediction accuracy

291
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,549
and another crossword engine scenario we

292
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,610
tested and I'm going to tell you when I

293
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,990
talk about today is when we were trying

294
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,050
to predict new environment so

295
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,480
environments that were never like

296
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,459
developed before right in our case since

297
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
environments are years we're trying to

298
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,780
predict future years using the

299
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,289
information from previous years and the

300
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:59,769
training population so here we can see

301
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:01,599
when predicting every each year for both

302
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,879
the Indy kind of tropical japonica for

303
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,620
each trade using the diagonal and then

304
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,559
structural covariance matrix and we can

305
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,720
see that in each case prediction address

306
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,559
is a little higher when using the onion

307
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,690
structural covariance matrix than so

308
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,459
actually using this kind of fitting

309
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,010
these kinds of models that allow us to

310
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,170
borrow information between environments

311
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:26,860
really help us predict our lines to

312
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:29,319
achieve better prediction accuracy so as

313
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:34,509
a summary of this part again the

314
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,190
structure models when you fit in usually

315
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,899
under the cross validation two scenario

316
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:43,300
give birth prediction accuracy stand

317
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:47,939
when using covariance matrices and also

318
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:49,899
using these types of matrices are

319
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,240
beneficial when we try to predict

320
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,509
untested years and also this is also

321
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,269
true because in the case of the

322
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,049
unstructured covariance matrix the

323
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:02,230
correlations of covariances between

324
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:04,569
environments were very high so for these

325
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,430
reasons this those high correlations

326
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,590
really improve our prediction accuracy

327
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:11,589
with these types of matrices and this

328
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,509
basically responds to the stable weather

329
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:19,060
conditions in other Y where there's no

330
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:20,919
major weather event so usually I mean

331
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,959
weather is stable there's still

332
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:27,729
variation but there's no big variation

333
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,320
right so using again using GBM models

334
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,070
that account for G by E and that account

335
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:36,340
for correlations between environments

336
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:39,190
traits so now this is another study

337
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,040
where we also used two body models but

338
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,350
here what we wanted to do was to feed

339
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,689
our models with weather data to be able

340
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,050
to model our environments in a better

341
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,000
way so the objectives here were to

342
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,979
explore different ways to include this

343
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,500
weather covariance in our models because

344
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,509
the problem that we have when we use

345
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,700
weather covariance can be similar than

346
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:02,620
when we use molecular markers weather

347
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,870
covariance can be too many and can they

348
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,509
can be correlated they can be highly

349
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,779
correlated between each other so it's

350
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:14,950
not easy to fit these types of models

351
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:17,829
and also another objective was to try to

352
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:21,400
study the genetic basis of G body in our

353
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:23,379
own classes so the environmental

354
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,029
covariance we used where they were

355
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,500
retrieved from the weather station in

356
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,659
the rice training program like right

357
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,809
when the where the lines were evaluated

358
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:34,389
in the same field and they were they

359
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:37,539
consisted of either temperature Sun

360
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,189
solar radiation precipitation and they

361
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:43,689
were daily measurements for all these

362
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:45,460
different components and basically we

363
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,710
know that this covariance they're not

364
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,230
going to affect on the same way in each

365
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,310
state of the of the growth of the plant

366
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,680
growth so we try to calculate so we try

367
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,899
to like try to short those covariance to

368
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:03,129
different stages so we can kind of we

369
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:08,250
can model it more accurately so we try

370
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:08,250
to divide our plans sorry our yeah the

371
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,019
the rice growth into three main

372
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,799
different phonological stages which were

373
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:20,819
vegetative reproductive and maturity

374
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,319
reproductive powering and so the prime

375
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,838
is that we didn't have the information

376
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,809
of which at what time in the field

377
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,149
plants were at each stage so what we

378
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,059
used to calculate this stages was the

379
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:36,300
flowering time and we know usually the

380
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:39,149
flowering stage from booting to

381
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,740
flowering takes about 35 days so based

382
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,540
on these measurements and we know that

383
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,720
plants are left in the field after

384
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,180
flowering for about 30 days for brain

385
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,220
feeling and knowing they're late the

386
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,610
date of planting and harvesting we can

387
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:56,309
calculate this stage for our plants in

388
00:17:53,609 --> 00:18:00,119
the field so we calculated that were

389
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:05,069
covariates your averages over this all

390
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:08,309
these stages for both tropical japonica

391
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:10,919
and the indica data sets and here the

392
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,710
data sets we use were the same as in the

393
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,350
previous work the only difference was

394
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,110
that the tropical japonica dataset had

395
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:21,209
two more years of evaluation and the

396
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:23,729
traits used for grain yield had rice

397
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,490
percentage chalkiness and height than

398
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,799
height as a control for a trade that is

399
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,950
not controlled by the environment so

400
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,619
much and we try to compare two main

401
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,230
different types of statistical models

402
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,000
here so we have on one side the reaction

403
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:43,559
norm models that were developed by the

404
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,869
Harkey and the PLS are models which pls

405
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,889
R stands for partial list for regression

406
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:51,509
models so for the for the reaction now

407
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,259
your models we tried three different

408
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:57,509
models which one that only models the

409
00:18:54,259 --> 00:19:00,240
genetic the genetic effects the were

410
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:01,529
model using this effects are random so

411
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,680
they were modeled using the covariance

412
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:07,710
matrix between in between sorry between

413
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,810
genotypes then we have a G + W model

414
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,640
that has a genetic component denoted

415
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,500
component in an environment component

416
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,120
and the environment component was

417
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,750
modeled using the environmental

418
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,519
covariance sorry the the matrix of

419
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,470
environmental covariance or the matrix

420
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:28,048
of covariance between the vertical

421
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:31,110
and G plus W plus GW model adds this

422
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:34,079
interaction term between genotypes and

423
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:35,908
an environment and this term is model by

424
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:41,428
using the multiplicative product between

425
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:43,409
the two relationship matrix matrices on

426
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,179
the other hand we have the pls R models

427
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:47,820
and basically what pls our models do

428
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,220
they decompose our data into latent

429
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:52,980
variables and these latent variables are

430
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,288
linear combinations and what they try to

431
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,490
do is to maximize the covariance between

432
00:19:55,288 --> 00:20:01,980
our response and our predictors so which

433
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,620
here we try the pls T model which was

434
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,950
only using Martin's detectors and the

435
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:12,388
pls GW model using both markers and

436
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:15,210
environmental covariance and these are

437
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:16,709
the results for the sorry I I don't know

438
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,210
why they show they don't show up here

439
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,169
but these are the results for the

440
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,960
prediction accuracy in both datasets and

441
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:26,750
here in blue to predict each year so

442
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,669
here we're trying to predict new years

443
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:34,048
so the bars the blue bars here represent

444
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:39,389
the the reaction model and the red or

445
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:41,308
orange bars represent the pls so we can

446
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:43,199
see that for the indicas and also for

447
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:46,168
the for the japonica's was Mowgli from

448
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,350
the amigas the pls our models gave

449
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,940
better prediction accuracies or equal

450
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:55,099
prediction accuracy stand their reaction

451
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,788
norms but usually this orange part which

452
00:20:55,099 --> 00:21:00,418
represents

453
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:03,119
pls using both molecular markers and

454
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,950
environmental covariance they they

455
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,288
usually give a little higher prediction

456
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,830
accuracy so we can see it here to

457
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:12,690
further japonica's so basically and for

458
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:14,609
these data sets we obtain better

459
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,680
prediction accuracy when using these

460
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:21,240
types of models the the pls our models

461
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,029
also as I said in the introduction we

462
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,450
tried to explore the genetic basis of G

463
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:31,980
by E from our germ plasm and what we did

464
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:34,500
was we perform a G was or each year each

465
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,490
trade in each environment sorry yeah

466
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,980
each year and we could only we are here

467
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,890
we can only find significant q tears

468
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,960
forehead rise and chalkiness in both

469
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,730
datasets we couldn't find any

470
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,740
significant cutie else in an environment

471
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:55,319
or brain yield so what we did here so

472
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,120
this all these cutie ELLs have

473
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,490
differential different effects in

474
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,159
different environments right so what we

475
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,380
try to do here was to test all these

476
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,590
kikyo's for interaction with our weather

477
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,810
covariance and we use this model that

478
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:12,659
was developed by Marco Marco hello city

479
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:15,089
which fits a mania environment effect a

480
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,700
TTL main effect aquí te lo environment

481
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:19,500
affect and the QTL by sorry kidding back

482
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,410
et al by environmental covariant effect

483
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,059
and then there's a QTL by environment

484
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:28,170
and the genetic effects which are random

485
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:32,399
effects here and what we could only find

486
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:35,009
significant interactions for two of our

487
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,490
two tiel's in the indica dataset and

488
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:41,039
we're both forehead and the weather

489
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:45,870
covariates were mainly related well

490
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:52,099
first of all we try with interaction

491
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:54,659
with covariance that we're doing and

492
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:57,629
this were weather covariance related to

493
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,310
precipitation and humidity for one TTL

494
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,060
and for the other TTL related to

495
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:04,319
temperature and basically the similar

496
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,349
situation here in the tropical

497
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,960
japonica's we found one key teal for

498
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:13,949
head rise percentage showed significant

499
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,809
interaction with environmental

500
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,350
covariance through maturity two related

501
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:22,549
to precipitation and humidity and for

502
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:24,659
chalkiness this key TL showed

503
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:26,970
interaction with covariance that were

504
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,660
related to minimum temperature and

505
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,950
precipitation and this was unexpected

506
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,350
because we

507
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,048
know from previous studies that usually

508
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:40,199
grain choppiness is in the tropics it's

509
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:42,119
mainly affected by high temperatures so

510
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,038
but usually the high temperatures in the

511
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,629
tropics the ones that affect brain

512
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:51,240
chalkiness are those are higher however

513
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,909
in other white temperatures maximum

514
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,370
temperatures that during brain fill in

515
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:59,519
stage they never reach they're always

516
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:03,349
lower that so it could be possible that

517
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:07,048
for chalkiness in in Hawaii and also

518
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:09,028
maybe another temperate or subtropical

519
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:11,099
areas where temperatures are not as high

520
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:14,038
as in the tropics maybe there's other

521
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:17,148
weather components that might be

522
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:20,398
affecting this trade it could be either

523
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:22,079
temperature or also like solar radiation

524
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:24,750
and there's some physiological studies

525
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,579
with you and within the UI and germ

526
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:33,000
plasm that the breeders are doing nude

527
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:35,609
or white that also point so that was all

528
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,589
about genotype by environment direction

529
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:40,439
here we're moving to a different topic

530
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:44,220
or what we try to do were to was to

531
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,519
select to explore how to use genomic

532
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:53,220
prediction to the best combinations of

533
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:55,888
parents for breeding and so what we try

534
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,528
to do here was to first of all for the

535
00:24:55,888 --> 00:25:00,750
first objective was we try to see how

536
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:03,058
many crosses in common would have when

537
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,429
we select our crosses based on the only

538
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:07,079
mean which is easily predicted when the

539
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,750
progeny means sorry which is easily

540
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,519
predicted by the mid parent value or by

541
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,210
using a combination of both the mean and

542
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,579
the under variance in our progeny the

543
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:19,769
variance is a little harder to predict

544
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:22,308
we and for to predict the variance in

545
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:25,470
our simulated progeny fluid simulations

546
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:27,349
and also we try to follow a different

547
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,120
selection criteria for improving

548
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:33,928
negatively correlated traits so usually

549
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:36,268
in rice grain yield and milling quality

550
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,639
are negatively correlated so we wanted

551
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:43,808
to see different ways you can improve

552
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:46,269
all our traits traits simultaneously

553
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:48,249
this was all done doing simulations but

554
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:49,808
also we have some of the crosses that

555
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:52,389
were simulated here were actually

556
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:55,178
performing a greenhouse so we try to

557
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:56,678
compare our predicted values so this

558
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,359
cross is the progeny from those process

559
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,249
was actually evaluated in the field in

560
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:02,528
order Y so we try to compare the

561
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:04,989
prediction accuracy that we had for

562
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:09,308
those crosses with actual field data

563
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:11,679
from the field so this is a summary of

564
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:13,690
what we did we first started from a

565
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,028
training population that consisted of

566
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,399
three hundred tropical japonica lines

567
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:20,528
and they breeding lines these were

568
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,798
planted in other Y and we firstly

569
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:28,868
performed 19 crosses between these lines

570
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:31,719
of this our training population we we

571
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:32,978
brought the f1 seed here to Cornell and

572
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:35,019
we planted it in the greenhouse

573
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:38,798
so this families were in the greenhouse

574
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:43,179
and we advanced at them up to f4 and

575
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:45,519
then with genotyped everything then we

576
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:48,909
also perform a hundred and eighty five

577
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,759
random crosses between this nineteen

578
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:53,710
families trying to do by bare white

579
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,098
trying to cross individuals from

580
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:03,848
different families and the progeny the

581
00:26:57,098 --> 00:27:06,878
f1 from these crosses was sent to where

582
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:10,778
we could only obtain 43 double-homicide

583
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:16,449
of 185 f1 seed here and all these

584
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:26,588
families worse than valuation so this is

585
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:29,229
just as I said grain yield and this

586
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:31,569
wasn't the exception so here you can see

587
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:33,909
that grain yield is correlated with both

588
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:36,069
milling yield and head rice percentage

589
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,719
and it's also positively correlated with

590
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,999
grain chocolate but what we actually

591
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:43,349
want to do is to reduce chocolate so

592
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:48,190
this positive correlation is undesirable

593
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:51,189
we use so to make the 19 crosses here

594
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:54,070
between members of this relation we

595
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,960
would perform a cluster analysis here so

596
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:59,418
we could detect by different

597
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,490
groups in this population and we try to

598
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,820
cross individuals between different

599
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,370
groups as a way to preserve the original

600
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:09,019
diversity in the training population and

601
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:16,308
then we try to cross also individuals

602
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:18,648
that were good for one trade so these

603
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:22,538
are the results as I told you we make

604
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:25,099
them okay as I told you we made this

605
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:28,220
process in the field and why but we

606
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:32,298
brought the f1 seed here to pour now we

607
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,669
planted in the greenhouse and we we

608
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:37,339
genotype everything so these are the

609
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:42,288
results and the simulation for each for

610
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:44,990
each for each trade so we tried we we

611
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:48,288
simulated all the possible combinations

612
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:53,630
between these 19 families and we

613
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:56,690
calculated the mean and the variance and

614
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,149
here we can see the mean the mean of

615
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,340
each progeny versus the progeny variants

616
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:04,009
here

617
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:07,278
so from these progenies we try to select

618
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:09,288
the top hunt the top 100 individuals

619
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:14,028
that we're either that high had either

620
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:16,879
the highest mean which is this which are

621
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:20,980
these red dots here and I'm sorry the

622
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,770
reference here I don't know they got and

623
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:27,558
then we try to select the top 100

624
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:30,879
individuals that had both the sorry

625
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:35,509
where the the the top 100 progenies

626
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,528
where with the maximum yield I'm sorry

627
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:40,579
with a maximum

628
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:43,159
mean of the top 10 of the top 10% of the

629
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:45,558
population so this would be a

630
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,770
combination of selecting based on both

631
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:50,389
mean and variance and in purple here we

632
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:52,609
can see the crosses in common between

633
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,399
the two methods which are depicted here

634
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:57,168
so here we can see that we have more

635
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:04,629
crosses in common for grain yield and

636
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:04,630
for the other traits we could maybe four

637
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:13,019
so maybe for grain yield you suggest the

638
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,849
mean of the between their parents to

639
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,620
predict our best process maybe that

640
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:19,709
could be a good option and it's the

641
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:22,349
easiest option but also for the men in

642
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,850
quality trades we might want to evaluate

643
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:25,949
whether using the mean between the

644
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:28,048
parents or a combination of the mean and

645
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,880
the variance in the progeny would be the

646
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:32,058
best option because we don't have so

647
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,059
many

648
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:37,899
and here this is to show you the

649
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:42,549
correlated response between the trades

650
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:45,759
so in the simulations - so here we can

651
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,740
see that usually of course grain yield a

652
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,789
milling yield in this between these 19

653
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,210
families they have a negative

654
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:54,490
correlation but for between granule and

655
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,190
head rise percentage the correlation is

656
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,529
not that so there's and we can see that

657
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,750
- here in the decisive distribution of

658
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:05,740
the correlations between the trades

659
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:08,049
along across all the colonies so even

660
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,849
though this distribution is skewed to

661
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,769
the negative side we can see there's

662
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:14,529
some progenies that still have a

663
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,150
positive correlation so there's still

664
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:20,230
room for improvement here in the

665
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:24,130
curation so what we try to do here was

666
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:26,230
to simulate sorry to try to select

667
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:31,540
different evaluate different selection

668
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:35,380
schemes to improve both and you see so

669
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:38,019
the main three first three selection

670
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,730
schemes we use for they differed on the

671
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,889
selection and which trade we were

672
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,650
applying the strongest selection

673
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:47,530
pressure so the first one was firstly

674
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,840
selecting based on temperature 10% up

675
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:50,910
10% lines based based on yield and from

676
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,349
there

677
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:56,470
selecting based on the other quality

678
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:58,689
trades and the second one was selecting

679
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,610
first for head rise and then based on

680
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,100
the other trades and the third one was

681
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:05,229
selecting first or chalkiness than the

682
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:09,579
other two and then we also evaluated a

683
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:11,200
multiplicative index where where we can

684
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:15,189
see there all the trade simultaneously

685
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,750
here and here this X is the value for

686
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,210
that progeny is the meaning for that

687
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,849
party mean for that trade and this K

688
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,470
here is the minimum value or its low

689
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:26,740
weight value or the highest in the case

690
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,860
chocolates for that trait in across

691
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,480
whole projects

692
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:34,918
and then we go so we took the the top 25

693
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,000
crosses from each that were selected

694
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:43,590
from each selection scheme and mean of

695
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,599
those progeny sorry and we subtracted

696
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:49,369
that mean from that sorry we subtracted

697
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,369
the meaning the training population

698
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:59,579
selection and so for selection scheme 1

699
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:01,528
you see that we had the highest response

700
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,759
to selection for grain yield but they're

701
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:06,269
responsible selection for the other

702
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:09,329
melon quality traits was very low on the

703
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:13,109
other hand using selection scheme - we

704
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:16,859
have a low we had a lower response for

705
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:21,928
yield but we had a higher response and

706
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:24,119
also the second best scheme was the

707
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:30,480
multiplicative index so this could be

708
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:33,808
something we want to use in these types

709
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,829
of indices when we want to breed for

710
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:40,259
these traits in contingency then this is

711
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:43,939
a so that was for the simulations and

712
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:47,759
this part is about the evaluations or

713
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,980
families feel so again as I told you we

714
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:54,480
only could recover 43 double haploid

715
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:57,558
families out of 185 f1c he sent so we

716
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,558
didn't have the chance to like

717
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:06,919
everything and everything and so we

718
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:09,869
calculated the means for each family and

719
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:12,329
since the problem we had here was that

720
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:14,159
this lines arrived too late but why they

721
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:16,918
arrived on December so they were planted

722
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,780
late actually 3 months after the regular

723
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:24,719
rice schedule so for this reason we

724
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,940
think that grain yield was so low if we

725
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,408
compared here this is a meaning the for

726
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,820
each trade in the training population as

727
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:35,190
a reference so yield was very low but on

728
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,460
the other hand for milling quality for

729
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,349
milling yield and hair dries the the

730
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,490
means for these traits were actually a

731
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,480
little better than the training

732
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:45,569
population

733
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,030
and this was surprising for us the mean

734
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:51,480
for grain chalkiness was very low

735
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,580
compared to the training populations was

736
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,340
unexpected because these lines were

737
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:59,069
during maturity they were they went to

738
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,680
they were maturity during during the

739
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:06,150
fall season so temperatures can be very

740
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,679
localized and but it was it's a good

741
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,119
result

742
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:13,529
because we want to minimize chalkiness

743
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,289
these are the trade correlations between

744
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,990
these families and the correlations are

745
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:20,670
low but again since I mean the

746
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:22,949
correlations between yield and the other

747
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:27,000
minute quality traits are actually non

748
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:28,739
significant but again as our plants they

749
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,909
were planted late and I will heal was so

750
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:36,439
low because weather conditions we can't

751
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:38,549
take this very I mean we this plants are

752
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,740
there right now in the field they were

753
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,480
planted again for a new evaluation and

754
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:46,019
appropriate time so we're waiting for

755
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:50,990
that data to to make more informed

756
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:53,969
decisions the results of this analysis

757
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:55,559
so the other so what we try to do was to

758
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:57,599
compare our prediction accuracy is for

759
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:00,150
these families with the actual data from

760
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,730
the field and so what we did with we

761
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,740
perform genomic prediction on our lines

762
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,559
but L had our prediction accuracy is

763
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:11,339
four families then we had the evaluation

764
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,949
from the field we ran both predictions

765
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,160
and the field data and we compared with

766
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:19,829
the top 10% and we compared which ones

767
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:22,799
which ones on up 10% for the predictions

768
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:25,108
where in the work correspond we're also

769
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,109
in the top 10% for the field evaluations

770
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:31,259
and again for grain yield we could only

771
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:34,590
find one family this family was in

772
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,450
common between the two rankings but for

773
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:40,369
but again since they were planted late

774
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:40,368
we need actually like better data to

775
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,480
to examine the role of genomic selection

776
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,250
for grain yield but here for milling

777
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,059
quality traits we found four families

778
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,010
out of ten

779
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:52,559
where in common between the two rankings

780
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,150
and forebrain chalkiness six families

781
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,579
out of ten

782
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:00,559
where common limit between the two

783
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:04,590
predictions sorry the two rankings so

784
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,779
again we are waiting for for more data

785
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,240
to analyze from yield but this is

786
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,950
actually this is promising for us

787
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:15,750
because could be a great genomic

788
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:20,189
selection rates in inverted milling

789
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:23,039
quality traits in rice so that was

790
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,639
everything about genomic prediction now

791
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:30,029
this is a bonus track and I'm gonna go

792
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:34,199
past here but since I told you we only

793
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:37,109
we could only obtain 43 actually a

794
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,539
little more they work before that we'll

795
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:40,108
have those families out of 185 everyone

796
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,559
see

797
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:46,889
so our eye were the hub low yield was

798
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:48,989
very low so we try to see what we're

799
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:51,118
trying to do was to explore our germ

800
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:53,909
plasm or after culture and the culture

801
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,400
is the is the process to obtain that

802
00:37:53,909 --> 00:38:01,409
will have three lines in rice so we try

803
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:04,170
to to to explore our germ plasm for

804
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:07,049
genomic regions associated to enter

805
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:10,108
culture in in our tropical japonica

806
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:12,810
lines and mainly anton cutter culture

807
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:14,880
consists of two main steps which are

808
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,710
colors induction and plant regeneration

809
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,519
and these are the two main bottlenecks

810
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,920
of the process so we and we know also

811
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,349
that the response to anther culture is

812
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,659
highly dependent on the donor genotype

813
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:30,930
and usually indica lines are the least

814
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:33,029
responsive among all lines tropical

815
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:36,149
japonica varieties are usually are

816
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:39,500
easier usually to regenerate but there's

817
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,500
some variation

818
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:48,969
so our objective was to identify qtls

819
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:53,728
for college both callous induction and

820
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:59,139
plan regeneration in our top-load lines

821
00:38:53,728 --> 00:39:02,528
so our data set consisted of 191 lines

822
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:04,690
that belonged to 50 families where all

823
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:07,028
the double hop look families were cut we

824
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,809
could recover after the agriculture

825
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:13,449
process and the traits were Cali

826
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:17,349
transfer third dish this is a measure

827
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:19,930
was a measurement of colors induction a

828
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:22,449
number of plants regenerated per collars

829
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:26,108
which is a an idea of is a measurement

830
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:28,239
of language generation and then the

831
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:30,909
number of panicles per each regenerated

832
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,159
plant this gives us an idea of the

833
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:35,318
bigger plants because usually plants

834
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,538
regenerate by not usually but sometimes

835
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:39,909
plan for generate and then we transfer

836
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:45,249
them to the greenhouse and they they die

837
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:47,199
or they have very low yield and then the

838
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:49,929
genotyping was done using an Xterra

839
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:56,709
library and we had a total of about 69

840
00:39:49,929 --> 00:40:01,149
thousand markers these are the results

841
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:04,228
for where G was for callus induction and

842
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:07,209
here we could identify for qtls

843
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:10,468
that were in distributed along

844
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:13,868
chromosomes to seven eleven and twelve

845
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:15,818
then for plans for collars we could find

846
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:19,059
a lot more qtls we found a total of

847
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:22,509
twelve qtls here and some of these QTL

848
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,940
were in mainly this one in chromosome to

849
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:29,349
whistle was also co-located with this

850
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:32,108
one for induction and these key days

851
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:34,949
were also distributed along chromosomes

852
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:38,949
2 3 5 6 7 8 &amp; 9

853
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:41,430
and finally for pinnacles per plant we

854
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:44,769
had we found a total of five qtls

855
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:46,538
and this this QTL also co-located with

856
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:49,848
this with the second TTL

857
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:53,719
found here for plants per Collis

858
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:56,119
so we made our literature search to find

859
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:58,190
which kikyo's word for these traits were

860
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,999
previously reported in other studies and

861
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,159
we found a total of a QTL to among the

862
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:08,389
one we found or previously reported

863
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:11,239
reported in other studies so um these

864
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:13,728
results are exciting of course this is a

865
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,579
first step we just identify the key

866
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:20,058
tiel's then we have to go more more

867
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:22,880
deeply into fine mapping and possibly

868
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:27,528
identify on CASL genes under these two

869
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,690
tails but this is um this is exciting so

870
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:32,509
that's about all I wanted to tell you

871
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:35,329
today I this is the acknowledgement

872
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:38,269
parts so now I want to first thank my

873
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:41,180
committee my advisory system a couch and

874
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:43,458
the other members of my committee John

875
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:47,929
Luke and Philip and also Lucia which is

876
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:49,909
in Madison now I also want to thank the

877
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:52,248
breeders in the rice prison program

878
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:55,670
anemia which we could get all the data

879
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:59,298
from them and also the people from

880
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:01,459
biotechnology and statistics and also

881
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:04,639
the current and former members of them a

882
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:06,018
couch lab we sandy and Cassie for taking

883
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,690
care of my plants and helping me with

884
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:10,698
the crosses and you Xin and Francisco

885
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,099
for helping me with older biotechnology

886
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:16,278
I sort of further bioinformatic analysis

887
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:18,729
and of course Giovanni Vishnu Mooney who

888
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:21,829
sadly left us too soon

889
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:24,739
Diane in front of Eid for sharing office

890
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:32,028
time and conversation so thank you very

891
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:35,269
much for me this has been a production

892
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:38,679
of Cornell University on the web at

893
