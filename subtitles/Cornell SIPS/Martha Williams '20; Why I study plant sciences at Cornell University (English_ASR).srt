00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:06,528
University hello my name is Martha

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,730
Williams and I'm studying plant science

4
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:10,460
in the school of integrative plant

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,170
sciences because I love connections ever

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,519
since I was a little girl I used to see

7
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,199
how the plants in the soil

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,690
became the food that was on my dinner

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,910
table and as I've grown older I realized

10
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,949
that plants not only feed the body but

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,750
nourish the soul they bridge this gap

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,250
that we have between the technological

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,990
world we've created and the natural

14
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,778
world from which we have distanced

15
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:31,278
ourselves they build community for

16
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,570
example I had the opportunity this

17
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,390
summer to work with a handful of

18
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,009
children who work to plan and garden

19
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,230
plant this garden and maintain this

20
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,640
garden I watched how amazed they were

21
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:42,949
the same that they look at their

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,359
technology looking at the plants that

23
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,789
they were growing in the ground and I

24
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,289
saw how and all they were that their

25
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,270
hands are able to create an edible

26
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:53,149
garden that they were able to tell how

27
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:57,559
the this these plants had nourished them

28
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,939
and I hope at my time here at Cornell

29
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,558
that I continue to build these

30
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,988
connections because these connections

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,179
aren't singular to young people there's

32
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:08,060
they are shared between people of all

33
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,770
age groups and I hope to not only build

34
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,609
these connections but build community

35
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,609
thank you
