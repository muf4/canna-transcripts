1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:12,839
so today I am going to be talking about

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:16,739
my work on genomics of insect and

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:19,920
nematode pathogens and I thought I would

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,649
start out broadly just introducing the

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,280
where do we find in sec pathogens in the

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:29,879
fungi and there's really two and two

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,589
three or three major groups the or belay

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,049
leaves which are these are these are

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:37,590
ascomycete fungi this is a phylogeny of

12
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,959
the ascomycota and in the orbit lilies

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,210
we have a lot of nematode trapping fungi

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,810
so these are these organisms that live

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,980
in soil their infamous for forming these

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:53,640
lassies that capture and actively trap

17
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:56,250
nematodes in soil another big group of

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,159
in particularly the insect pathogens are

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,899
in the sir dario my seeds and

20
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,308
particularly in the order hypo creole

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,439
eaves and so here's some charismatic

22
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:09,298
these are the charismatic fungi growing

23
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,059
out of this is growing out of a I think

24
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,549
it's a silkworm pupa so cordyceps fungus

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,159
very brightly colored and then there are

26
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,760
also very various shapes that grow out

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,070
of beetles

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,070
this is actually to ly palladium

29
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:28,489
attempted to pronounce growing out of

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,990
wood but underneath there is a beetle so

31
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,298
many of these fungi infect wood-boring

32
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,759
beetles for example and so here's here's

33
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,260
a decaying log with twopical a diem

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,380
coming out and actually spore you

35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,728
leading the lab a bony Ally's are not

36
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,839
actually insect pathogens but they are

37
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:50,000
ectoparasites and they're actually

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,070
sexually transmitted so like humans

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,759
Roger I have have nutritional make

40
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,438
nutritional choices so this is the hypo

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,790
creole as I just wanted to introduce you

42
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,908
to the order because I'm going to be

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,670
talking about them quite a bit today and

44
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,849
that's origin right here it includes

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,530
organisms like Fusarium I hope everyone

46
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,709
has here in this department has heard

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,090
about Fusarium a major pathogen of a lot

48
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:20,310
of grasses and an other plants

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,000
so in green I'm showing the plant

50
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,860
associate

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,650
members of hypocretin or their plants a

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,620
probes that degrade they also degrade

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:35,099
decaying plant material we can call them

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,140
the vegetarians and then at the

55
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,810
transition to the hypo cream so that's

56
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,089
sort of the basil the basil group of the

57
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,539
hypo Creole ease our plant associated

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,370
and then as we move to this node in the

59
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,129
phylogeny we have a shift to both

60
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,710
microparasites so micro figgus window

61
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,109
that attack other fungi things like

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,709
trichoderma which are used for bio

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,050
control and then here we have actually

64
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,810
two independent origins of insect and

65
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,330
nematode pathogens we'll call these the

66
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,939
true meat eaters they actually infect

67
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,380
insects and nematodes and use them as a

68
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,659
food source there they're looking

69
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:17,280
they're good nitrogen source insects and

70
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:20,579
nematodes I would say that that life so

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,379
this is a very nice tidy story I would

72
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,959
say that real life is a little bit more

73
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:28,169
complicated and in fact one of the

74
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,110
things that I'm interested in are the

75
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,539
variation in hosts across these fungi so

76
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,110
this this is was a phylogeny done by a

77
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,479
former postdoc in my postdoc lab that

78
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,920
tracks again tracks host associations

79
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:47,369
green is plant associated blue is fungal

80
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,919
hosts associated and red is insect or

81
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,509
animal associated and you can see there

82
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,238
have been a lot of host shifts within

83
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,699
the hypocracy so these fungi are

84
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,189
commonly shifting hosts from being plant

85
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,738
parasites inside parasites to nematode

86
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,419
parasites to fungal parasites and that's

87
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,390
a very interesting aspect of their

88
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:10,229
ecology and interestingly there are also

89
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,449
some members even the same strains that

90
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:15,869
can do both so you've probably heard

91
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,329
about a fungus called meadow rhythm it's

92
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,728
a very commonly known insect pathogen

93
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,959
but it also grows its rises to a

94
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,300
competent and it grows in the

95
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,430
rhizosphere and it has actually also

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,340
been shown to be endo FIDIC and so it

97
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,379
has both aspects of this lifestyle in

98
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:35,750
its ecology similarly bavaria bastiana

99
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:38,750
a very good wide hoe strange insect

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,459
pathogen also colonizes plants as an end

101
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,399
of fight and so one of the things I'm

102
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:47,599
interested in is this dual aspects of

103
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,889
the ecology of these fungi so today I'm

104
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,810
going to tell you a few stories about

105
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:55,189
some different projects that I'm working

106
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,819
on the first is really a file of genomic

107
00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:01,550
analysis of the order hypo crazy

108
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:04,069
looking at changes in primary metabolism

109
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,829
and how those might shift at this change

110
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:11,019
or transition from the plant associated

111
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:13,039
host to insect or make a parasitic host

112
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,769
that I'm going to tell you a little bit

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,840
about tell a palladium inflate them

114
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:19,729
particularly oxidative enzymes and

115
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,489
secondary the role of oxidative enzymes

116
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,939
and secondary metabolites in insect

117
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,460
pathogenesis and that a project I have

118
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:31,069
working on beginning working on Bavaria

119
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,319
bastiana which is an insect pathogen and

120
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,449
we're looking at really trying to look

121
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,849
at interest specific genetic diversity

122
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:40,939
in this in this species in terms of

123
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,860
secondary metabolite potential what what

124
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,930
can what can these fungi produced and

125
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,949
how does that affect their virulence or

126
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,769
their ecology and finally end with some

127
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:56,750
work on nematode parasites that that I

128
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:58,810
have a project working on so so you

129
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,980
think about primary metabolism

130
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,490
associated with the transition from

131
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,920
plant to insect nutritional nodes or

132
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,519
host we actually need to think about

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,800
some of the carbon sources and nitrogen

134
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,500
sources that these fungi might encounter

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,189
on both of those hosts so in plants

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,439
obviously we have cellulose lignin

137
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:23,810
pectin Hemi cellulose all these things

138
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,980
are things that a fungus might need to

139
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,189
be able to digest

140
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,890
whereas in fungal parasites and insect

141
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:34,069
parasites we oftentimes have chitin as

142
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:38,719
the primary polymer of the cell wall of

143
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:40,339
fungi and also cuticle of insects and so

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,270
that's just to kind of summarize the

145
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:47,158
barriers that a fungus might find to to

146
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:49,288
attack a plant versus an insect so

147
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:52,819
in a plant we have an outer protective

148
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:55,528
layer composed of wax cute and cute Ain

149
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:59,129
in an insect we also have what's called

150
00:06:55,528 --> 00:07:01,110
the EPI cuticle which in fact is a

151
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,959
little bit of a waxy layer as well

152
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,949
it contains actually has some long-chain

153
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:11,309
hydrocarbons or alkane compounds as well

154
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:14,158
as fatty acids polyphenols and slur to

155
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:18,929
noise protein so that's really the first

156
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:21,868
barrier for a plant pathogen versus an

157
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:23,118
insect pathogen and then in actual cell

158
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:26,039
wall we have cellulose hemicellulose

159
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:28,800
pectin versus protein and chitin in an

160
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,668
insect cuticle and then once inside a

161
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,788
host we actually have some very similar

162
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:38,128
challenges being able to grow in a very

163
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:41,639
nutrient limited environment inside the

164
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:44,749
host being able to evade the immune

165
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,158
system of both a plant and an insect and

166
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:48,809
also being able to survive oxidative

167
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,879
stress which is a component of the

168
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:56,069
defense response of both plants and

169
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,899
insects so when we think about gene

170
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,209
families so this was really a file a

171
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,459
genomic approach and this was in

172
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,110
collaboration with some a group in China

173
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,528
actually at the Chinese Academy of

174
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,629
Science and Joey Spadafora and we're

175
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:12,028
looking at the evolution of several gene

176
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,979
families involved integrating some of

177
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:16,978
these compounds across the hypo creel

178
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:19,860
ease and we think about carbon degrading

179
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:23,128
enzymes we think about chasms or

180
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,319
carbohydrate active enzymes and we have

181
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:28,229
glycosyl hydrolases which include most

182
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,139
of the cellulases and other other

183
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:33,750
enzymes of degrading cellulose by costal

184
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,060
transferases polysaccharide lyases so

185
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,908
these and particularly talking about

186
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,388
pectin degradation which is the glue

187
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:44,519
that holds together plant cells and then

188
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,610
carbohydrate s trace and carbohydrate

189
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:51,568
binding modules in terms of oxidative

190
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,669
enzymes we have p4 cytochrome p450s and

191
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:56,308
protease is actually play a very

192
00:08:53,669 --> 00:09:00,949
important role in insect pathogenesis in

193
00:08:56,308 --> 00:09:03,778
degrading the outer cuticle of the

194
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:07,170
so when we look at the evolution of

195
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:09,059
chasm families across this is the order

196
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:12,000
hypo creole ease again starting right

197
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:14,129
here at this point and then we have at

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,919
this point here we have a shift to

199
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:20,100
either insect in red parasitism or

200
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,778
fungal in in blue and so we've been

201
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,149
looking at how do the enzymes that

202
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:26,820
degrade the components of points of all

203
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,980
versus the components of insect cuticle

204
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,160
and fungal cell walls how does how does

205
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:36,120
that change within a genome and we do

206
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,669
see a decrease among a shift here in a

207
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,028
general decrease in overall numbers of

208
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:47,729
chasms in both the fungal and the insect

209
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:50,370
pathogens and when we look specifically

210
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,089
at you know breaking down these families

211
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,950
of chasms in particular we have a very

212
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,860
so here again we see a decrease in

213
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,390
really all families particularly like ah

214
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,009
so hydrous hydrolases

215
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:06,539
and fobbed in cellulose degradation and

216
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:08,399
poli-sci polysaccharide lyases in

217
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,049
particular I mean we talk about those

218
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,350
that degrade pectin but you can see here

219
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:14,849
the animal matter is iam tulip radium

220
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,670
and cordyceps really only have three

221
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:22,440
whereas most of our plant pathogens have

222
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:24,179
numbers in the 20s to 30s and this is

223
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,210
just to show you in terms of pectin

224
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:30,059
catabolism when we look at the actual

225
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:33,120
pathway from degrading pectin to pecked

226
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:36,299
a 2d Gallic Turin ate these are the

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,839
enzyme commission codes involved and

228
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:42,389
when we map that across this group in

229
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,150
terms of their ecology so plant plant

230
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,069
associate in green fungal in blue and

231
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,919
red insect pathogens you can see there

232
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,440
is in fact a significant contraction of

233
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:57,539
these of this enzyme family at this

234
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:01,770
transition to insect pathogenesis these

235
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:04,139
fungi no longer need these enzymes in

236
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,539
terms of oxidative enzymes the

237
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,129
cytochrome p450s I'm sure most of you

238
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,240
are familiar with them but I thought I'd

239
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:13,100
just briefly describe them there

240
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,100
oxidative enzymes that use a heme

241
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,800
cofactor and they're involved in

242
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,009
oxidation of various organic substrates

243
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,289
so lipids steroids xenobiotics or

244
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,600
foreign compounds and they interestingly

245
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:29,059
are also involved in the synthesis of

246
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,790
secondary metabolites and they're

247
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:35,569
generally classified based on sequence

248
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:38,179
similarity in two families based on 40%

249
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,750
amino acid similarity and Sutton so this

250
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:44,778
would be the family sip 561 and

251
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,059
subfamilies based on 55% amino acid

252
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:49,039
identity so subfamily c and then an

253
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:55,579
individual class or gene would be given

254
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:59,480
a number across the we look at oxidative

255
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:02,060
enzymes across this group we also see an

256
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,539
increase in the plant pathogenic group

257
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:07,759
and a decrease in Toula palladium and

258
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:10,099
cordyceps in the insect pathogens in

259
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:14,958
particular and i didn't mention this

260
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:17,990
this is actually a cafe analysis so

261
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:21,229
we've we've looked at the extent numbers

262
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,990
in current species and then using

263
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,810
maximum likelihood inferred ancestral

264
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,990
numbers at each of these nodes and then

265
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:34,149
inferred increases at particular nodes

266
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,149
or decreases at particular nodes

267
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,629
proteases we also see a similar pattern

268
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,660
I guess I I didn't actually point out

269
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:46,429
here that in the meta regime group we do

270
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:48,439
actually see an increase in oxidative

271
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:51,049
enzymes and remember that I said

272
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,750
mannerism is actually one of these fungi

273
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:55,789
that has a dual ecology in terms of

274
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,679
being able to colonize both the res fear

275
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:00,439
and the roots and also being a good

276
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:03,169
insect pathogen so interestingly they

277
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,940
have retained some of these enzymes that

278
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:10,729
may be important for plant colonization

279
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,709
in terms of proteases we also see a

280
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,980
similar pattern increasing in plant

281
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:18,439
associated and also in the meta rhythm

282
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,110
clade and then a decrease a decrease

283
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,450
both in the fungal parasites and also in

284
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:29,330
the insect parasites or pathogens

285
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:33,290
so in conclusion from this part of the

286
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,509
talk when we look at widely across the

287
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:39,049
order and across fungi with different

288
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:41,000
Ecology's we do see a expansions in

289
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,399
plant or I guess they could be either

290
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,339
expansions in the plant associated fungi

291
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:50,330
or contractions particularly in the

292
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:53,180
insect associated fungi and particularly

293
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,730
those genes involved in cellulose and

294
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:58,099
pectin degradation insect pathogens have

295
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,839
pretty much lost the function of

296
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:04,430
degrading cellulose and pectin people

297
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,589
are 50s in proteases so a similar

298
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:09,588
expansion in the plan associated fungi

299
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:13,310
and and in those fungi that have a dual

300
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,800
ecology they are able they also show a

301
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:17,958
similar or more broad profile of both of

302
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:26,389
these classes of enzymes than the true

303
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:27,739
and strict insect pathogens okay so so

304
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,569
now I'm gonna move on to talk a little

305
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,049
bit about my work until a palladium

306
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:37,220
inflate them this is a mouthful to light

307
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:39,409
palladium it's Latham and this is it's a

308
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,560
widespread soil fungus in fact it was

309
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:44,629
thought to be asexual until Cathy Hodge

310
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,799
from this department this is a

311
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:50,360
photograph from the plant path herbarium

312
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:51,919
discovered the sexual stage of to lipo

313
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,320
Collegium so we thought we thought it

314
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,099
was an anamorphic fungus living in soil

315
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,470
but in fact it infects beetles it was

316
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,329
first discovered on a scarab beetle here

317
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,009
in Ithaca New York interesting and

318
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:10,909
here's what's left of the beetle right

319
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:12,708
here sadly it's infected the beetle and

320
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,600
it's grown this is the stroma

321
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:18,139
of the fungus so it's formed a fruiting

322
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,170
body and up here it's forming sexual

323
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:22,850
spores and para theseare so and this is

324
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:25,759
this is actually what you're looking at

325
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,490
before in that picture with it coming

326
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,870
out of the root of the wood it's

327
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,570
actually growing through the wood and

328
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,528
then going out into the air just for you

329
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,420
late and spread its force it is also

330
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:40,549
well known or most known in

331
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:42,259
rest of the world and nobody knows what

332
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:43,669
to lipo clean him inflate them is but

333
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:48,620
how many of you have heard of the drug

334
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:50,120
cyclosporine only a few of you it's good

335
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,539
I guess none of you have had organ

336
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,490
transplants so that's a good thing so

337
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:58,039
it's it's not well known in the medical

338
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,389
world for being the producer of an

339
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,990
immunosuppressant drug called

340
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,539
cyclosporine a and cyclosporine a is the

341
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,060
product of a non-ribosomal peptide

342
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:11,629
synthesis gene which su Lee mentioned I

343
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:16,039
studied for my PhD and it's a it's an 11

344
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:20,389
modular gene that forms an 11 amino acid

345
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:23,419
or peptide ring cyclic structure and it

346
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,948
really was that the compound that was

347
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:27,439
responsible for development of

348
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:28,578
successful organ transplantation there's

349
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,500
actually at the University of Minnesota

350
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:32,388
Medical Center there's a there's a

351
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,039
little picture of topical adium on the

352
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:39,079
mural real a while I was riding up the

353
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:40,849
escalator one day and I saw that's it

354
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,729
has in fact made very important

355
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,320
contributions to medicine before that we

356
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,320
had a real issue with organ rejection

357
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,089
and and now most organ transplant

358
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,430
patients take cyclosporine it's also

359
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,199
used to treat a number of other

360
00:16:52,429 --> 00:17:00,409
autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid

361
00:16:54,198 --> 00:17:02,328
arthritis and psoriasis actually um so

362
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:05,689
here's just a better diagram of the

363
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:08,359
lifecycle of t'lie palladium and like a

364
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:11,540
plant pathogen it has to infect its host

365
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,568
and interestingly does that also by

366
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,730
forming a form of a purse Oriya and kind

367
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:19,639
of trading through the insect cuticle so

368
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,140
here's a - hi feet penetrating inside

369
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,949
cuticles so this I'm going to call the

370
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,490
host infection stage once inside an

371
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,370
insect

372
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,339
many of these insect pathogenic fungi

373
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:33,199
undergo and also human pathogenic fungi

374
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:35,599
undergo a dimorphic switch so they

375
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,509
change from a Highfill stage to a yeast

376
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:42,349
stage in order to proliferate throughout

377
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:44,839
the insect Hema seal and so they

378
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:46,639
proliferate eventually causing death and

379
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,428
then sporulation

380
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,860
on the insect so here's this is a this

381
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,410
is a live weevil and on the

382
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:57,529
right here is a deadly bowl with till a

383
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,840
palladium sporulating and this is also a

384
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:04,910
mechanism to spread spores to new

385
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:07,548
insects if so we now know from the

386
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,730
genome that Philippa caladium inflate M

387
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:13,789
is a hetero phthalic fungus it has two

388
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,420
mating types and so only if we get two

389
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:20,269
mating types infecting the same insect

390
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:23,450
can we have mating and production of the

391
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:25,668
sexual state and sexual spores and it's

392
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,548
thought that both ascospores and the

393
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:30,110
comitia can infect an insect although

394
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:35,089
there hasn't been a lot of study on

395
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:37,339
which is more important in nature so so

396
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:40,279
one of the studies that I've done is an

397
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:42,230
RNA seek experiment to look at some of

398
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,500
the mechanisms of insect pathogenesis

399
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,839
and I started out I was afraid to work

400
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,779
inside an insect this was my first foray

401
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:54,139
into the insect world and so I decided

402
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:58,039
to grow the fungus in a media a minimal

403
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,710
media containing insect cuticle added so

404
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,539
it actually dissected some some weebles

405
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,600
the cuticle and treated that and put it

406
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:07,730
in the media and then isolated and

407
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,730
hemolymph and put that in the media and

408
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:14,058
then collected RNA and did RNA seek and

409
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,819
looking for responses to those two media

410
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:18,769
and I'm going to talk a little bit I'm

411
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:21,349
sure many of you are also familiar with

412
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,379
the go ontology where we're looking at

413
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:26,539
trying to classify genes I find it a

414
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,570
very useful way to classify functions of

415
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:31,428
genes and talk broadly about

416
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:33,740
transcriptional responses to particular

417
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:36,350
condition and so the top layer we have

418
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,289
again solely on the cellular location or

419
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,548
component of a gene or protein

420
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,500
biological process what general broad

421
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:44,929
process is involved with and molecular

422
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,359
function specific enzymatic functions

423
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:50,080
and these are again hierarchical so we

424
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,918
move from very general to very specific

425
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:57,980
and so when we do so this is when we do

426
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,929
a network look at overexpressed and up

427
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,630
the sir these are the up regulated genes

428
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:07,160
from the cuticle media

429
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:10,250
and these are mapped to the genome of

430
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,590
tilapia lady and protein genome and then

431
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,298
looking at we're looking at

432
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:17,418
over-represented gene over-represented

433
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:19,849
categories of go and so what we do find

434
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:22,070
is that Syrian peptidases and Syrian

435
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:24,139
hydrolases which have been pretty well

436
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:27,079
characterized as being involved in

437
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:31,220
penetrating or digesting the cuticle

438
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,319
were one class that's up regulated then

439
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,110
we have genes in oxido reductase

440
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,269
activity and siderophore iron transport

441
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:42,589
and so this is gonna become a theme for

442
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:45,970
today's talk I decided to look

443
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:49,250
particularly at cytochrome p450s and

444
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:54,798
interestingly there are a number from

445
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:57,589
this six five five family and set 505

446
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:01,639
family and these have been actually

447
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:03,859
studied in Bavaria ba Siana and shown to

448
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,770
degrade out paints and also an alkane

449
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:09,019
assimilation and this is a fatty acid

450
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:13,579
hydroxylase and this one is involved in

451
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:14,929
degradation of oleic acid and in there

452
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:18,139
was a really nice paper that came out in

453
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:21,980
Bavaria that showed that several members

454
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,409
of this class of cytochrome p450s do you

455
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,720
actually can actually degrade some of

456
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:29,000
the particular hydrocarbons so the

457
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,669
hydrocarbon compounds found in insect

458
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,159
cuticle and so that's very likely their

459
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:42,860
role and and Families 655 and 505 when

460
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,630
we look at the genes upregulated in

461
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:48,079
hemolymph

462
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:51,980
we again see importance of iron binding

463
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,139
and oxido reductase activity and then a

464
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,019
large category of genes involved in

465
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,970
sugar and carbohydrate transmembrane

466
00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:00,470
transport which I still don't really

467
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,730
understand what they're involved in but

468
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,669
we're we're looking into that and in

469
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,319
terms of the cytochrome p450 family

470
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:14,179
there are a couple interesting genes

471
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,058
this this one right here these both of

472
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,769
these from

473
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:20,460
current families and actually from the

474
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:22,710
same family 504 are involved in ortho

475
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,889
hydroxylation of phenyl acetate and

476
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,139
phenyl acetate is one one compound that

477
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:30,959
is produced by the insect immune

478
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:33,778
response and so these two genes could be

479
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,190
involved in detox inside inside of an

480
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:40,048
insect so that's another potential

481
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:42,360
function of the cytochrome p450s so

482
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:45,388
that's sort of more primary different

483
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:48,209
changes in primary metabolism and ways

484
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:50,038
to utilize an insect versus a plant host

485
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,028
and now i'm going to move on to my

486
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:53,368
favorite topic

487
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:55,769
fungal secondary metabolites genes and

488
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:57,749
I'm sure you've heard from Gillian a

489
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,460
little bit about categories of secondary

490
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:02,038
metabolites genes but there are

491
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,399
non-ribosomal peptide synthesis or NRP

492
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:09,509
s's poly key tights and faces or PKS

493
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:12,028
a--'s terpene synthases which produced

494
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:14,399
her pains and isoprenoids and dimethyl

495
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:17,249
al l-tryptophan synthesis which are

496
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:19,378
involved in the first synthesis step of

497
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:23,249
many alkaloids or got alkaloid and

498
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:25,888
alkaloid compounds and you've also

499
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:29,069
probably heard that n RP SS are modular

500
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:31,729
both and RPS SNP cases are modular in

501
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:34,769
the sense that they're comprised of

502
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:39,240
protein domains that string together

503
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:42,089
amino acids non-ribosomal e and link

504
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,849
them into a small peptide similarly in

505
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:46,888
poly key types and faces we have

506
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:51,719
linkages of carbon molecules usually

507
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:54,689
acetal or malonyl co a feather feature

508
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,069
of secondary metabolite gene clusters on

509
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,778
a fungi is that in most one jaya cluster

510
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:02,519
many of the genes involved in production

511
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:05,308
of a particular metabolite into a

512
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,649
secondary metabolite cluster and this is

513
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:10,558
a cluster for cyclosporine synthetase

514
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:12,928
from to let palladium and you can see

515
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,079
that it actually contains both an N R PS

516
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:18,379
and a PKS gene as well as a large number

517
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,230
of other kinds of accessory proteins

518
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:25,378
that may be involved in transport

519
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:28,190
modification oxidation or set elation of

520
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:28,189
the final product

521
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,210
um we do know a fair amount about I just

522
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,759
wanted to briefly talk about some of the

523
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:38,340
secondary metabolites that we have we

524
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,640
know about from the hypo Creoles um

525
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:44,159
few Manas ins from Fusarium and niacin

526
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,630
are both well few mana since in

527
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,110
particular important for plant

528
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,390
pathogenesis peptide balls are an

529
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:55,139
interesting group from the Trichoderma

530
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:58,250
that these are large and RPS produced

531
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,049
compounds that form pores in membranes

532
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:04,440
and then you have a lot of compounds

533
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:06,839
that have shown some effect in terms of

534
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,210
being involved in insect pathogenesis so

535
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,970
the very soon basi on allied from

536
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,819
Bavaria species they've been knocked out

537
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,519
and shown to have a roll in and they're

538
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:20,939
not pathogenicity factors but they have

539
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,160
a role in insect pathogenesis and then

540
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,700
the ergot alkaloids in para mean from a

541
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,759
Chloe species are really thought to be

542
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,610
anti feeding compounds they interfere or

543
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,589
they deter or bits one of their

544
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:36,168
functions but we also know that the

545
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:40,829
ergot alkaloids obviously have

546
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:44,340
neurological effects but I'm sure you've

547
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:46,168
heard about some of those and then

548
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,939
finally down here we have destructions

549
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,970
from meta resume and cyclosporine sperm

550
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,210
to lipo caladium which have effects on

551
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:58,319
the insect immune response their immune

552
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:01,079
suppressants generally and this has been

553
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,529
well shown for cyclosporine in insects

554
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,480
so this is controlled and this is a

555
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:11,099
cyclosporine treated you can see that

556
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,079
this is production I believe proactive

557
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:15,269
it might be anti bacterial peptides or

558
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,699
lysosomes so there's a really strong

559
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:20,400
effect of cyclosporine on the insect

560
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,440
immune response and based on that we now

561
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,230
know that cyclosporine also interferes

562
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,390
with the human immune response binding

563
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,798
to interfering with calcineurin

564
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,940
activating nuclear factors and the

565
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:38,308
initiation of transcription of

566
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:40,558
interleukin 2 so when I looked at the

567
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:41,700
expression of sight the cyclosporine

568
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,160
cluster

569
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,559
in both of these different kinds of

570
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,440
media so the cuticle media and the

571
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,240
hemolymph media it was expressed in both

572
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,330
and this was also very useful in

573
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,370
defining what genes were actually within

574
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:59,339
the cluster and involved in biosynthesis

575
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:01,649
so these are these are all these two are

576
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,659
computational prediction programs for

577
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,269
defining a secondary metabolite cluster

578
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,860
and we actually did RNA sync we found

579
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:09,839
that it was actually a combination of

580
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,389
those two we found the intersection that

581
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,179
is very likely the set of genes involved

582
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,610
in production but it does actually look

583
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,970
like cyclosporine is more highly up

584
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:24,509
regulated in the hemolymph media which

585
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,819
makes sense it's probably active once

586
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,230
the fungus has penetrated and it's in

587
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:30,450
the Hema so it's trying to kill an

588
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:35,430
insect suppress suppress the immune

589
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:37,019
system um if I would add in I told you

590
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,720
Lee and I was gonna add in a slide about

591
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,730
iron metabolism and iron secondary

592
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,819
metabolites and actually this is

593
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,740
something I worked on for my PhD Gillian

594
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:49,259
and Gillian had determined that there

595
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,049
were really two different pathways of

596
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:56,460
production of sedara fungal siderophores

597
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:58,669
one leads to intracellular crime type

598
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,000
siderophores the other to extracellular

599
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,759
Sedaris a

600
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,799
and RPS called n RPS six in cochlea

601
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:12,170
bolus and for my PhD I actually wrote a

602
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:14,460
paper on the the fact that there are

603
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,800
paralogs of these genes in many in

604
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,900
several fungi there's a there's a there

605
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,970
was a gene duplication event and some

606
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,980
fungi including till I poked ledian

607
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,289
actually have two copies so they have a

608
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,610
copy from this group that is homologous

609
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:31,409
to the cochlea dualists and PS six ed

610
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:35,639
which form compounds known as copper

611
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:39,300
genes and also have a copy homologous to

612
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,300
a gene in a human pathogen Aspergillus

613
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:44,700
fumigatus and this is known as sodi and

614
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,039
it produced and also in feed areum which

615
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,910
it produces a tri-c diffuser and seek

616
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,769
type compound so we're interested in why

617
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,170
doesn't a lipo caladium have to and we

618
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:57,119
still don't fully know the answer but

619
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:00,660
when we look at its patterns of

620
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,729
expression we do find that the Cobra Jen

621
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:07,890
type is more highly expressed in a

622
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,930
cuticle media whereas the Aspergillus

623
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,259
homolog is more highly expressed in a

624
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:15,900
hemolymph media and it has been shown

625
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:18,930
that the Aspergillus homolog is involved

626
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,720
in human pathogenesis so it makes sense

627
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,880
that that the tell a palladium homolog

628
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:29,339
may have may also have a function in

629
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,650
insect pathogenesis okay so so this work

630
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:34,589
really identified some particular gene

631
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,570
families that we are investigating to

632
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:39,240
look at their roles and insect

633
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,579
pathogenesis so oxidated particularly

634
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,400
oxidative enzymes and those involved in

635
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:47,519
response to oxidative stress serine

636
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,400
proteases involved in penetrating the

637
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,799
insect cuticle and then iron scavenging

638
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,720
and binding molecules which clearly have

639
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,169
been shown to have roles in both plant

640
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,860
and animal pathogenesis clearly also had

641
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,830
roles in insect pathogenesis and in

642
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:05,519
terms of secondary metabolites

643
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:07,409
cyclosporine is the one that I'm

644
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,930
continuing to work on and really trying

645
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,850
to nail down we're doing some gene

646
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,950
knockouts and tagging at the moment I

647
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:15,990
don't have any results to report from

648
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,940
that yet but we're really interested in

649
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,410
what is it doing inside of an insect and

650
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,630
what is its target because we actually

651
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,920
although we know the target in humans we

652
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:28,170
don't actually know the target in

653
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:30,150
insects funny how that works and then

654
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:39,660
siderophores iron scavenging is clearly

655
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:41,400
important okay so now I'm going to tell

656
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,110
you a little bit about a project that

657
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,990
we're working on in Bavaria bossy onna

658
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:48,029
and this was actually really initiated

659
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,069
by a high school student that came to me

660
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:52,619
one day and said I'd like to do a

661
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:54,389
science project in your lab or for a

662
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,879
something known as the Intel Science

663
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,420
Fair it's a nationwide competition for

664
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,150
high school students and I said oh okay

665
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:05,180
and he did an amazing amount of work he

666
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,480
was an incredible undergrad he actually

667
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,798
had completed a math degree at the

668
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,380
to Minnesota by the end of his high

669
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:16,548
school degree and is now in an MD MBA MD

670
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,179
program at the University of Minnesota

671
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:21,798
so he was a special high school student

672
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:24,230
and you did a lot of transcriptomic work

673
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,369
and then two postdocs I have also worked

674
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,589
on it

675
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:30,519
John minke was my first postdoc he did a

676
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:33,589
lot of genomics work and Radhika Bajaj

677
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,029
did a lot of insect infection assays and

678
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,789
some followed up on some of the

679
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:41,990
transcript omics so I better introduce

680
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:46,009
Bob area area as I mentioned is best

681
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:49,669
known as as an insect pathogen it is

682
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:52,759
actually one one strain is a component

683
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:54,410
of a bio control product known as this

684
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:56,210
is my control oh actually I think there

685
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,900
are two bio control products out on the

686
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:02,779
market and here is an insect spray it

687
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:07,130
can be sprayed on foliage and will kill

688
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:09,168
insect pests effective but recently it's

689
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,870
also been discovered as a systemic end

690
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:14,360
of fight and it grows both in the roots

691
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:18,829
so this is a gfp strain and they showed

692
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:20,659
that it this is um roots and met iridium

693
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:22,609
and bavaria both grow in the roots where

694
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:27,380
sub area is also growing in the leaves

695
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:30,109
but matter is iam is not Bavaria is also

696
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,780
a huge very bossy Jana in particular is

697
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:36,019
a huge species complex and we still know

698
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:38,779
very little about the phylogenetic or

699
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:40,990
the population structure or potentially

700
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:45,558
phylogenetic structure of this group and

701
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:47,960
they're distributed worldwide and you

702
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:49,460
know many of the we also invited over a

703
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,610
little about differences in virulence

704
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,069
and how do we go about selecting a good

705
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:57,589
bio control stream and so this is

706
00:32:55,069 --> 00:33:00,379
actually a collaboration with dr. Steve

707
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:02,298
Rayner at the USDA in Beltsville he has

708
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,669
a enormous collection of the various

709
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:05,690
strains and been working a little bit

710
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:08,690
with him on that

711
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:13,160
and initially we've just started

712
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:16,759
sequencing about 10 genomes and this was

713
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,620
done using Illumina technology and we

714
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,250
did three out-group taxa but very

715
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,798
bassiano

716
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:24,200
broken RTI Australis and

717
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,210
see Attica I guess four and then eight

718
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,298
different strains of Bavaria ba Siena

719
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,548
and it's a fairly small genome with very

720
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:34,579
low repeat content so these were fairly

721
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:38,839
easy to assemble to a good quality draft

722
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:42,220
genome and have very little very low

723
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,808
repeat content they're nice fungus and

724
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,548
specifically when we look at interest

725
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:49,249
but one of our interest is to look at

726
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:51,980
interest specific diversity of secondary

727
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:54,499
metabolite genes and when we look across

728
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,389
so these are the different categories of

729
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,788
secondary metabolite genes on the top

730
00:33:56,388 --> 00:34:00,918
here and these are all the different

731
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:03,378
strains and there is variation and

732
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,690
really a lot of them in particular the

733
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:08,719
polyketide synthase genes show high

734
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:13,818
variation as well as terpene synthase

735
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:16,398
genes however when we look at the genes

736
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:19,190
that we know have some function in

737
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,409
insect pathogenesis we don't see much

738
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,480
variation we just embarrassing for

739
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:26,059
example is present in all all of the

740
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,099
bavaria bossy honest strains bossy

741
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:31,519
analyte is present in all but one and

742
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:34,129
tunnel in which is a an RPS PKS hybrid

743
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,480
produced compound is also present in all

744
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:37,250
that one so there's not a lot of

745
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,780
divergence in terms of the entropy s

746
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,079
genes that we know are involved in

747
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,540
insect pathogenesis but we when we look

748
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,298
at both poly key types and faces and

749
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:50,298
terpenes and phases we do see a lot more

750
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:52,849
interest specific variation and this is

751
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:55,179
just a comparison of six strains and on

752
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:59,030
the bottom here is the number of strains

753
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,710
that share so two strains share six

754
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,740
genes there's actually about 25

755
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,510
different PKS genes and only four of

756
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:07,489
them are shared across all these strains

757
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:11,049
and so there's really a lot of

758
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:14,568
specialization and strain specific

759
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:16,429
secondary metabolite genes the same is

760
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:19,338
true of terpenes although there are less

761
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:21,318
there's only four or five terpene

762
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:24,440
synthase genes and these fungi but but

763
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:26,420
there's also variable numbers and we

764
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,690
found an interesting terpene cluster

765
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:33,409
that we're now following up on where we

766
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,460
actually see a complete duplication or

767
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:37,318
loss of the entire gene cluster

768
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:41,849
so this is a large gene cluster probably

769
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:45,150
about 45 kilobases and it is absent in

770
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:47,400
the ancestral out-group species so it

771
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,380
appears to have originated at the origin

772
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,030
in the Bavaria bassiano species complex

773
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:58,440
and it's been lost in one stream and

774
00:35:53,030 --> 00:36:01,019
duplicated in another strain and when we

775
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,329
look at very lens we've also done some

776
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:07,759
virulence assays Bavaria on an insect so

777
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:10,349
we're using we're actually using

778
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,309
lepidopteran the fall army worm our

779
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:16,170
spinatra fruit papaya and we're using

780
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:19,050
injections we want to make sure

781
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,970
interestingly Bavaria did not colonize

782
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:23,818
the cuticle very well this particular

783
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:25,558
insect which was interesting to me so we

784
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:28,409
decided to go with an injection it's

785
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,000
also a much more exact approach to

786
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:33,509
inject a certain amount of spores into

787
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,440
an insect and then we also grow control

788
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:41,339
in a liquid media minimal liquid and

789
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,480
also PDB and then at 24 and 48 hours

790
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:45,269
harvested

791
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,338
actually the whole insects and the

792
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:51,000
tissue from the fungus to do RNA seek

793
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:55,980
and also look at the time to death and

794
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,280
just for you layin and ld50 and when we

795
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,440
look at a survival curve we had a few

796
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,510
this our control we had a few losses and

797
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,960
then we had this one in the middle which

798
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:11,490
actually corresponds I believe 2 3 4 0

799
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,960
but there's really two two groups we

800
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,159
have the control and there's a couple in

801
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,720
the middle and then very strongly

802
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:21,239
virulent but but when we look at we

803
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,298
compare those two streams 3 4 0 where we

804
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,858
have a complete loss of the cluster and

805
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:28,500
318 where we have a duplication of the

806
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:34,469
cluster we do see a really strong effect

807
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:37,889
on virulence at day 7 in 3 4 0 90% of

808
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:41,789
those insects are dead in 3 18 only 8 or

809
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:43,409
I'm sorry 90% are alive and in 3 18 only

810
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:45,900
18 percent of our lives so it's a much

811
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:48,699
quicker time to death which is a which

812
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,190
is a measure of virulence

813
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,989
and so we're now kind of following up on

814
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,088
this we're doing some gene knockouts at

815
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:58,568
the moment to really try to characterize

816
00:37:55,088 --> 00:38:03,969
does this have a specific role in insect

817
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:07,869
pathogenesis and what what is that again

818
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:10,449
when we look at expression and this is a

819
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,880
we didn't actually see much much change

820
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:15,629
at 24 hours but when we look at 48 hours

821
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,829
after injection and we both see

822
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:21,099
initiation of an insect immune response

823
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:24,579
and we also see turning on a fungal

824
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:28,119
genes and again we have genes involved

825
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:29,769
in oxidation oxidative activity in this

826
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,890
case we also have genes involved in

827
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:35,380
fatty acid biosynthesis which which is

828
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:37,539
interesting fatty acids are becoming

829
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:41,380
shown to be important in various

830
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:44,588
signaling processes and that's so this

831
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:47,440
is general biological processes and then

832
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:50,349
in terms of molecular function again we

833
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,139
have oxido reductase activities metal

834
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:55,390
binding in particular iron comes out of

835
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:57,009
that as well so so these two categories

836
00:38:55,389 --> 00:39:01,480
are clearly important in insect

837
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:03,579
pathogenesis and then we also have holo

838
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,338
acyl carrier protein synthesis activity

839
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:08,410
and if you know many of the secondary

840
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:12,400
metabolites actually use an acyl carrier

841
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:17,230
protein mode of action to attach amino

842
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,240
acids to the N RPS protein we've also

843
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,750
found some interesting candidate

844
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:26,669
secondary metabolites there's a PKS that

845
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:30,190
appears to be homologous to lovastatin

846
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:33,608
biosynthesis cluster and in RPS gene a

847
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:36,700
fatty acid synthase gene and also three

848
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:41,699
acyl adenylate ensigns which are really

849
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:41,699
just the one domain of an n RP s protein

850
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:47,199
so in conclusion it's clear that

851
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:49,900
variation in the secondary metabolite n

852
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,118
chalene for confer important differences

853
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:55,838
in phenotype particularly virulence

854
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,460
in an insect and we're really working

855
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,608
right now in doing some of the genetics

856
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,570
so we believe now how the gene knockout

857
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:04,239
of the

858
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:06,010
synthase and also some chemistry to

859
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,529
really nail down what what is this thing

860
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:14,410
producing and what might be its effect

861
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:16,240
on the insect immune system okay a few

862
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:20,319
more one for a few more slides this is

863
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,739
this is a tail the tail of my story so I

864
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,620
also have a project working on nematode

865
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,759
pathogens and parasites and a big a

866
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,519
large part of that is actually

867
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,280
collecting we've been collecting a large

868
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:35,650
number of fungi from agricultural fields

869
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,260
so a soybean corn rotation in Minnesota

870
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:42,610
which is pretty much all you see in

871
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:45,580
Minnesota soybean or corn field so we

872
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:47,380
collected them from this is actually the

873
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,569
soybean cyst nematode so we've collected

874
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:53,140
them from eggs the soybean cyst nematode

875
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:55,360
from soil from soybean roots and various

876
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:57,480
environments and then the final it's

877
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,460
part of this project just to look at

878
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,289
mechanisms of virulence and also toxins

879
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,590
that might be produced by some of these

880
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:08,170
fungi and this was worked by a master

881
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:11,260
student um and he's still actually

882
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,750
working on this and he was interested in

883
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,970
comparing several different nematode

884
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:19,420
parasites so one that's a trapping

885
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:21,639
fungus are about religious flora an egg

886
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:25,539
parasite metaphor cordyceps clone is

887
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:29,409
phoria and a j2 parasite so this is a j2

888
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:31,619
is a worm stage of the nematode it's

889
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:34,679
actually the infective stage of a root

890
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:38,889
and this is her sutala minnesotan cysts

891
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:40,839
isolated from minnesota and so here's

892
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:42,159
interested in and looking at what are

893
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,019
their similarities or differences

894
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,239
between the way that these different

895
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:50,710
nematode parasites interact with a

896
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:53,559
nematode and he did clustering on the

897
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:56,590
genome level so there's no ala Guster's

898
00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:00,519
gene families across the three pathogens

899
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:02,769
and found that there's more similarities

900
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:05,530
between meta cordyceps and each of these

901
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:08,409
other fungi so lots of shared genes then

902
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:10,830
between the JT parasite and the trapping

903
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,829
fungus

904
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:18,250
and then he also did an RNA seek

905
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:20,170
experiment where he grew up the fungus

906
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,289
and we decided to use liquid culture

907
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:26,289
just to get enough tissue to do RNA

908
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:29,529
analysis but we added either so for the

909
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:32,769
j2 or worm parasites we added a co

910
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:34,720
culture of sterilized worms and for the

911
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:37,358
egg parasite we added sterilized eggs

912
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:42,309
and then collected RNA samples at day

913
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:44,590
one three and seven and again when we

914
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:48,759
look at so this is an early interaction

915
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,130
at 24 hours and we're excited to see

916
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,109
something related to chemical stimuli

917
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,700
when at one of the things that were

918
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:57,489
interested in in these nematode

919
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,899
parasites is you know are their signals

920
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:00,789
that we are their chemical signals

921
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,380
either from the plant or from the fungus

922
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:06,579
or from other nematodes that we could

923
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:08,559
utilize for bio control and so we're

924
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:13,090
looking into some of the genes in this

925
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:15,039
category and also this category of

926
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,869
response to miss folded proteins or some

927
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:20,679
heat shock proteins which we are not

928
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:22,780
clear what those are those are doing and

929
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:25,899
again when we look at molecular function

930
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,450
we also see oxido reductase activity and

931
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:31,119
iron binding and also carbohydrate

932
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:32,858
kinase activity which I also have no

933
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,720
idea what that is involved in at the

934
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:40,259
moment and so when he compared so this

935
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:43,899
is looking again at the early response

936
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,190
when he compared up regulated genes and

937
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,369
looked at ornithologist clusters of

938
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,200
those again there are more similarities

939
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:52,990
between meta cordyceps in each of these

940
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:55,210
other fungi than between the two and he

941
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:57,819
also identified a group of what we call

942
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:01,690
core ornithologist clusters that might

943
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:04,990
have a shared common common role in

944
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,700
nematode pathogenesis and some of those

945
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:08,889
categories are in fact heat shock

946
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:12,399
proteins these ones we we don't know

947
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:15,129
what they are so we're goes and then so

948
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,070
another category that has some secondary

949
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:20,200
metabolite genes in it there's actually

950
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,740
an interesting PKS gene in this cluster

951
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:24,989
24 that may have a role in in nematode

952
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:29,949
pathogenesis

953
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:32,139
um so in in conclusion um it's clear

954
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:35,049
that there are some shared mechanisms of

955
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:37,150
pathogenesis across different nematode

956
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,769
parasites and even insect Capuchin so

957
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,220
these are actually very closely related

958
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:44,440
fungi and it may not be that much of a

959
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:46,869
shift to move from an insect to a

960
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,780
nematode ecology

961
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:50,859
there are many shared and enzyme

962
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,920
families that are involved in

963
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,720
pathogenesis and we've also identified

964
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,369
some interesting secondary metabolites

965
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:59,469
candidate genes that we're now working

966
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:04,299
on some genetic approaches to fully

967
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:08,519
characterize their functions and so with

968
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:12,430
that I will thank some people people and

969
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,840
most of our genomics work has been done

970
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:16,949
at both the Mayo Clinic and the

971
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,150
Minnesota biochemical biogenetic and

972
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:21,579
topical ADM was actually sequenced at

973
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,889
Duke University with funding from an

974
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:27,400
interesting source a mushroom production

975
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:30,069
company in Korea interested in trying to

976
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,550
understand how these fungi fruit in

977
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:35,800
fruiting genes the mating type genes

978
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,030
most of the tilapia caladium genome and

979
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,160
transcriptome is done in collaboration

980
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:42,400
with Joey status for his lab at Oregon

981
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:44,109
State and the bavaria project i'm been

982
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,950
working with steve rainer at the usda

983
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:52,090
and then these postdocs and outstanding

984
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:53,589
high school students and funding that's

985
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,110
mostly funded right now through the

986
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:59,050
university of minnesota and then this

987
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:01,480
comparative work on the Geno genomics

988
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:05,110
and toxin production of nematode

989
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,639
parasites is sort of synergistic with

990
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:10,450
the project that we have with from the

991
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,190
USDA identifying name is herd parasites

992
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:15,609
and pathogens for potential bio control

993
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,809
or bio pesticide use and also a little

994
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,180
bit of funding from the Minnesota

995
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:20,349
soybean growers if you're in Minnesota

996
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:23,409
it's good to get funding from the

997
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:25,059
Minnesota soybean and so with that I

998
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:27,159
mean thank you and happy to take any

999
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:32,438
questions

1000
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:32,438
[Applause]

1001
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:58,429
good question we're still looking at

1002
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:59,899
that question we're now moving on so

1003
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:02,298
we've done the insect pathogenicity

1004
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,880
essays we're actually going to do some

1005
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:07,009
plant pathogen escy assays and assess

1006
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,410
that and then we are going to address

1007
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:10,969
that question I think and there's

1008
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:14,358
actually a another graduate student

1009
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:16,608
she's actually co-advised who's doing an

1010
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:19,038
experimental evolution project so she's

1011
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:20,538
looking at if I passage it through an

1012
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,249
insect multiple times how does the

1013
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:24,140
genome change if I passage it through a

1014
00:47:22,248 --> 00:47:25,759
plant multiple times how does the genome

1015
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:49,088
change so that that will actually be

1016
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:54,710
very interesting I think questions very

1017
00:47:49,088 --> 00:47:57,380
interested so what's the plan I'm doing

1018
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:02,599
all this kind of genome work is that for

1019
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:05,900
both reasons for you know the

1020
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:11,180
bioindustry because I'm very curious of

1021
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:12,920
what the infected insect fungus is doing

1022
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:17,048
because a lot of people are interested

1023
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:21,588
in that for all host of like you know

1024
00:48:17,048 --> 00:48:28,219
energy powering or viagra or because I

1025
00:48:21,588 --> 00:48:30,920
was at a professor that was working in

1026
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:33,259
Nepal on roads and he said that there's

1027
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,170
a lot of people collecting worms in

1028
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:39,259
Nepal and selling them to China and for

1029
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,809
the that infected the way you're saying

1030
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:44,210
used for Viagra reasons

1031
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:46,789
and probably for other reasons so I was

1032
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:48,320
just curious yeah I mean I think I think

1033
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:51,079
there are a lot of potential

1034
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,180
applications to this work I mean my my

1035
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,039
work with the Minnesota soybean growers

1036
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:57,739
is really an agricultural application

1037
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,900
can we find biopesticides can we find an

1038
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:02,209
organism that we could use for bio

1039
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,920
control um but I've actually been a

1040
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,139
mission I was in China for a year so I

1041
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,250
actually studied this fungus that grows

1042
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:13,400
in Nepal in China and that that is

1043
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:15,409
clearly a medicinal use and I think you

1044
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,869
know looking at - like palladium also um

1045
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:19,279
there's clearly medical things that we

1046
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:21,529
have not discovered from these fungi

1047
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,870
they're there and Stewart is working on

1048
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:26,330
this there you know there are compounds

1049
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:27,859
that we have no idea that exists and

1050
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:47,929
these fungi so I think it's the time

1051
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:52,789
it's an untapped resource I think they

1052
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:55,039
become more susceptible to infection I

1053
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,389
mean if you treat it with cyclosporine

1054
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,250
retreated pretreated

1055
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:59,750
yeah we haven't actually done that

1056
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:14,239
experiment like that that would be

1057
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:16,309
interesting to do I think thank you this
