1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,280
University

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:15,269
so last year I was I left off telling

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,039
you guys about our efforts to map large

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,800
effect early bite resistant slow sigh

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,419
and to tomato breeding programs and I

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,789
was telling you how we plan to use this

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,400
information to learn more about the

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,469
tomato early blight petha system and to

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,288
develop new inbreds with enhanced

11
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,390
disease resistance so i showed you that

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,340
we found four early by louis i of real

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,859
interest here two of which were

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,770
predictive predictive of stem lesion

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,890
resistance and that's EB 1.1 and eb 9

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,719
here colored in green and two were

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,808
predictive of resistance to defoliation

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:54,719
and those were EB 1.2 and EB 5 colored

19
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:56,789
in purple now of these four QTL e b5 and

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,308
eb 9 had statistically significant

21
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,140
resistance effects across five breeding

22
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:04,319
populations over the course of three

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,859
years while EB 1.2 was more

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,139
inconsistently detected now we've since

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,450
used this information to inform a

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,180
genome-wide marker-assisted backcross

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,299
scheme to rapidly pyramid these early by

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,600
KTL into two elite tomato backgrounds

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,350
from two separate market classes now the

30
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,719
first of these releases CU 1913 57 is a

31
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:30,359
northeast adapted medium-sized Fresh

32
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,420
Market slicing tomato and the other CU

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,299
2010 41 is a determinant Midwestern

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,490
processing type and these tomatoes which

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,860
carry additional resistances to a host

36
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,839
of other diseases are being thoroughly

37
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,429
evaluated this summer and are being

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,500
released to third-party breeding

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,130
programs through the Cornell vegetable

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,438
breeding Institute now alongside these

41
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,478
inbred releases we also wanted to

42
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,728
provide reliable and background

43
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,920
independent markers for these early

44
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,840
blight resistant slow sigh and the

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,329
traditional way to do this would be to

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,829
iteratively find map refining the

47
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:06,868
confidence intervals until it was

48
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:10,049
possible to identify and validate

49
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:12,110
confidence or candidate genes that would

50
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:15,120
become the target of molecular markers

51
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,220
but this kind of work is really time and

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,319
resource intensive especially when it

53
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,628
comes to quantitative disease resistance

54
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,199
and from a practical breeding

55
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:24,179
perspective

56
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,250
we don't really need to know the causal

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,159
variants and I would argue it's good

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,680
enough just to find the smallest extant

59
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,419
resistance bearing haplotype or the

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,790
smallest introgression from the

61
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,799
ancestral resistance source and then

62
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,289
from there you can design markers that

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,209
are specific to that haplotype and these

64
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,090
markers should be capable of predicting

65
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:48,090
resistance across breeding programs

66
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,769
regardless of the recent ancestry so my

67
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,469
project partner and I are attempting to

68
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,569
do exactly that by sequencing landmark

69
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,189
resistant inbreds from more than 80

70
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:58,738
years of early blight resistance

71
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:02,250
breeding and by applying the tools of

72
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,830
population genetics so to do this

73
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,719
successfully our first challenge was to

74
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,519
dig through the available breeding

75
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,280
records and to come up with a

76
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,310
hypothesized ancestral pathway for each

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,439
of our resistance QTL and i want to take

78
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,689
you now through one such history which

79
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,500
begins with a tomato reader by the name

80
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:24,719
of dr. George B Renard now dr. Renard

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,340
was an avid birdwatcher and in fact he

82
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,379
served on the board of the Cornell

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,239
ornithology lab where he helped them to

84
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,030
build out their recordings of the US and

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
Caribbean bird songs but in the 1930s

86
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,019
and 1940s dr. Renard worked at the

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,870
vegetable breeding laboratory in

88
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,209
Charleston South Carolina now there he

89
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,950
and CF and ruse works out the first

90
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,900
early bite inoculation protocols

91
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,828
allowing them to screen tomato

92
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,750
accessions for genetic resistance and he

93
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,930
and Andrews found resistance in several

94
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,060
Tomatoes but one an English forcing

95
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,480
tomato by the name of Devon surprise is

96
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,150
described in their 1944 publication as

97
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,429
having particularly strong resistance to

98
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,030
early bite stem lesions which is a face

99
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,680
of the disease also known as cholera now

100
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,840
importantly they also observed

101
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,048
inheritance ratios that suggested that

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,340
this resistance was was caused by a

103
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,529
single underlying locust now dr. Renard

104
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,500
eventually left the USDA to become a

105
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:27,299
tomato breeder for Campbell's and the

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,430
story might have ended there were it not

107
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,169
for another important and more

108
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,199
well-known early blight resistant tomato

109
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:37,049
called Campbell's 1943

110
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,000
now this tomato was described in a 1977

111
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,370
publication by Thomas Barksdale as

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,740
having excellent early blight Colorado

113
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,590
resistance and Barksdale also writes

114
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,410
that quote Campbell's 1943 was kindly

115
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:51,179
provided us by dr. George B Bernard of

116
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,060
the Campbell Institute for agricultural

117
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,100
research so this suggests that dr.

118
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,290
Renard having previously discovered

119
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,050
discovered the early bite resistance in

120
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,050
Devon surprised then use this tomato to

121
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,000
create Campbell's 1943 and from this

122
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,949
point forward recreating the pedigree is

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,019
much easier because dr. Randy Gardner

124
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,539
now emeritus professor at North Carolina

125
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,939
State University picked up Campbell's

126
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,140
1943 and used this as a source of

127
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,089
resistance for his 1980s release NCE BR

128
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,329
2 which had early bite stem lesion

129
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:27,899
resistance and then NCE BR 2 was used in

130
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:32,339
a subsequent 2008 release of NCC eld r1

131
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:34,049
and then NC CEO BR 1 was used by the

132
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,810
Cornell tomato breeding program as a

133
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,060
source of resistance for Cu 15 1095

134
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,899
which is in turn in the pedigree of our

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,449
two newest tomato releases and if we

136
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,129
repeat this process for other sources of

137
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,250
early blight resistance in the pedigree

138
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:52,500
I was able to put together this greatly

139
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,360
simplified hypothesized pedigree of

140
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,610
early blight resistance in our Tomatoes

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,850
that spans some 80 plus years of

142
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,949
breeding now the next step is to obtain

143
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,850
whole genome sequences for all of these

144
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:08,009
lines now some of these sequences were

145
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,260
available from the NCBI sequence read

146
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,810
archive or from our collaborators at The

147
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,219
Ohio State University and the remaining

148
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,410
nine Tomatoes though we sequenced

149
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,660
ourselves we built libraries using the

150
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,110
next arrow flex protocol and then ran

151
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,600
them on a next sequencer breeds were

152
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,550
then aligned to be Hinds 1706 reference

153
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,740
genome and this is the 4.0 reference

154
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,319
genome and snips were called with the

155
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,610
gatk for pipeline and this yielded about

156
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:38,339
12 X filtered coverage over the variants

157
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:41,550
so again if our hypothesized pedigree is

158
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:44,250
correct for the chromosome 9 QT l eb9

159
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,319
coming from Devon surprise then we

160
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,600
should be able to observe a shared hafla

161
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,730
type near a benign in Devon

162
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,580
surprise and in all of our landmark

163
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,770
early blight resistant inbreds now this

164
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,560
plot which is based on the output of the

165
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,969
a bababa test shows us that this is

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,339
indeed the case now

167
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,260
this analysis looks for the evidence of

168
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,319
introgression x' in triplet snip

169
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:10,050
contrast giving a D statistic that can

170
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,569
be used to paint chromosomes by ancestry

171
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,470
and also to visualize homologous hafla

172
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:18,659
types and what we find is that in all of

173
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,020
the early blight resistant entries they

174
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,450
share a solid red block of snips near

175
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,519
the ev9 locus and this suggests say

176
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:30,060
Devon's a shared Devon surprise

177
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,979
introgression in contrast snips that are

178
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,780
more consistent with a high in 1706

179
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,759
ancestry are colored in blue now another

180
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,889
way to find regions of high sequence

181
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,110
similarity is to window the genome and

182
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,360
then to use a clustering algorithm to

183
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,180
intelligently group the resulting alpha

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,480
types now here you can see an example

185
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,430
where I've projected 30 tomatoes from

186
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,129
four different clades into a two

187
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,480
dimensional PCA space for a single

188
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:02,490
genomic window near the eb9 KTL then I

189
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,710
used the k-means algorithm to cluster

190
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,100
the samples and found that it perfectly

191
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,539
separated the early blight resistant and

192
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,120
susceptible large rooted cultivars from

193
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,270
each other from two cherry tomato types

194
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,480
and from the wild species solanum fabric

195
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:20,339
IDs now this type of unsupervised

196
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,170
clustering analysis is really nice

197
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,629
because it's computationally pretty

198
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,910
trivial and because we can improve our

199
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,980
ability to distinguish among observable

200
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:33,240
haplotypes as we add additional

201
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,879
sequences to our database now once a

202
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,820
sample in a window is classified as a

203
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,070
member of a group we can then ask if

204
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,129
that sample is in the same or different

205
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,490
group from some putative ancestral line

206
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:49,019
of interest we can then color the areas

207
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,600
that have the same k-means clustering

208
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:55,289
nation to visualize homologous

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,639
haplotypes and even introgression now

210
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:01,500
here is one such plot of chromosome 9

211
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,549
inclusive of the 8 resistant samples

212
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,850
that I talked about early

213
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:09,839
they're blocked by this green resistant

214
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,940
bar at the top and then two random

215
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,879
susceptible samples from the pedigree I

216
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,340
described earlier at the bottom and the

217
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,919
genomic windows were colored if in any

218
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,850
window they were in the same cluster as

219
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,620
Devin surprise and the resistant

220
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,050
tomatoes are also sorted according to

221
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,330
their hypothesized ancestry with Devin

222
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:34,679
surprise the putative donor followed by

223
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:37,370
C 1943 and CBR to NCC gob r1 and then

224
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,689
our three most recent Cornell releases

225
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,490
and what's really cool about a plot like

226
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,920
this is you can actually watch the

227
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,899
haplotype from Devin's surprise decay

228
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,179
over time with phenotypic selection

229
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,059
going from a large introgression in

230
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,479
Campbell's 1943 to a relatively small

231
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,739
one into North Carolina tomatoes and

232
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,230
here on the right we've zoomed in to a

233
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,389
95% confidence interval for the eb9

234
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,399
locus the black ticks denote the

235
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:03,870
confidence interval boundaries and the

236
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,269
most predictive spin marker at the

237
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,580
center and we can clearly see that the

238
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,889
smallest contiguous Devin surprise

239
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,310
haplotype was present in the sample and

240
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:16,139
ccel be our 1a and this gives us a new

241
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:19,469
resistance haplotype size that's about

242
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:22,529
33% smaller than before or about 1.2

243
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,450
megabase pairs and furthermore these

244
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,519
data strongly suggest that our modern

245
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,250
early blight stem resistance traces back

246
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,559
directly to an early 20th century tomato

247
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,840
developed in Devon England which was

248
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,369
then improved by dr. Renard and through

249
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,000
significant public sector breeding

250
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,350
efforts spanning more than 40 years now

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,669
I don't really have time today to tell

252
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,500
you the whole story for the other

253
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:45,269
resistance Llosa here but I did want to

254
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,639
show you that we can do use the same

255
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,649
methods to trace our early blight 5

256
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,689
resistance locust to an unimproved

257
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,299
tamanna breeding lying named Hawaii 7 9

258
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,340
9 8 and in this case we were actually

259
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,189
able to shrink our interval size by more

260
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,050
than 60% over our prior boundaries so

261
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,270
this demonstrates the power of this

262
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:05,549
approach to reduce QTL confidence

263
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:08,610
intervals without ever having to do fine

264
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:11,219
mapping so now that we have some

265
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,840
preliminary success with this project we

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,120
want to scale this up to include wild

267
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,519
species and many more modern and

268
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
heirloom tomatoes

269
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,019
for which archived sequences already

270
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,088
exist and this should allow us to

271
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,188
further trace the history of our of our

272
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:27,259
resistance low sigh back to the wild

273
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:28,818
species donors and also to determine

274
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,680
whether there are other sequence

275
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:32,328
Tomatoes sitting in the gene bank that

276
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,198
share this early blight resistance

277
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:37,818
haplotype we aim to identify snips that

278
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:40,188
are specific to this resistance

279
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:41,870
haplotype to find excellent candidates

280
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:44,659
for portable and background independent

281
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,578
molecular markers and finally we hope

282
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:48,649
that this work will help to reveal

283
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:50,628
Tomatoes with unique versions of the

284
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,879
resistance haplotypes which could

285
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,039
predict the presence of novel alleles

286
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,039
conferring even stronger early blight

287
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,958
resistance and with that I'd like to

288
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,299
thank in particular Martha said ermine

289
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:05,808
who's by my project partner on this this

290
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:07,849
is a this was largely funded from a sips

291
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,828
Schmidt out Novak small Grants Program I

292
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,600
also want to thank from the Mazurek lab

293
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:13,849
Carla plant and helped us to brainstorm

294
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,699
these methods these methods have these

295
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,589
methods for our project I'd like to

296
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:19,998
thank everyone in the Mutchler breeding

297
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,300
program and in the francis breeding

298
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:25,308
program at osu and also my graduate of

299
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:26,719
committee members and with that i think

300
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:31,299
i have a couple more minutes here to

301
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,910
take questions stop sharing the screen

302
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:37,219
you can type if you have questions can

303
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:41,419
take one minute for one minute for

304
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,459
question running out of time any leads

305
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:47,568
on the background of devon surprise so

306
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:49,698
the trail stops there I tried looking up

307
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:51,919
so I was able to find the company that

308
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:54,558
sold Devon surprise but they've folded

309
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,049
long ago I don't I can't identify who

310
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:58,879
the breeder is so I think from this

311
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:01,729
point forward we're gonna try and find a

312
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,259
wild species that that is that best

313
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,110
supports introgression and Devon

314
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:07,818
surprise and and make our best claim

315
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,600
that that's the ultimate source in this

316
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:13,849
resistance let's see like the historic

317
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,069
approach thank you very much do you

318
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,470
think that on reducing the haplotype

319
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:20,419
sizes for finer mapping you could be

320
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,678
confounding the effects of other

321
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:26,000
potential causal qtls

322
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:29,678
do I think that reducing the haplotype

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,678
sizes for finer mapping I

324
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,169
I'm sure I totally understand the

325
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,990
question there but I don't think that

326
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:38,419
where we are confounding the effects I

327
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,190
think we could be leaving out other QTL

328
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,139
and in fact I have already left out

329
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,300
several QTL that were of minor effect

330
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,330
here we really wanted to focus on the

331
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:49,609
largest QTL of interest large defect QTL

332
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,629
of interest because that's really what

333
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,860
the breeding programs are most

334
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,620
interested in when they're trying to

335
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,839
bring these into their background and

336
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:00,379
then another question what tool were

337
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:04,610
using for haplotype visualization so I

338
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:07,039
used Python for creating the to do the

339
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,839
k-means clustering analysis and then the

340
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,838
these plots are actually based on

341
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,830
they're actually just ggplot bar plots

342
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,570
in which I've stripped out all of the

343
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,050
unnecessary background detail all the

344
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,720
grids and everything and used facet wrap

345
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:26,750
to stack all of the entries on top of

346
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:31,430
each other so that we can do comparisons

347
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:35,299
across entries nice I think that is one

348
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:37,429
more question do we have markers for key

349
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:39,799
tl5 and key tl9 that seed companies

350
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:41,359
could use yes I mean we currently have

351
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,219
markers that we are using in our own

352
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,800
breeding program but really the purpose

353
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,778
for that are the motivating factor for

354
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,269
that all of this work is to define

355
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:52,759
markers that will be useful for all

356
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,528
backgrounds so yes we currently have

357
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,750
markers that could be used they may not

358
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:59,149
be polymorphic in all backgrounds but we

359
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,370
hope that by the end of this work they

360
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:06,200
will be robust enough for any and all

361
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:08,299
programs to use them okay I think there

362
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,270
are no more questions let's thank Taylor

363
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:14,769
for your nice work and move on to the

364
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,769
third speaker thank you
