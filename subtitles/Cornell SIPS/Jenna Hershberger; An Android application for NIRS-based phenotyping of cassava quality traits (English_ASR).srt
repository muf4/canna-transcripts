1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,740
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:08,599
University all right thanks Sarah as she

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,580
said my name is Jenna Hershberger I'm a

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,250
second year grad student in my course

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,109
lab and today I'll be talking about one

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,268
of several projects that I'm working on

7
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:18,739
and this one's called an Android

8
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:21,079
application for near-infrared

9
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:23,928
spectroscopy based you know typing of

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,689
Kesava quality traits so this project is

11
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:29,088
part of a larger Fino Apps project

12
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:32,418
that's funded by NSF

13
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:34,250
and this project is led by Mike Gore as

14
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:38,359
well as Jesse Poland who is here a few

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,280
weeks ago so the main problem that the

16
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:44,000
pheno apps project is looking to address

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,340
is this one typically when reading

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,829
programs take notes it's by hand on

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:53,750
paper you get bookshelves that look like

20
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:57,019
this this is an actual photo from ITA of

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,740
their breeding data also lovingly known

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:04,159
as old-school cassava base so you know

23
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:08,090
apps integrate data collection with the

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,700
actual new cassava base out of BTI and

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,560
that's one way that we are increasing

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,409
the efficiency with which breeding

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,019
programs can take phenotypic data but

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,670
beyond this Fino apps also have the

29
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:22,938
possibility of collecting data that's

30
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:27,200
not possible by hand such as spectral

31
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:29,118
data and image data so one of the other

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,700
important parts of the pheno apps

33
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,039
project is workshops so deployment of

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,100
the apps and this these are pictures

35
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:40,909
from a workshop that we held at iit a in

36
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:44,298
march and so we train breeders on how to

37
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,700
use the apps and ask for feedback on the

38
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:48,950
apps that are being used and then

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,740
potential apps that could be developed

40
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,840
in the future so we asked the breeders

41
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:57,138
what traits are you working on that

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,259
could use a more efficient tool and we

43
00:01:57,138 --> 00:02:02,868
got a lot of responses so one of them

44
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,840
that we hadn't really put too much

45
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:10,008
thought into before is dry matter

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,979
content in cassava so dry matter content

47
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,239
is really important to cassava breeders

48
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,599
to farmers and to

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,219
consumers cassava roots are the

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,710
harvested part of the plant they're

51
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:24,349
mostly starch in the dry matter is what

52
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,849
is actually cared about so the dry

53
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,009
matter is a large component of yield

54
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,319
it's used as a proxy for eating quality

55
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:32,599
and it's really important for farmers

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,650
which factors into then variety adoption

57
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:40,699
as they want to grow crops that are

58
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,920
actually going to be consumed by Zoomers

59
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:46,219
and can be used for processing for

60
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,559
eating things like that so the problem

61
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,539
though is cassava dry matter can be

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,340
difficult to measure so there are two

63
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,289
main ways that it's normally measured

64
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,650
through the specific gravity method and

65
00:02:54,289 --> 00:03:00,109
the oven method so on the right we have

66
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,500
the specific gravity method as measured

67
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:07,280
last year in one of Hollis fields Paul

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,860
is another lab member of mine so this

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,140
method takes you take the roots still in

70
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,450
the field take a subset of them from

71
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,699
your plot weigh them in air and then in

72
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,679
water and use a simple equation to

73
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:20,869
translate that into dry matter content

74
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,909
the other method is the oven method

75
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,189
which you take your samples back to the

76
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:27,169
lab you peel your roots you shred them

77
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:29,240
you measure them before and after they

78
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:32,959
go through the drying process and that's

79
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,360
how you get dry matter content the there

80
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,969
is though a third way that people have

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,850
started using and this is nears or

82
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:43,909
near-infrared spectroscopy so this is

83
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,799
being used as it's there's a benchtop

84
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,359
spectrometer that's being used to see

85
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,850
out there other organizations as well

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:56,620
that have jumped on board and it's been

87
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:59,659
proven highly accurate fast and also

88
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,219
yeah it's just very useful so the

89
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,379
problem though is you still have to take

90
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,569
all your samples back to the lab process

91
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,849
them and then put them through the

92
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:12,799
spectrometer so there's another version

93
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:15,769
of this where instead of being in the

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,420
lab you have a handheld unit and so this

95
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,180
is something that you go out of Jean

96
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,759
Luc's lab is exploring and he has shown

97
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,400
that also that method can have high

98
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,978
accuracy but the problem with these is

99
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,929
the cost is prohibitive so before I go

100
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,668
into that I'm going to talk a little bit

101
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,959
about what yours is

102
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:40,029
so Neer's is this region of the

103
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,239
electromagnetic spectrum from 700 to

104
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:45,008
2500 nanometers and the reflectance as

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,110
measured by a spectrometer can be

106
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:50,009
indicative of the chemical composition

107
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,240
of whatever you're measuring so it

108
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:55,389
changes the reflectance patterns based

109
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,750
on the carbon hydrogen nitrogen hydrogen

110
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,600
and oxygen hydrogen bonds total carbon

111
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,310
carbon and nitrogen so this chart shows

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,250
some of the properties that can be

113
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,530
measured by nears and then this is a

114
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,160
screenshot from one of the apps we're

115
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:15,369
working on that shows some variation

116
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,849
between different routes for these

117
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:22,030
traits so because the cost is

118
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:24,250
prohibitive for the NIR spectra

119
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:26,049
spectroscopy but it's a promising

120
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,779
technology we've been looking into lower

121
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,050
cost options to use nearest in the field

122
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:34,629
so we found this device it's called scio

123
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,728
it has a smaller range than what's been

124
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,399
used in the past to measure dry matter

125
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:41,978
content in cassava and so in order to

126
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:44,589
move forward with this technology I've

127
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:47,110
been working with Hugo to subset his

128
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:50,259
data from his handheld years that has

129
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,810
high accuracy and see if this range is

130
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:57,189
still accurate in predicting dry matter

131
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:59,769
using his developed models so with that

132
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:04,000
we've gone we have reduced the accuracy

133
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:07,569
from 96.7% with holdout cross-validation

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,288
to 93.3 but 93.3 is still pretty high

135
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:15,848
for a tool that is a 200 times reduction

136
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:19,629
in price so this each unit is about 300

137
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:21,728
dollars instead of tens of thousands of

138
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,550
dollars so we're looking at something

139
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:26,709
that is actually feasible for breeders

140
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,629
to be using in their programs and could

141
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:31,870
be really useful in taking dry matter

142
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:35,310
data quickly in the field without having

143
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:39,430
to transport samples and also accurately

144
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,839
so in order to then move forward with

145
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,180
this project Paul

146
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,519
I set up a small pilot experiment

147
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,579
upstairs in the lab here using roots

148
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,899
from Wegmans and that you can see in the

149
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,060
picture on the left here we're just

150
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,019
practicing the protocol for scanning the

151
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,350
roots

152
00:06:53,019 --> 00:07:00,039
the device has a small plastic shield by

153
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,740
the actual spectrometer and that you can

154
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,720
put flesh with the root slice which the

155
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,990
roots are already sliced a phenotype for

156
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,910
a different diseases so handy there you

157
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,710
can just use the slices that are already

158
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:17,860
cut and scan them so we've worked on the

159
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:20,469
protocol and now have moved into a pilot

160
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,229
field trial so Paula is currently in

161
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,630
Uganda harvesting her G wast trial for

162
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:29,379
softness and the roots are already being

163
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:31,509
phenotyped for specific gravity as well

164
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:34,209
as these disease traits that require the

165
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:36,159
slicing of the root so we've hired an

166
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,918
extra team member for her to be able to

167
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,919
scan the roots as part of the

168
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,469
phenotyping process and these same roots

169
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,418
are then being taken first the specific

170
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,190
gravity measurements and we also have

171
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:52,089
some of them going for the oven method

172
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:54,610
just to round it all out so this harvest

173
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,049
is taking place starting this week

174
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,569
these pictures are actually from last

175
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,250
year but this is the idea of what will

176
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:05,620
be happening so and then after we get

177
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,439
the data from this pilot trial we will

178
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,870
then be making some prediction models

179
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,969
I'm looking into using partially squares

180
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,240
regression which will reduce the

181
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,020
dimensionality of the spectral data and

182
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,319
account for the multi collinearity

183
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:22,180
between wavelengths and then we'll be

184
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,550
doing some cross-validation and then

185
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,459
hopefully some auditioning additional

186
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:31,270
phenotyping for model improvement with

187
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:34,059
more more measurements of dry matter and

188
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:37,000
scans prepared to be able to predict

189
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,848
better and ultimately all this will be

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,309
packaged into an app for Android that

191
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:45,850
will be able to join the rest of the

192
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:48,489
pheno apps in this suite of apps that

193
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,210
are all free on Google Play for breeders

194
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,669
to use and

195
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,950
with that I would like to thank Paula

196
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:57,870
and ago especially for their help on my

197
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,240
project as well as my committee Mike

198
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:11,278
Rebecca and Tim the rest of the gore lab

199
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:13,970
the pheno ops team and so thanks and

200
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,970
I'll take questions

201
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:40,528
yeah so with those we really doubt

202
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:42,480
there's a lot of variation with those

203
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:44,700
routes we did measure them using a

204
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,740
drying oven and there wasn't a ton of

205
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,509
variation but some of the routes were

206
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,049
actually statistically different from

207
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:55,350
each other in dry matter so we are

208
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:58,349
waiting on a research license to be able

209
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,470
to look at the actual spectra to start

210
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,480
our actual model development so we don't

211
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,629
know right now how that's going to look

212
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,259
but we'll see that's why we actually

213
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:13,100
need a pilot experiment to larger scale

214
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,100
be able to tell

215
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,570
yeah

216
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:29,299
so yeah so for this tool it has a little

217
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:31,909
cover on it that you can take off and

218
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,769
then turn the device over put it back in

219
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,028
the cover and you press a button and it

220
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,250
will calibrate for you

221
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:39,679
so in our protocol we're doing that

222
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,899
between plots it's probably a little bit

223
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:52,849
overkill but we'd rather have that then

224
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:54,230
not have it correctly calibrated okay

225
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:01,399
all right if there are no more questions

226
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:03,170
let's thank Jenna one more time this has

227
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,919
been a production of Cornell University

228
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:08,919
