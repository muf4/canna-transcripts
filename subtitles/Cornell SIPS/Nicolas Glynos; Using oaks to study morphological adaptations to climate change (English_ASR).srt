in December he keeps apologizing for not

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,480
having all this data for accuracy that's

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,840
a very impressive data that we already

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,810
got in great experimental filming after

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,000
graduation next consent many times to

11
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:35,769
work until the August where I'll start a

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,628
ph.d program utilizing small pockets

change in corporate school Jesus the

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,519
Latin name in there alright everybody my

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,780
name is Nick and this is the project

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,790
I've been working on for about the past

18
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,350
year now and as Mike said I'm going to

19
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,149
continue to work on it over the summer

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,070
and in the next semester and it's part

21
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:01,719
of my honors thesis here and I've been

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:04,659
working on with with Kevin Nixon so as

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,340
Mike mentioned I and still in the

24
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,810
process of continuing on this project so

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,520
this is basically just a status update

26
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,478
of where I am and where I plan to be in

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,798
the next year and as a quick outline

28
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,328
today I'm going to talk about just an

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,030
introduction and the goals of the

30
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:20,498
project so what we're trying to do and

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,840
how we plan to do that and then some of

32
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:24,399
the methods that we're going to and that

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,609
we have been using over the last year

34
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:28,778
and how those methods are aligning with

35
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:30,158
some of the methods I've been used in

36
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:31,899
the past and maybe some new things as

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,159
well that haven't been used and then

38
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,019
also mentioned some of the results that

39
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,329
we expect to get and some of the future

40
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:41,739
work over the summer and the next

41
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:44,228
semester so as an introduction it's

42
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,638
important to note that there's been a

43
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:47,649
really strong correlation between leaf

44
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,868
shape and climate for several several

45
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:53,439
decades ecologists and botanists have

46
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:55,688
noticed that weeds that are for example

47
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,309
thin and highly dissected or highly

48
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:59,739
tooth's have highly toothed margins are

49
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,359
more often found in the northern more

50
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:04,269
temperate regions of the United States

51
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:06,818
or of the world and leaves that are

52
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:08,199
thicker and with entire margins are

53
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,560
often found in wetter

54
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,509
more tropical climates and also leaves

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,259
they're much smaller thicker and maybe

56
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,379
you're more spiny

57
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,459
are found in dry climates and desert

58
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,348
desert habitat

59
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,780
and these correlate is a lot there are

60
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,889
several hypotheses that can tell us why

61
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,209
weaves are shaped this way and the

62
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,419
correlations that that go along with

63
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,438
climate in the morphological variation

64
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,149
but a lot of the previous work is just

65
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:32,650
focused on these general characteristics

66
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,218
of leaves they've looked at leaf shape

67
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,859
and maybe deciduous versus evergreen

68
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:39,968
characteristics but this project in this

69
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,019
project we plan to look at some

70
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,280
characteristics that are going to be a

71
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,019
little bit more specific and maybe tell

72
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,729
us a little bit more about the

73
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:47,379
adaptations that leaves have the climate

74
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,959
and maybe allow us to make some

75
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:52,959
hypotheses about why leaves are shaped

76
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,479
the way they are so the inspiration for

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,150
this project came from a pretty simple

78
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,009
question and that's why our oak leaf

79
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,519
shaped so differently if you guys have

80
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:05,259
any experience with oak taxonomy or oak

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,269
morphology then you've noticed that

82
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:09,908
there's a huge variation and the shape

83
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:14,438
of their leaves the habitats they occupy

84
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:16,750
and and their lifestyle as well so we

85
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:18,729
wanted to try to answer that question

86
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,829
and in doing that we hope to achieve a

87
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,149
few goals and the first goal is to

88
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,219
determine the leaf characteristics and

89
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,930
oak leaves that are most adapted to

90
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,789
certain climates we want to make some

91
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,859
really specific and precise measurements

92
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:31,030
to be able to make hypotheses about why

93
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,859
leaves are shaped the way they are and

94
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,750
hopefully correlate that to the specific

95
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,729
climates they occupy and we can also

96
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,068
develop methods that can be used for

97
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,349
other more fug other morphological

98
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,658
studies and other taxa so we're going to

99
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:45,638
do a lot of digital morphological

100
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:47,289
measurements that can hopefully be not

101
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,790
only used for Oaks but maybe other taxon

102
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:51,448
the future and then can also be applied

103
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:53,948
to things like niche modeling or

104
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:58,239
taxonomic purposes so that we can better

105
00:03:53,949 --> 00:04:01,000
understand how morphology relates to

106
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,030
adaptation and and habitat preference

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,299
and then we can also use these

108
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,859
correlations that we that we find to

109
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,449
improve our predictions about paleo

110
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,569
climate so for example if we know that

111
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:15,909
the flora of a certain area has leaf

112
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:17,918
characteristics of a certain of a

113
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:21,939
certain type and we can look at a fossil

114
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,288
flora and make correlations between the

115
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,939
leaves that we see today and the climate

116
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:27,979
say inhabit and the Paleo climate

117
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:32,689
of that of the time when that one of

118
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:35,509
those fossil flora so why do we choose

119
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:38,899
Oaks well they've got a really immense

120
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:43,849
and diverse morphological geographical

121
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:46,819
and and habitat preference as I

122
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,410
mentioned before they are extremely

123
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:53,839
diverse there's over 400 species of Oaks

124
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,660
and they range from enormous deciduous

125
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,359
trees to evergreen rhizomatous shrubs

126
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,950
and they have habitats ranging from the

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,620
northern temperate climates into the end

128
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,079
of the subtropics and tropics and their

129
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,720
weak morphology is equally as variable

130
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,089
so looking at very different leaf size

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,250
from some of the extremes here over to

132
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:16,189
some of the smaller leaves here leaf

133
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,579
shape there's lobed margins you see

134
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:22,370
entire margins you see deeper lobes

135
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:24,019
margins with many spines and the

136
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,199
variation is really a minced that you

137
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:28,789
see see in Oaks and it's it's no

138
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,500
surprise that they also have a really

139
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,110
broad geographical distribution so

140
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,389
you'll see them from southern Canada all

141
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,910
the way into the subtropics and tropics

142
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:42,349
of northern South America and also from

143
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:47,270
coast to coast in the United States and

144
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:48,919
this is this all is also a testament to

145
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:51,769
the diversity of habitats that they

146
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:54,049
occupy so you'll find them in temperate

147
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:57,409
cooler regions in the North drier

148
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,750
regions in the southwest and wet even

149
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,169
cloud forest regions in the sub tropics

150
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,730
and tropical tropical locations so based

151
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:05,930
on their diverse morphology their

152
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,140
geographic wide geographical

153
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,139
distribution and their really broad

154
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,668
habitat ability to edit adapt to

155
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,959
different habitats they make an ideal

156
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:16,969
group to study these correlations

157
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:21,219
between morphology and climate and in

158
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,220
addition to that we also happen to have

159
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:35,009
not wanting to go there yeah yeah in

160
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,869
addition to that we also happen to have

161
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,819
the largest collection of Oaks in the

162
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:42,960
world at the at the herbarium here at

163
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:46,499
Cornell we have we have a collection of

164
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,930
over 230 oak species and over 13,000

165
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:51,149
data-based accessions of oak specimens

166
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,098
so this really makes it for an ideal

167
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:56,550
group to study to to look on this

168
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:58,319
project so on to some of the methods in

169
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,360
how I plan to look for these

170
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,539
correlations and measure these these

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,649
differences we can do a lot of the work

172
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,509
that I've been talking about with

173
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:08,309
basically just herbarium specimens and

174
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,080
using in a very impression we can take a

175
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:11,520
look at the label and get collection

176
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,128
information on where that session was

177
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,808
look collected and we can pinpoint that

178
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,330
on a map with a latitude and longitude

179
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:20,370
coordinate and once we have latitude and

180
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:23,639
longitude coordinates for the entire

181
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,680
species or for the entire for the entire

182
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,129
species of our collection then we can

183
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,288
map those map all of the species onto a

184
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,778
map and produce a range map of that

185
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:36,688
species and then we can take the

186
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:38,579
specific coordinate for the species of

187
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,319
it or the specimen of interest and we

188
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:45,359
can look at the specific climatic

189
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,580
conditions that that specimen was was in

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,889
when it was collected and we can go back

191
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,899
to the original specimen and take take a

192
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,098
look at the take a look at the leaf

193
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,999
characteristics and make make some

194
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,338
really detailed and precise

195
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,269
morphological measurements and putting

196
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:59,309
all these things together then we're

197
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,050
able to take geography climate and

198
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:02,909
morphology and put that into one

199
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,439
framework that we can be able to use for

200
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:06,209
comparisons and to be able to make

201
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,159
hypotheses about how these leaves are

202
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,288
adapting and surviving in these

203
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:13,860
different habitats so to go into a

204
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:15,058
little bit more detail to do the geo

205
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,559
referencing we're using a software

206
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:19,919
called geo locate that was produced by

207
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:20,969
Tulane University and this is a like I

208
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,338
said just taking information right off

209
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:26,399
that are barium label and typing that

210
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:29,550
right into this software interface in

211
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,578
the Geo locate software and usually you

212
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,680
can get a pretty accurate estimation of

213
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,120
where that specimen was collected for

214
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,328
example this one says I don't know if

215
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,408
you can

216
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:40,678
read about it San Bernardino National

217
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:43,918
Forest near route 38 and the point comes

218
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:45,688
really near near to that string that you

219
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,088
typed in and it prints out a latitude

220
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:50,248
longitude coordinate for you to

221
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,029
automatically apply to that specimen but

222
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,989
it's not this was not always the case

223
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,149
there's always going to be some

224
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:56,309
uncertainty with your with the

225
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,749
collection information on the label for

226
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,818
example sometimes the collector will

227
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:02,339
write 10 miles west of Sedona and with

228
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:04,259
that you don't have much much precision

229
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,459
and you've got to make a pretty broad

230
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,259
estimation about where that specimen was

231
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,268
located and in addition to our

232
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,249
collection in the herbarium we can also

233
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,078
use G Biff which is a global

234
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:15,360
biodiversity information facility and

235
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:19,828
this is a database and online database

236
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,220
of nearly 2 million species and I think

237
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:24,748
over 700 million individual specimens

238
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,939
that have been geo-referenced and

239
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:28,819
database in a similar way is this so we

240
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:31,139
can mine that data and be able to

241
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,798
compare that to the data that we're

242
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,818
collecting in the herbarium and also to

243
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:38,009
field studies that will that I'll be

244
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:39,208
doing in the summer and to eliminate the

245
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,278
uncertainty with some of the geo

246
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:43,109
referencing the best way to do that is

247
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,720
to go and make field collections with

248
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:50,308
precise geographical coordinates and and

249
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,019
better collection information on the

250
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:54,659
specimen so that's that it's going to be

251
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,129
done this summer and to access climate

252
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,409
data we're going to be using world climb

253
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,778
which is a global which is a world

254
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:03,149
largest global climate database and it

255
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:03,899
contains over 40,000 weather stations

256
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,188
across the world

257
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,558
each of these red dots on the map

258
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:10,248
represents a individual weather station

259
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:14,278
and this database produces an

260
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:16,798
interpolated continuous grid of climate

261
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,749
data such that you can input any

262
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:23,278
latitude longitude coordinate and get a

263
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:25,319
unique climate profile for that latitude

264
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,110
longitude coordinate and there's a

265
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:29,998
variety of climatic variables that will

266
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,188
that are presented in this database

267
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:35,129
including variables on precipitation

268
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:37,618
temperature and several other different

269
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:38,730
variables as well and to do

270
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,290
morphological measurements were going to

271
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,019
be using the online herbarium database

272
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,219
that we that we have access to and this

273
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,048
is just an example of what the page

274
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,720
looks like and this is several different

275
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:49,980
specimens of one specific species and

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,769
you can go ahead and choose one

277
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:57,240
species and embedded right into this

278
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,419
into the herbarium database website we

279
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,980
have implemented a system of

280
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:04,500
morphological measurements so that we

281
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,940
can write on it right on the database be

282
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,389
able to measure things like petiole

283
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,350
length

284
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:12,840
leaf length leaf width distance to the

285
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,629
widest point perimeter of the leaf

286
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,310
surface area of the leaf and even you

287
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,809
can count the number of primary and

288
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,539
secondary veins you can measure vein

289
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,519
angle and you can count and measure the

290
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,949
depth and degree of spining and lo being

291
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,360
on all the leaves so this is really

292
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,870
going to make the morphological

293
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,149
measurement process extremely efficient

294
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,440
and quick and not only that it's going

295
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:39,029
to allow us to have sort of a digital

296
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,040
paper trail of every single measurement

297
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,259
that we make such that every measurement

298
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,049
will be instantly updated and correlated

299
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,220
to that specimen and lock to it and if

300
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,659
we need to go back and modify

301
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,980
measurement to review the measurements

302
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,230
that we made we can always do that

303
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,240
because this measurement system is

304
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,100
embedded in the herbarium database and

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,230
we'll be able to have that all connected

306
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,970
and correlated at all time so this is a

307
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,980
big jump or a big change from the

308
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,690
previous ways of just measuring leaves

309
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,639
without with a ruler or with with some

310
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,890
with old instrumentation so once once we

311
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,539
collect a lot of the data then we'll

312
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:16,860
have a large matrix that includes

313
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,899
several different species these are the

314
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,580
ones I've been working with recently and

315
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,500
they're mostly Western Oaks the numbers

316
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,509
beside them indicate the number of

317
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,970
specimens we have data based and imaged

318
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,840
in the herbarium right now and then as I

319
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,220
mentioned we'll have several different

320
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,980
morphological characteristics that we'll

321
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,690
measure as well and a host of climatic

322
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,490
variables that will be correlated to

323
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,690
each individual specimen and then we can

324
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,129
go ahead and make some attempt to make

325
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,170
correlations and do some analyses

326
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:45,419
between the different species which

327
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:48,149
we'll look at some of the different

328
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,589
adaptations and some of the different

329
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,600
characteristics of these species that

330
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,310
are allowing them to adapt and occupy

331
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,899
different habitats and we can also look

332
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,339
at variation within species that will

333
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,519
maybe tell us something about phenotypic

334
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,230
plasticity and some of the variation

335
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,240
that we see in individual plants and

336
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,720
then we can take the whole matrix and

337
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,209
look at very

338
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,920
in across space and time so looking at

339
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,929
how these things vary with geography and

340
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,539
over time as well because we have a

341
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:15,328
collection that ranges in the herbarium

342
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:18,240
of over 150 years of collections of

343
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:22,500
specimens so being able to do all these

344
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,259
will hopefully lead to some conclusions

345
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,490
that will support our hypotheses and the

346
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,649
expected results that we hope to see

347
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,149
here definitely we want to see some some

348
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,919
type of correlation between morphology

349
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,149
and climate and there's been a lot of

350
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,409
like I mentioned a lot of correlations

351
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,480
in the past that have made between low

352
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,799
being and to thing of leaves and we hope

353
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,028
to make come up with something that's a

354
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,909
little bit more specific and maybe a

355
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:44,879
little bit more applicable to oksu and

356
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:47,188
then we also hope to hope to improve the

357
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,829
phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution of

358
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:52,068
Oaks the phylogeny of Oaks is

359
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:55,708
notoriously unresolved and very

360
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:57,509
difficult to interpret because of a

361
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,758
large degree of phenotypic plasticity

362
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:02,459
and hybridization was in the genus so

363
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,680
being able to make these precise and

364
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,628
efficient morphological measurements may

365
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,448
improve the the phylogeny and taxonomy

366
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:11,670
of the group and we also hope to maybe

367
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,109
improve niche modeling methods and Mitch

368
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:17,308
modeling in the past is basically just

369
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:20,610
just used geographic distributions of

370
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:23,698
species to estimate the ranges of where

371
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,139
those species habitats are but if we can

372
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,698
implement morphological characteristics

373
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,899
that correlate with climate into those

374
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:30,870
niche models we may be able to better

375
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:35,009
understand why and how some species

376
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:37,679
adapt to certain certain regions and in

377
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,568
the future a big portion of this summer

378
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,849
is going to be devoted to a plant

379
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:44,698
collecting trip across the southwestern

380
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,120
US into California and up into the

381
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:50,068
northwest to document collect and

382
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,698
photograph several different oak species

383
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:56,458
to not only make comparisons to some of

384
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,109
the geo referencing and the already

385
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,388
collected specimens that we have but

386
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,350
also to improve the data set and add to

387
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,899
the herbarium collection that we have

388
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,319
here and in doing that I'm going to use

389
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,318
this

390
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:14,139
because a prototype planetpress that I

391
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:17,529
hope to help out with the collections

392
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:18,639
and I'm calling it the plexi press so

393
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,679
it's just basically two sheets of

394
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,539
plexiglass that you can carry in the

395
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,509
field it'll be light and easy and it

396
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:27,519
will allow imaging and it'll be able to

397
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,799
be scaled and then those can be uploaded

398
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,179
to the herbarium website and

399
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,009
measurements can be made throughout the

400
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,599
summer and in addition to that we can

401
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,730
also hopefully improve the morphological

402
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,379
measurement interface so that we can

403
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,139
make make better and more precise

404
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:43,149
measurements as we go on so to wrap up

405
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,649
I've got to have a big thanks to Kevin

406
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,959
Dixon who is my research advisor who

407
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,120
supported me a lot throughout this this

408
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,070
project also to Anna and Peter in the

409
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,899
herbarium they've been a huge help

410
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,850
throughout the whole whole process and

411
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,659
also to the plant science committee

412
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,430
Elena

413
00:15:55,659 --> 00:16:00,129
Chris and Mike for helping out with

414
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,750
presentation and advice and to

415
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:24,340
undergraduate research grants that are

416
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:25,600
going to support the summer yeah so they

417
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,310
definitely co-occur in this area but

418
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,110
they may have a ranges that differ so

419
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:30,819
you may find that chestnut oak has a

420
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,879
range that's not the same as a white oak

421
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,230
or a red oak so if we can use

422
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,309
collections from across that range and

423
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,769
be able to correlate those

424
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:39,849
characteristics to different areas and

425
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,379
we can maybe come up with better

426
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,980
hypotheses about why they have the

427
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,980
shapes they do yes a long one

428
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:56,259
yeah the phenotypic plasticity is huge

429
00:16:52,769 --> 00:17:01,500
how does that would it be better to look

430
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:04,779
at the plasticity three positions axis

431
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,750
rather than thousands of marbles I'm

432
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:09,579
Valerie yes overlapping ranges but since

433
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,559
in genetics consolidation different

434
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:16,449
morphology rather than a lot yeah

435
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,009
absolutely so that's something that I

436
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,960
think it's possible with this project so

437
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,490
the fact that we're going to have so

438
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,350
many samples such a large sample size

439
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,269
for each species allow us to do that

440
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:30,389
within species comparison and among

441
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:30,389
species comparison yep

442
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,740
I'd say yes and especially so with Oaks

443
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:48,109
even even more so with Oaks you can look

444
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,680
on on one oak branch and see leaves that

445
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:53,509
have really distinct morphologies and in

446
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,000
the field of summer that's going to be

447
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:58,519
hopefully avoided by making collections

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,200
that are standard with with methodology

449
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:17,629
as standard along each each specimen and

450
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:19,160
individual yep yeah absolutely I think

451
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,080
that's maybe the ultimate goal is to get

452
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,240
everything automated just so you can

453
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,829
take a picture of a leaf or take a

454
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,210
picture of a thousand leaves and put

455
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,740
them through an automated system to come

456
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,319
up with all these morphological

457
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,789
characteristics and I think that yeah

458
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,740
that would be the ultimate goal but for

459
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,740
now it's just done by hand

460
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:58,039
mm-hmm yeah this has been a production

461
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:01,839
of Cornell University on the web at

462
