1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,169
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:11,329
University connection and thank you all

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:14,330
for coming it's really ok you hear me

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,390
yeah ok it's really great to to see all

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,640
of you here and I'm very excited to

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,649
present my research on route and

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,920
rhizosphere processes in forest soils

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:30,549
today I'm actually not the first Dutch

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,590
person to observe routes or study routes

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,530
all right so FinCEN franco was way ahead

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,570
of me he observed and painted tree roots

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,399
and the reason for him that he got so

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,130
interested in roots is was because to

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,420
him tree roots represented the struggle

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,520
of life well he wasn't the most

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,710
optimistic person and I would not use

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,430
roots as a metaphor of my own life or

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,910
even my own PhD but I would argue that

19
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:00,530
roots can really be a struggle to study

20
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:03,140
there they're hidden away in the soil

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,969
they're hard to get to and it's hard to

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:09,290
like observe them under natural

23
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:11,840
conditions but once you find methods or

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,460
you use all their methods to to study

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,939
them and learn new things about them

26
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,469
they are truly fascinating and on top of

27
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,509
that they play a very important role in

28
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,489
the cycling of carbon and nutrients

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,010
through our environments so I would

30
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:26,750
argue that they're definitely studying

31
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:32,659
them is definitely worth the struggle

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:36,049
and I hope you you agree with me so the

33
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,909
roots dead then go painted here are more

34
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,619
woody structural roots and those are not

35
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,080
the roadstead that I was interested in

36
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,390
for my dissertation there is I was

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,250
interested in our fine roots so those

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,629
are really smallest roots of their roots

39
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,079
it's them we're talking really about the

40
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:52,879
millimeter scale here and these these

41
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,920
roots are also ephemeral meaning that

42
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,920
after a certain period of time they're

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,450
shed just like leaves on a tree but

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,030
unlike leaves on the tree their

45
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,100
production season and their death season

46
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,650
so to say are variable and their

47
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:10,280
lifespan can really vary from a few days

48
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,469
up to a few years this is also a part of

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,939
the root system that's in charge of

50
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:16,250
taking up water and nutrient

51
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:17,599
from the soil their de roots that

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,090
associated with beneficial

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,439
microorganisms in the soil and they're

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,569
also the part of the root system that

55
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,659
can quickly respond to changes in the

56
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:30,379
environments and they can do that by

57
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:31,430
producing roots in more roots in an area

58
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,439
of the soil where there's higher

59
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,599
nutrient availability or resource

60
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,620
availability but they can also do this

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,659
by changing their lifespan and besides

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,879
responding to the environment they also

63
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:47,270
have the ability to modify the soil

64
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,039
right around right around these roots so

65
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,300
the biological characteristics the

66
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,129
physical characteristics and the

67
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,439
chemical characteristics around the

68
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:57,019
roots in the soil are are very different

69
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:59,120
from from the rest of the soil and one

70
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,820
of the reason of the reasons for this is

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,550
root exudates it isn't the process by

72
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,500
which roots release chemicals into the

73
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:12,080
soil and I will talk more about this

74
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:15,080
about this in a bit at the ecosystem

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,580
scale fine roots growth dynamics are

76
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,920
very important part of the carbon cycle

77
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:25,100
in fact more than orange of organic

78
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:28,069
carbon found on land and is stored in

79
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,739
forests and a big part of that pool is

80
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,599
found below grounds as there in the

81
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,759
context of climate change one of the big

82
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,519
questions is what is going to happen

83
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,769
with this huge pool of carbon stored in

84
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,170
forests and one of the reasons that we

85
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,969
that we don't we aren't able to answer

86
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:45,919
that question yet is because we have a

87
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,489
very limited understanding of root soil

88
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,559
interactions and how and about how

89
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,739
changes in the environments might may

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,629
change those interactions so the aim of

91
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,789
my dissertation was to enhance our

92
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:01,489
understanding of root soil interactions

93
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:03,469
in a changing climate and I did this by

94
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:07,099
studying two different components within

95
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:08,810
this system so the first part of my

96
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,939
dissertation is about the effect of

97
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,219
droughts on fine grid production and

98
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,160
lifespan and then the second part of my

99
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:18,168
presentation or my dissertation is about

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,239
the effective route oxidation on soil

101
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,339
organic matter dynamics and so this is

102
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,089
also the way that I will guide you from

103
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,089
my talk today

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,610
right so the first part of my

105
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,040
dissertation the effects of drought on

106
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,930
on fine roots actually took place in

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Germany in collaboration with the

108
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,290
Technical University of Munich and I was

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,830
lucky enough to be able to take

110
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,240
advantage of this through fall exclusion

111
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:52,379
infrastructure that has been installed

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,360
in one of the forest nearby to study the

113
00:04:52,379 --> 00:05:02,459
response of fine roots to drought at the

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:04,560
field scale and studying route responses

115
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,449
to water resources in the soil is

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,000
particularly tricky because we expect

117
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,269
drought to affect find reproduction in

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,100
different ways so first of all water

119
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,899
resources are going to be more limiting

120
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,810
in the soil and so usually when we think

121
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,810
of a plant growing in in an environment

122
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,060
with limiting soil resources the

123
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,040
expectation is that the plant would

124
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,740
induce more biomass and more carbon

125
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,660
below grounds to to forage for those

126
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,610
resources and really spend its energy on

127
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,939
finding those resources in the soil and

128
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,069
taking them up however in the in the

129
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,629
scenario of a drought drought is also

130
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,180
going to influence above-ground

131
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:44,839
physiology of the tree and so one of the

132
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,280
main strategies by which trees can

133
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,829
minimize water loss is through closing

134
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,579
the stomata in the leaf leaves but that

135
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:56,789
also means that less co2 can be taken

136
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:59,939
out and so then we get into a scenario

137
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,069
where maybe the tree is limited in

138
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,500
Carmen resources and therefore also has

139
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:09,329
limited resources to spend on root

140
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,040
production so this was considered

141
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,750
there's really these two different

142
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,580
effects that that take place and it's

143
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,259
hard to predict because of that what

144
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,379
what would happen to find root growth

145
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,418
dynamics the low grounds and so studying

146
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,939
the effect of droughts in temperate

147
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,879
forest ecosystems is important because

148
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,040
the the duration the frequency and

149
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,620
severity of drought is predicted to go

150
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:37,280
up even in areas where trees are usually

151
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,680
not water limited an additional reason

152
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,109
for for

153
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,728
stirrers and this is I was working or

154
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,500
collaborating with force there's at the

155
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:46,930
Technical University of Munich is that

156
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,319
one of their most economically important

157
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,449
trees is Norway spruce and is this tree

158
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,909
species is particularly vulnerable to

159
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,770
drought and this might be partly due to

160
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,870
a shallow root system so all these roots

161
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:01,299
are in the layer of the soil that is

162
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,370
gonna dry out the fastest and these

163
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,530
trees are mainly grown in monoculture so

164
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,478
initial question is like why what can

165
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:09,609
what kind of management strategies could

166
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:11,379
we find to to mitigate these negative

167
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,340
effects of droughts on the root system

168
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:19,029
of very spruce so with this background

169
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:21,668
in mind I tested two hypotheses in this

170
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:23,739
study the first one being that drought

171
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:26,859
reduces fine reproductions but will

172
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,960
increase root lifespan and the rationale

173
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,210
behind this was is that the tree will

174
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,879
have limited carbon resources to to

175
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:35,138
build more roots but to compensate for

176
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,500
that the fine roots that are already

177
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,180
there are going to live for longer my

178
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,579
second hypothesis was that mixed species

179
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,069
arrangements will buffer the negative

180
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:49,779
effects of drought on fine reproduction

181
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:51,310
and to to further explain why why I

182
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:53,469
think that's gonna happen I have a

183
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,720
little diagram here so you can imagine a

184
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:00,520
forest a monoculture forest of spruce

185
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,949
trees on the on the left and so there's

186
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,779
gonna be a lot of fine roots in that

187
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,240
upper layer of the soil and they're

188
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:10,119
going to be competing for those limited

189
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,550
resources that are already there well if

190
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,620
you have a forest where there's forest

191
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,918
over there spruce trees and beech trees

192
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,610
that's the other species that I studied

193
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,319
here there's going to be fewer the the

194
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,229
the distribution of roots will be more

195
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,408
even and so also resources can be shared

196
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:32,500
more efficiently and more equally more

197
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,269
evenly and in addition because beech has

198
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,639
a deeper root system there might be

199
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,439
other mechanisms by which beech can

200
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:43,348
facilitate the fine reproduction of

201
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,349
spruce for example by by hydraulic lift

202
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,729
the way that I tested these hypothesis

203
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,350
was through a four year long field study

204
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,519
at the site which I already showed a

205
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,909
picture and

206
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,000
is this field side had ten research

207
00:08:54,909 --> 00:09:00,100
plots and that's had a species gradient

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,110
so she can seem to Graham in the middle

209
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,600
of the blood you see a mixed zone of

210
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,840
both beech and spruce trees and then on

211
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,370
the side monocultures of beech or spruce

212
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,530
and then half of these plots at full

213
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,250
through full extinction rooms were

214
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:21,579
installed on top of them and so these

215
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,399
roofs would close if it was raining but

216
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,139
then also during the winter months they

217
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,840
were also left open so really the idea

218
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,699
was here to study the effect of seasonal

219
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,440
like summer droughts or a drought during

220
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,190
the growing season on hybrid production

221
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,810
but we still let some soil moisture be

222
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:42,220
recharged during during the winter

223
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:44,439
months and the way that I I observed the

224
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,570
fine roads was by using mini raisa tron

225
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,970
methods so you can see a tube here and

226
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,040
that well the outside of the tube here

227
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,590
but it goes down to 50 centimeters and

228
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,379
the tube is see-through and so then with

229
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,509
cameras we can monitor if any new fine

230
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,750
roots are produced or how old the fine

231
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,639
roots are that that are already there

232
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,379
and so but we had to really come back

233
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,009
every two weeks to keep on monitoring

234
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:09,939
these roots and I want to thank

235
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,129
undergraduate researchers from the

236
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,420
Technical University of Munich for this

237
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:16,750
because they were really the one that

238
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:18,849
this most of the time and so we had 60

239
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,889
tubes and totals with six tubes per plot

240
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,399
and then we would come back there were

241
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:26,110
44 pictures per tube and then we would

242
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
come back every two weeks for almost to

243
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,070
eat for almost four years so we had a

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,789
lot of a lot of Route pictures to do

245
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,890
with and different members of them

246
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:38,289
barley lab helped me with analyzing all

247
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,569
these pictures I was I see Tommy sitting

248
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,879
here today and well there's a there's a

249
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,320
whole big group and Max even our lab

250
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,559
technician helps I want to also thank

251
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,850
all of you for all your help there

252
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:55,659
because I really couldn't have gotten

253
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:57,909
through all those pictures by myself we

254
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:00,850
also had soil moisture sensors installed

255
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:02,559
intuitive plots so that we could double

256
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,080
check that these through full exclusion

257
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,789
roofs are actually doing their job and

258
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,470
this is a graph where we see soil

259
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:10,629
moisture into upper 10 centimeters of

260
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,570
the soils we also had sensors installed

261
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:16,689
deeper down into the soil and this is

262
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,180
soil moisture all over the years of the

263
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,770
study and then they're also marked when

264
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,599
their roofs were closed versus when they

265
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,309
were open and so the thing that I want

266
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,519
you to take away from this graph is that

267
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,439
we have three red lines which represent

268
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,659
the drought treatment and three blue

269
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,400
lines and then there were soil moisture

270
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,559
sensors in the beach sprues and mixtone

271
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,169
but what I want to take away from is is

272
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,259
that the drought treatment is working so

273
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:43,509
we get reduced soil moisture when their

274
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,909
roofs are closed but also we can see

275
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:58,230
that even when the roofs are open soil

276
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:58,230
moisture isn't fully recharged all right

277
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:04,360
so the the first results that I'm

278
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,220
sharing with you are on the total amount

279
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,070
of fine words that were produced during

280
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,230
the four years of this study and so we

281
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,030
have I'm showing here pine root

282
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,920
production of beech and spruce and then

283
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,230
in the control plotting the drought

284
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,719
floods and so you can see deads drought

285
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,570
indeed significantly affected fine wood

286
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,850
production of spruce and and slightly of

287
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,650
beech so that's in line with our

288
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,769
hypothesis that we thought that drought

289
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:35,379
was gonna reduce fine reproduction and

290
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:37,210
then if we if we look at the mixed zone

291
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,860
of the plot so this is the total find

292
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,590
root production of both beech and spruce

293
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,019
together we do not see a reduction in

294
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:50,500
fine root production so that's also in

295
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:53,590
line with what I hypothesized then we

296
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,230
can also look at fine root production by

297
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,090
depth so here I'm showing you fine bird

298
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,879
production of spruce in beach in the

299
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,530
Indus Engle species zone of the plots as

300
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,379
there we see that fiber production is

301
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,600
reduced in the upper layers but also in

302
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,370
the deeper layers of the soil so even

303
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,409
though in the deeper layers of the soil

304
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,629
soil moisture was higher

305
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:16,360
we still see this reduction which

306
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,250
suggests that the trees indeed may have

307
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,639
been carbon limited so just couldn't

308
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,750
Purdue

309
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:26,189
as many words as they as they might have

310
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,830
on there under more ideal conditions

311
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:34,240
then if we look at the mixed species

312
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:37,210
zone we do not see this effect on earth

313
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,149
drought on this find reproduction of

314
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,490
spruce so and none of the layers we see

315
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:45,279
a reduction in find reproduction

316
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,379
well beech still shows a decrease in

317
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,870
fine reproduction from 10 to 20

318
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:52,240
centimeters soil depth and so we can

319
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,120
kind of average their results here over

320
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,980
those depth layers to kind of summarize

321
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,159
the results that we see in the mix

322
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,019
versus the singles species floods and so

323
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,409
we see that beach is equally affected by

324
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:08,110
the droughts in in the single and mixed

325
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,759
species own while spruce is only

326
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,980
affected by the drought in the spangles

327
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:21,340
treaty zone but not in the next species

328
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:23,409
own and so card part of this result

329
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,820
first fruits might be explained by

330
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:28,240
looking at the differences in soil

331
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,860
moisture between the singles species

332
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,610
zone of spruce and the mixed species

333
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,320
zone so if you look at the soil water

334
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,419
content in the drought plots of the

335
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,100
mixed species and spruce zone we see

336
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,839
that the soil moisture in the mixed

337
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,810
species zone is significantly higher

338
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:47,230
than in the single species zone so that

339
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:48,849
may explain part of why we see that

340
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:56,769
spruce is less affected by the drought

341
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:59,320
in the mixed zone to an estimate a fine

342
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:01,990
word lifespans of the routes that I was

343
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,379
observing I used Cox proportional

344
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:08,409
hazards models and a kaplan-meier

345
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:11,230
estimates and what we found for medium

346
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:13,480
lifespan is that both for screws and

347
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:17,440
Beach droughts increased fine with

348
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,230
lifespan in both the mix and the single

349
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,080
species zone so that's also in line with

350
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:27,399
if what what I have prophesized however

351
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,980
if we then look over these when we look

352
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,120
at this over the years and so a

353
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,589
different way to look at

354
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,950
medium lifespan or something that is

355
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:39,440
related to fine root lifespan is looking

356
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,820
at the hazard ratio so you can look at

357
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:47,300
the risk of death in the drought versus

358
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,060
the control plot and so hazard ratio

359
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:51,709
less than 1 in this case means that

360
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:54,349
there's a higher that there's a lower

361
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,800
risk of mortality in the drought floods

362
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,980
well a hazard ratio that is higher than

363
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:03,319
1 means a higher higher risk in the

364
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,528
drought floods so you can see for spruce

365
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,750
here that's throughout the years it's

366
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:10,519
hazard ratio is below 1 and the first

367
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,470
three years it's also it's significant

368
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,980
so it seems like it's response is quite

369
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:20,570
steady in a way however for beech we

370
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,519
only see a reduced risk of mortality

371
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,740
which would be linked to a longer

372
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,230
lifespan in in the first year of the

373
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,070
study and then for the next few years

374
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:34,089
it's that changes so this suggests that

375
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:38,540
maybe for beech this isn't a sustained

376
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:40,760
strategy under repeated episodes of

377
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,219
summer drought or maybe it's it's it's

378
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,610
utilizing other strategies to to deal

379
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:50,080
with this reduced soil moisture in the

380
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,080
soil moisture soil

381
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,000
so for all what do these what do these

382
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,730
results mean for for carbon cycling in

383
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,169
poor as well if we have less fine bird

384
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:05,209
production and the fine roots that are

385
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,859
already there are are getting older that

386
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:08,750
means that there is less there's going

387
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,879
to be less fine return over and the rate

388
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,759
and amount at which carbon would be

389
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,010
transferred into would be transferred to

390
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,099
a soil organic matter pool is is gonna

391
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:20,990
decrease however it seems that if we

392
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:23,240
look at mixed species arrangements or

393
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,088
mixed species for us that this negative

394
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,829
effect of drought may be mitigated to a

395
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:32,509
certain extent and especially because

396
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:36,189
spruce is the one that is benefiting

397
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:39,319
from from this mixed species composition

398
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:42,350
it seems like this could be a better

399
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:45,200
forest management strategy if foresters

400
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:47,359
want to cultivate Norway spruce

401
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:55,669
they're in a climate where maybe more

402
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:58,038
drought periods are to be expected all

403
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:07,549
right that brings me to the second part

404
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:09,829
of my dissertation in this second part I

405
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:13,970
I studied the effect of root exudates

406
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:16,548
chemistry on on soil carbon cycling my

407
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,788
interest in soil science and our new I

408
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:22,519
did my Master's like Tarun already said

409
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:25,250
in soil science with Johannes but really

410
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:30,620
my interest in soil go even further back

411
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:33,519
than that this is me as a child

412
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:36,079
practicing my soil sampling skills and

413
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,149
for everyone that has asked me over the

414
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,579
years if we wear clogs or wooden shoes

415
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:43,239
in the Netherlands we do and this is the

416
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,240
proof for that

417
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:49,250
so yeah I'm practicing my soil sampling

418
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:51,409
skills and I look a little confused

419
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,079
there's no organic matter in the soil

420
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:59,080
and there's there's no roots so what's

421
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:02,388
going on cuz we need this area where

422
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,500
roots and the soil meet is is an area

423
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:06,379
disorder that I find very interesting

424
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,888
and this interface is is also called

425
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,840
their Rice's sphere and this is really

426
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:14,048
two plays very roots interact with with

427
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,099
a diverse community of organisms of

428
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:19,908
microorganisms in vertebrates other

429
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:22,369
plant species and lately this region of

430
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,950
the soil has also been labeled as a

431
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:27,469
hotspot of biological activity meaning

432
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,600
that we can observe accelerated rates of

433
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:35,419
carbon and nutrient cycling in this

434
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:38,418
soils in this zone and a recent study

435
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:40,850
showed that these rhizosphere processes

436
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:42,970
may be responsible for up to one third

437
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:47,449
of all soil carbon mineralized in

438
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:51,380
forests and so this dis phenomenon is

439
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,480
also called root priming and so and one

440
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,059
of the main there's people have proposed

441
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,250
different mechanisms for why this is

442
00:19:56,058 --> 00:20:00,680
happening but one of the main

443
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,380
mechanisms attributes this effect to

444
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,750
root x addition so it is that this idea

445
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,840
of roots releasing chemicals into the

446
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,500
soil that then results in an increase or

447
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:17,179
decrease in organic matter decomposition

448
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,650
and so just to explain this hypothesis

449
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,519
that's out there in a little bit more

450
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,290
detail we can start with imagining a

451
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,720
soil without any roots and I show

452
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,460
there's a fix or carbon pool and we have

453
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,440
some microbes living in that soil that

454
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,660
are chewing away on this soil organic

455
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,190
matter and some of the carbon is leaving

456
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:39,290
the system as a co2 and then what what

457
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,289
has been commonly hypothesized is what

458
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:46,490
happens when we introduce roots into the

459
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:48,980
system is that roots are exuding label

460
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,819
carbon compounds organic compounds that

461
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,829
are easy to break down that then either

462
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:56,809
increase the activity of the microbes

463
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:59,809
that live there or even the abundance of

464
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,329
there microbes which then results in

465
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:06,049
them also decomposing more of this

466
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:09,259
carbon soil organic matter pool which

467
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:11,480
then results overall in a in a larger

468
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,730
flux of co2 leaving the system and of

469
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,960
course some of this co2 is coming from

470
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,910
the exit days that were that are

471
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:23,960
degraded and some of that is coming from

472
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:26,390
the soil however my question it was when

473
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,160
I when I read about this is this is this

474
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:32,450
really true is this really true for all

475
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:35,870
exudates that are being excluded because

476
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:38,630
really so their roots exudes a very wide

477
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:40,429
variety of chemicals and really the

478
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,120
majority of those chemicals we haven't

479
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:46,279
even identified yet so that's that's

480
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,229
where we start we don't even know the

481
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,299
variety of chemicals that that is being

482
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,799
exerted and then we also don't know what

483
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:53,480
these they're how these different

484
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,669
chemicals would affect the soil

485
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,269
microbial community so we don't know

486
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,009
that either

487
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:00,440
and then really we also don't really

488
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:03,049
know what what would happen if we see no

489
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,420
change at all an increase or decrease in

490
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:07,779
soil organic matter decomposition and if

491
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,130
you if you read Studies on word priming

492
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:11,388
that have been done with different plant

493
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,749
species you indeed buy

494
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:16,519
that sometimes slow microbial

495
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,379
respiration is increased sometimes it's

496
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:20,690
decreased sometimes there's no effect at

497
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:23,658
all so we're missing out on a full

498
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,519
explanation of the mechanisms that's

499
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:30,979
play a role in this root priming

500
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:34,489
phenomena and so one of the reasons why

501
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:36,558
I think is just hypothesis that I just

502
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:39,259
explained or just food resource

503
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,868
hypothesis of label label compounds got

504
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:44,269
so much support is because when he's

505
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:46,458
experiment when they're experiments were

506
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,338
designed to study this phenomenon in the

507
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:51,889
lab and mostly glucose was used as a

508
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:54,078
proxy for route excitation so it is very

509
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:57,069
like simple simple soil incubations

510
00:22:54,078 --> 00:23:00,348
where either artificial roots were

511
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:04,009
created as you can like as an example I

512
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:06,528
give you on the slide or just compounds

513
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:09,558
were added by pipetting them into the

514
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:12,739
soil and then the effect of glucose on

515
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,509
so carbon cycling which measured

516
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:16,639
however like I've already been

517
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:18,440
emphasizing roots exude a lot of

518
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:20,298
different compounds and one really large

519
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,999
group of compounds that has been largely

520
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:26,388
ignored in these crude priming studies

521
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:28,519
are secondary metabolites and so

522
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:31,028
secondary metabolites are expected to

523
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:35,028
show a higher variation across species

524
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:37,700
but also the group of compounds that I

525
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:39,769
thought was important to study have been

526
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,078
studying in soils and has been shown to

527
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:43,638
to have different functions so not just

528
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:47,719
a food source but they can in certain

529
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:49,878
cases be toxic it can decrease enzyme

530
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:52,338
activities or inhibit enzyme activities

531
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:55,788
and they play a role in plant microbe

532
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:57,708
signaling and they can mobilize other

533
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:59,929
resources that might have been

534
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:01,609
immobilized in the soil so there's

535
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,259
there's a lot of other functions that

536
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:09,098
could be or a lot of other mechanisms

537
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:11,929
that could be playing a role here so I

538
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:13,729
designed two experiments to really test

539
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,619
one hypothesis which was that root

540
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:17,690
phenolic compounds to has function as a

541
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:21,759
microbial food source but influence so

542
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,759
carbon cycling through other mechanisms

543
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,940
and so the first experiment that I

544
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:31,039
designed started with identifying the

545
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,259
exudates of six different tree species

546
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,359
because if I didn't even know which

547
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:38,680
phenolic compounds were exuded and how

548
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:44,109
could I test their effect on on

549
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:47,750
rhizosphere biogeochemistry and so I a

550
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:50,299
grew tree species in the greenhouse on

551
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,670
their in us in a medium that didn't

552
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:54,200
contain any organic matter and then I

553
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,610
transferred them to hydroponics and

554
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,220
eventually that I measured their

555
00:24:55,609 --> 00:25:01,000
exudates by putting them in individual

556
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,259
jars and with cellulose acetate strips I

557
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,130
sampled the phenolic from that solution

558
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:09,140
and for this part of my experiment I

559
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,130
want to thank Andre Kessler with whom I

560
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:15,170
collaborated a lot and I wasn't it was a

561
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,760
struggle in the beginning to find a

562
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,470
method that was working to work with

563
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,900
these fanatics and I'd also like to

564
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:26,500
thank the rest of his lab for helping

565
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:28,790
with HPLC analysis so then after after I

566
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,609
identified these compounds the next step

567
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,889
was to to test a subset of these on on

568
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:36,709
soil microbial respiration so I'd have

569
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,380
my control soil and then similar to what

570
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,210
other incubation studies that we're

571
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,400
looking at root priming or priming have

572
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,640
done I added different phenolic

573
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,250
compounds to the soil and then measured

574
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:55,559
so microbial respiration using potassium

575
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:57,419
hydroxide traps yeah so

576
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,230
measuring read exudate I would say this

577
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:04,169
was really struggle of my PhD it's it's

578
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,548
very challenging to measure them you

579
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:08,940
you're working with very small

580
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:12,778
concentrations and I actually started

581
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,669
with try I got my first idea was to

582
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:17,429
measure root X addition even in the

583
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:19,740
forests in Germany then I brought it to

584
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:24,139
a smaller scale outside I'm still

585
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:27,419
growing the roots in a potted medium and

586
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:29,189
try to excavate parts of the root system

587
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,869
and like put them in tubes and try to

588
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,999
catch through exudate but none of this

589
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:36,648
none of this was working and that's how

590
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:39,298
in the end I ended up in the greenhouse

591
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:41,638
with a hydroponic system but as you can

592
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:45,839
see I Luca I look quite happy so it

593
00:26:41,638 --> 00:26:49,740
worked out in here so yeah so with this

594
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,778
with this method I identified 181 unique

595
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,628
root exudates that belong to nine

596
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:57,868
different bio synthetic classes and but

597
00:26:54,628 --> 00:27:00,028
out of these 181 exudates I only found

598
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:02,699
five matches with standards that I use

599
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:05,308
so it just demonstrates their lead a big

600
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:09,090
diversity of chemicals that we haven't

601
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:11,579
identified yet however I was able to for

602
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:13,378
most chemicals put them into a bio

603
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:15,599
synthetic or a sign a bio synthetic

604
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:19,618
class to them so we did have some extra

605
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:23,428
information and then I I wanted to

606
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:28,109
answer this question of how unique the

607
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:30,059
these phenolic profiles were were among

608
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:33,839
species so how species specific they

609
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:35,128
were so I used an NM d s analysis for

610
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,658
that and so the way that you can

611
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:38,490
interpret this flood is that points that

612
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,929
are closer together are more similar and

613
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:45,298
points data points that are further

614
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:47,669
apart are are more dissimilar and so I

615
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:51,749
tested six different tree species here

616
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:54,929
and as you can see a cluster quite

617
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:57,720
tightly together meaning that this

618
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:59,909
phenolic profiles were very unique to

619
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,100
that species however we also see some

620
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:04,100
overlap in the case of oak and beech

621
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:14,220
and so then out of those other I try to

622
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,740
test a subset of these phenolic

623
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,900
compounds and tested their effect on

624
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,480
soil microbial respiration and I try to

625
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,400
choose compounds that belong to the

626
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,339
different chemical classes that I had

627
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,679
identified and so here you see those

628
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,629
chemicals on the x-axis and then the

629
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,360
amount of co2 that was respired over

630
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,700
five-day periods and I included glucose

631
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,629
as a positive control and then you see

632
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,058
the control that didn't receive any

633
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:46,409
phenolic addition in the middle in dark

634
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:49,678
blue and so what I want you to take away

635
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,450
from this graph is dead you can see that

636
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,059
phenolic compounds can both increase

637
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,220
decrease or have no effect on soil

638
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:59,009
microbial respiration so this goes

639
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,500
already against these most common

640
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:03,058
hypotheses common hypothesis or common

641
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:08,250
mechanism that has been proposed to

642
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:10,918
explain root priming then an additional

643
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,630
thing that that I found was very

644
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,759
interesting when looking at these result

645
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,890
is that it seems that the biosynthetic

646
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,200
class that the compound belongs to is

647
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,929
not determining whether this compound is

648
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,019
going to have a negative a positive or

649
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:27,150
no effect on respiration as you can see

650
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,389
there's three flavonoid compounds in

651
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:32,460
this graph and there they can narrow in

652
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,650
Jenin is increasing respiration or

653
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,298
saxophone and and cadogan are decreasing

654
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,769
respiration and then additionally if you

655
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:42,538
look at the compounds that suppress

656
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,908
respiration so those are the ones in red

657
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:48,808
they did they all share the same

658
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:50,820
functional group category and so this

659
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:52,950
supports the hypothesis that made a

660
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:54,569
functional group of the compounds is

661
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,548
more important in determining the

662
00:29:54,569 --> 00:30:00,019
compounds effect on soil microbial

663
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:03,779
respiration than the biosynthetic class

664
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:06,298
and so for my next study I want you to

665
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:08,158
remember these three compounds so

666
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:10,259
benzoic acid that's increased

667
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,990
respiration and then caffeic acid and

668
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:15,779
catechin that decreased respiration

669
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:19,279
because I will I I'm gonna further study

670
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:19,279
them in my next experiment

671
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:24,960
so for all from from this first

672
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:28,030
experiment I can conclude that roots

673
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,410
exude a large variety of phenolic

674
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,389
compound and that these phenolic

675
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,120
profiles are quite unique to one species

676
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,580
and that these compounds can result in a

677
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,659
variety of effects on soil microbial

678
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:43,029
respiration however they're also still a

679
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,950
lot of unknowns are some unknowns that I

680
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,690
was specifically interested in and the

681
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,269
first was well okay so we have this

682
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:52,000
total flux of co2 coming from the system

683
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:54,579
but what part of this flux is coming or

684
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,190
what which part of this carbon is coming

685
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:59,048
from the exudate or which carbon which

686
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,058
part of the carbon came from from the

687
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:02,980
soil

688
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:05,859
then also I still don't know really how

689
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,079
these microbials responded to to the

690
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:09,909
exudates that were added and so what the

691
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,808
mechanism really was by which they

692
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:18,548
degraded more or less soil carbon and

693
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:20,918
then lastly and this is this is just in

694
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:22,750
general a problem with with studying the

695
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,400
effect of root exudates in the way that

696
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,589
I did and that other studies did is that

697
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,220
we're always just adding one compounds

698
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:32,798
to the soil well roots exudes so many

699
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,110
compounds at the same time so whether

700
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,240
the individual fact of one root exudate

701
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:39,519
is gonna be the same when there's a

702
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:45,759
bunch of compounds added it's also still

703
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:48,519
an open question so for this second

704
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,190
experiment I I collaborated with a lot

705
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,929
of people to answer these these

706
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,140
remaining questions and I first want to

707
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:57,548
thank Quanah munos okis if it hadn't

708
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,429
been for her I would have included a

709
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:03,220
sequencing component into this study so

710
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:06,070
thank you for all your help and support

711
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,890
and I also want to thank jet sparks

712
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:11,619
which helped me a lot with figuring out

713
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,720
the methods to measure to use stable

714
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:16,629
isotope analysis to distinguish between

715
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,150
the soil and exudate source of carbon

716
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,970
and I also want to thank Kim sparks and

717
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,669
just coil in general then I also want to

718
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,860
thank guy awakens' who helped me with

719
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:29,440
the design of the experiment enzyme

720
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:31,089
analysis microbial biomass I also want

721
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,690
to thank his graduate student Natalie

722
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:34,398
Bray because she was the

723
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,038
who teach me or showed me how to use

724
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,839
them COC machine so thanks a lot for

725
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,089
that and then lastly I want to thank

726
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:44,058
Rollie who Roland will him from the

727
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:46,368
Bucky lab who helped further supported

728
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:52,428
me in Kelowna with the sequencing part

729
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:55,278
of the study all right so this soil

730
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,690
exudate incubation was similar to the

731
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,358
incubation that I did in the previous

732
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,609
study only did this incubation took

733
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:05,898
longer so I was 38 days in total and

734
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:07,759
then I used 13c labeled compound so that

735
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:09,469
I was able to distinguish between carbon

736
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,249
coming from soil and carbon coming from

737
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,950
the exudates

738
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:15,108
and I used two different methods to

739
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,889
measure soil respiration I still use my

740
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:20,538
koh or Koh traps to get an estimate of

741
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:23,089
the total amount or cumulative amount

742
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:26,538
carbon respired over the course of the

743
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:28,848
experiment but I also on several days

744
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:30,440
from day one day to day five day 15 and

745
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:34,069
the last day of the experiment

746
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,499
I also took to our interval gas samples

747
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:39,229
and then through using healing plots I

748
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:41,358
could estimate the Delta 13c signature

749
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:47,479
of the source of carbon being respired

750
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:49,579
and then also to get more this microbial

751
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:51,409
mechanism that was that was could maybe

752
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:53,329
explain part of these patterns that we

753
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:56,269
were seeing I stick with destructive

754
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:59,089
samples on day 5 day 15 and at the end

755
00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:00,858
for the enzyme analysis for microbial

756
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:04,069
biomass microbial abundance and and also

757
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:06,918
for sequencing part or to cook microbial

758
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,778
community analysis of the study I and

759
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:12,349
then a last thing that that I want to

760
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:14,239
mention about or that was different from

761
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,490
the last study is that I introduced

762
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,439
glucose into the story and I chose

763
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:21,949
glucose because that's the compound that

764
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:25,398
has been mowed wisely study and I wanted

765
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:27,618
to see if its effect would be the same

766
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,568
when a compound and phenolic compound

767
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:31,548
was added at the same time that already

768
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:34,128
showed has these different effects and

769
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:35,599
so microbial respiration and so I had

770
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:37,969
treatments where I added just a phenolic

771
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,220
and the glucose or I added the phenolic

772
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:41,689
and glucose together and in the cases

773
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:43,519
where there was just a single compound

774
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,200
dose were so different no leak was

775
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,489
labeled or the glucose was labeled but

776
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,849
indicates very added

777
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:55,368
compounds the glucose was labeled so I

778
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:57,019
couldn't I didn't have a way well so I

779
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:58,190
could distinguish between the carbon

780
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:00,650
coming from the glucose and from there

781
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,860
from there look at the soil together I

782
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,470
did estimate the amount of carbon that

783
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,869
came from the soil by subtracting the

784
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:15,469
amount of phenolic compound degraded in

785
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:17,360
the individual treatments all right so

786
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:19,189
here are the chemicals that I already

787
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,050
introduced from our previous study so I

788
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:25,670
tested the effect of benzoic acid

789
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:29,570
caffeic acid and cadogan at a high and a

790
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:31,849
low dose then glucose and so then I

791
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,460
ended up with 14 treatments in total and

792
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:36,110
then with destructive samples that I was

793
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,150
taking at these different time points I

794
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:44,269
ended up with a lot of charts in a

795
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,950
growth chamber gurmann and so yeah a lot

796
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:48,530
of jars and also a lot of results so

797
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:50,419
that's a good thing but for the sake of

798
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,130
this talk I'm going to focus on these

799
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,670
three points that I already mentioned

800
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,490
that I was interested in learning more

801
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:03,530
about and if you want to learn even more

802
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:09,919
about it then maybe tomorrow all right

803
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:11,359
so this first question of where where to

804
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,389
what extent are these root exudates

805
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,969
actually degraded and so I'm showing you

806
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:18,650
a graph here of the degradation of the

807
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:21,230
individual treatments and individual

808
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:29,900
compounds over the first 15 days of the

809
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:31,490
experiment and so you can see first

810
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,340
let's look at glucose so that's the

811
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:37,159
black line and so you can see that on

812
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,140
day one it's it's almost it's it's the

813
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,909
greatest to the highest degree and then

814
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:44,089
it already Crary quickly drops and by

815
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:47,389
day 15 it's it's similar to the it's not

816
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:51,079
being degraded much anymore and and then

817
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:53,980
for benzoic acid we do see some

818
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,900
degradation it's just a little slower

819
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:00,260
but this just goes this goes against my

820
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:03,800
hypothesis that these phenolic aren't

821
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,450
rated at all so they are utilized but

822
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,240
then if you look at caffeic acid and

823
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:10,489
Cadogan they are almost not degraded or

824
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:14,959
not degraded and so that is in line with

825
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:18,679
what I with what I have both says then

826
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,510
if we look at the amount of carbon that

827
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:24,829
is respired from the soil so this is

828
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:27,470
over 238 days of the experiments we see

829
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:31,929
that only so the control here is in grey

830
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:34,368
and we see that only glucose increases

831
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:37,039
decomposition so organic matter

832
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:41,630
decomposition and benzoic acid at the

833
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:44,599
high dose and so because I only picked

834
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,519
up on this effect for or a difference in

835
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,469
soil organic matter decomposition for

836
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:52,759
benzoic acid and glucose I'm going to

837
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:56,179
show you a graph of just those two

838
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,850
treatments so this is the same as what I

839
00:37:56,179 --> 00:38:00,440
showed you in the previous graph but

840
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:03,289
then what I was interested in is this

841
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,490
interactive effect of benzoic acid and

842
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:09,500
glucose on the breakdown carbon and so

843
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:13,939
what we see is that when they're added

844
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:16,550
together the amount of so organic matter

845
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,670
that is decomposed is decreased as

846
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:22,730
increased and this is actually more than

847
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:28,159
if you would just add the their effects

848
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:32,150
of the individual treatments and we can

849
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:35,779
use enzyme analysis to get a better idea

850
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:39,050
of what kind of carbon sources were

851
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,590
degraded and so I found no difference in

852
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:45,609
phenol oxidase or peroxidase activity

853
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:48,980
but I did find a big increase in in

854
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:51,079
embedded glucose today's activity in the

855
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,240
benzoic acid treatments and in the Bozo

856
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,279
benzoic acid and glucose treatments it

857
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:58,368
suggests that the carbon sources that

858
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:03,580
were utilized were on the more label

859
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:03,579
side and not very complex or aromatic

860
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:11,000
and so then

861
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:12,650
then my girl Buell mechanisms that I was

862
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,929
interested in studying I just wanted to

863
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,360
quickly elaborate on that before moving

864
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:19,879
into the results so the question that I

865
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,130
was interested in is to what extent a

866
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,430
change in microbial respiration is

867
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:29,030
linked to an increase or decrease in

868
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:31,849
microbial abundance or microbial

869
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:34,970
community or both so you can imagine

870
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:37,549
your control we're know from the only

871
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:39,709
compound is edit and then if you do add

872
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,740
a phenolic compounds but we don't see

873
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,889
and a change in abundance and we don't

874
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:47,779
see a change in the community then maybe

875
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:50,210
the mechanism involved is triggering

876
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,160
mechanism so the metabolism of the

877
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,929
microbes that are living in that soil is

878
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,299
triggered and that's the reason why we

879
00:39:53,929 --> 00:40:00,019
see in this case I'm using an increase

880
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:03,289
in in respiration as my example but you

881
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:05,500
could argue it's you could argue the

882
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:09,469
same thing for a decrease in respiration

883
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:12,050
or if we don't see a change in the

884
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:12,859
community but we do see a change in

885
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,400
abundance

886
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:20,480
then maybe it's this increase in

887
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:24,380
microbial biomass that's that is linked

888
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,059
with this increase in respiration or if

889
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,849
we don't see a craze in abundance but we

890
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:31,429
do see an increase in a do see a shift

891
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:33,259
in the community then maybe it's this

892
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,929
change the community that is linked to

893
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:40,910
to a change in respiration so community

894
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:42,799
that is may be more actively degrading

895
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:45,049
carbon resources or even maybe a

896
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,160
community that it consists of more

897
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:51,890
degraders

898
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:54,559
soy organic carbons so start miss

899
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:56,480
showing you a graph of microbial

900
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,699
abundance as affected by the different

901
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,070
phenolic treatments and so we have

902
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:03,139
benzoic acid caffeic acid and catechin

903
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:06,350
and the control and we see that even

904
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:09,500
though benzoic acid increased microbial

905
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:13,069
respiration overall and it's its

906
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,420
abundance is not increased and then if

907
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,240
we

908
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,860
caffeic acid in Cadogan and we do see a

909
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,389
decrease in abundance and these

910
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,740
treatments were also the one that we're

911
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:22,900
showing more of a decrease in

912
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:25,389
respiration so maybe in this case

913
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,490
abundance could explain part of this

914
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:37,839
story but not in the case of benzoic

915
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:41,469
acid and so here are my microbial

916
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,360
community results and so this is similar

917
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:47,739
plot that I showed as to the one with

918
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,809
the root exudates variation among three

919
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:51,609
species so again like points that are

920
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:53,529
closer together are more similar and

921
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,650
then points that are further apart or

922
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:58,720
more are more difference and well the

923
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:03,639
first thing that so these are samples

924
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:04,989
taking a day by day 0-5 1538 so the

925
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,879
first thing that stand out is that the

926
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:10,329
microbial community changed over time

927
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,650
cuz we see this you see this shift with

928
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:17,469
the days our days are grouped together

929
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:18,789
but then the thing that that I was more

930
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:20,529
interested in seeing is what these

931
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:22,750
phenolic compounds were doing to the

932
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,790
community and so you can see the benzoic

933
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,309
acid so those are the data points in

934
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:30,489
blue are very far shifted away from the

935
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:32,440
control that is in gray though if you

936
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:35,739
look at glucose which is in black it's

937
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,849
very closely grouped together to this

938
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:41,769
control especially on on day five so

939
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,989
this suggests that even though glucose

940
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:46,300
and benzoic acid were both increasing

941
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,929
respiration that may be the mechanism by

942
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:52,720
which it did this was different

943
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:56,619
and so furred so overall like these two

944
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,879
graphs it's I've already tested the

945
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,069
effect of phenolic compounds on

946
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,880
abundance and on the microbial community

947
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:06,160
but we can further test this by using

948
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,930
Spearman correlations and the the unit

949
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,179
that I used here for the shift in

950
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:13,239
microbial community is that I calculated

951
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:16,269
the distance from these individual data

952
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:18,339
points to the control so that is kind of

953
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:22,750
my measure for the shift income in the

954
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,190
community that took place and so then we

955
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,789
find

956
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:29,190
if you look at a graph a dead there was

957
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:31,440
a significant correlation between the

958
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,710
shift in the community and the change in

959
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,800
microbial respiration well if we look at

960
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,139
the second graph graph bead and we do

961
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:48,720
not see a correlation between microbial

962
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:52,829
abundance and microbial respiration and

963
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:54,719
so then the next question was okay so we

964
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,920
see a shift in the community but what is

965
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:01,409
really changing or who is changing and

966
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,659
we found that in the benzoic acid

967
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:05,549
treatment the Burkholder Ian parable

968
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:07,409
called the Rhea general which

969
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,730
ecologically are kind of still treated

970
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:10,500
as the same genus even though

971
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:13,860
phylogenetically they have been

972
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,860
separated recently the day were the ones

973
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,800
that showed the greatest increase in in

974
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:23,640
abundance under the under the benzoic

975
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,920
acid treatment and this these genera are

976
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,469
known to be prevalent in forest soils

977
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,039
which was the soil that i used for both

978
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:34,980
incubation studies and they're also

979
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,079
known to be able to the great phenolic

980
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:40,139
s' quite efficiently and also be able to

981
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,569
tolerate their toxicity and at the same

982
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,849
time they also play a role in soil

983
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:48,300
organic matter decomposition so then we

984
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:51,329
can start seeing that this mechanism

985
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,900
that maybe with the addition of benzoic

986
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:58,349
acid we selected for micro microbial

987
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,970
genera that it could tolerate that could

988
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:02,039
degrade these compounds that could color

989
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:04,859
aids potential toxicity but that were

990
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:13,289
also quite efficient at breaking down as

991
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:17,690
organic matter so even though benzoic

992
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:22,900
acid also was used as a food source and

993
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:24,639
also increased respiration I think that

994
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,588
that the mechanism by which it was done

995
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,929
was different maybe it caused a change

996
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:33,210
in the microbial community and that was

997
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:39,098
what was more linked to this change in

998
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:42,519
respiration so then to bring it back to

999
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:45,220
my overall hypothesis that I was testing

1000
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,108
in these two experiments so is it our

1001
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:49,838
phenolic is used as a microbial food

1002
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:52,690
source well yes in the case of benzoic

1003
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:56,230
acid no in the case of of Cadogan and

1004
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:59,289
caffeic acid or to a lesser degree but

1005
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:03,068
the mechanism by which this food source

1006
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:04,660
was in the end causing also a change in

1007
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:06,190
organic matter decomposition was

1008
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:09,368
different it was it was changing the

1009
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:11,650
community and so other phenolic

1010
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:13,539
mechanisms that may be I that I found

1011
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,970
some evidence for were toxicity in the

1012
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:19,990
case of acid in cadogan's we saw this

1013
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:23,048
decrease in the in abundance and there

1014
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:25,149
there's other mechanisms that I did that

1015
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:28,599
my results don't exclude but that we

1016
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:33,608
would need further evidence for to to to

1017
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:36,460
support them so that brings me to the

1018
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:39,759
end of my talk so I shared my results

1019
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,690
today one about the responses of fine

1020
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,940
roots to droughts and then secondly the

1021
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,429
mechanisms by which root exudates can

1022
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,710
influence organic matter decomposition

1023
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:52,929
and so I answered some questions but

1024
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,778
there's still a lot of remaining

1025
00:46:52,929 --> 00:47:00,068
questions it's a very complex system to

1026
00:46:55,778 --> 00:47:02,349
study but I hope that you agree with me

1027
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:06,849
that answering these remaining questions

1028
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:09,490
is is worth the struggle and so with

1029
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:12,579
that I want to thank many people first

1030
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:15,699
of all my major adviser Darren barley

1031
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:18,250
thanks so much for all your support

1032
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:20,739
I've really yeah pretty enjoyed working

1033
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:22,568
with you and very much appreciated the

1034
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:25,689
freedom and confidence and tools you

1035
00:47:22,568 --> 00:47:28,239
gave me to develop my dissertation

1036
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,400
project so thanks so much that I'd also

1037
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,969
like to thank the rest of my committee

1038
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,430
team Andre Jed and Kyle it's been really

1039
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:38,828
a pleasure to work with all of you and

1040
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:43,328
yeah I've learned a lot from you and I'm

1041
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:46,240
very grateful for discussing my results

1042
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:48,309
with you and manuscript revisions help

1043
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,399
with research methods so thank you so

1044
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:54,130
much um okay I'm just gonna keep them

1045
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,440
going I would like to thank all the

1046
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:59,200
members of the bar early laughs Quanah

1047
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,088
was also a collaborator and Annika and

1048
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:04,239
for the undergraduates that helped me

1049
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:06,788
last animations as well also like to

1050
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:10,000
thank my other collaborators mark kobold

1051
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:13,900
Orson grams and Fritz that were involved

1052
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,559
in the Germany study and enrollee then

1053
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:20,740
also Cornell's just great for it's so

1054
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:23,079
many facilities and the technical help

1055
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:25,629
and support that analytical support I've

1056
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:28,750
received has just been amazing everyone

1057
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:30,880
there and uh just wider sips community

1058
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,960
Johannes my master's advisors and

1059
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,940
surgeon who i t-84 for many years and

1060
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:40,539
Soho and a horticulture staff and also

1061
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:43,420
my funding sources and lastly my family

1062
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:45,369
and friends have been yeah just

1063
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,809
wonderful and I really don't know how I

1064
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:48,970
would have done it without all of you

1065
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:50,980
especially my friends here in Ithaca and

1066
00:48:48,969 --> 00:49:22,019
my boyfriend's who is now with me and

1067
00:48:50,980 --> 00:49:29,889
friends so yeah resource use efficiency

1068
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:33,028
compliment yeah I guess you didn't

1069
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:38,548
measure know if you have some

1070
00:49:33,028 --> 00:49:42,210
measurements that really did the

1071
00:49:38,548 --> 00:49:45,929
complementarity did not decrease you to

1072
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:48,300
obtaining and did indeed also increase

1073
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:51,179
growth above ground

1074
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,130
yes so other collaborators that were

1075
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:56,339
that are part of this study are

1076
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:01,740
measuring the above-ground above-ground

1077
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:04,490
parameters and well we found that

1078
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:08,069
drought is decreasing in carbon uptake

1079
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:11,609
and in terms of the complementary part

1080
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,680
they haven't found well they haven't

1081
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:16,650
published their results yet and their

1082
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:20,210
results aren't super convincing but

1083
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:23,700
there are some in there are some

1084
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:25,289
increases or increases it seems like it

1085
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:28,579
is the effect of drought is slightly

1086
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:32,009
mitigated but it isn't super convincing

1087
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:33,690
yeah and they have there there's other

1088
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:36,150
part of the study is that there is this

1089
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:38,519
so there's this one big controlled

1090
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:41,430
fruitful exclusion site and then there's

1091
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:44,309
also a larger gradient of precipitation

1092
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:45,869
gradient where they're looking at smell

1093
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,579
mainly above ground parameters as well

1094
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:50,519
and in some of these studies they have

1095
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,929
found this complimentary effects above

1096
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,190
ground but not at the Crown's Burgh

1097
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:55,190
sites where I was working

1098
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:12,870
yeah I think so yeah due to these mixed

1099
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:18,590
systems yeah maybe I guess let's hope

1100
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:24,199
they find that find anything mixtures

1101
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:27,150
peach mixture studies yeah Devon those

1102
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:32,089
have those long consistent mixture of X

1103
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:34,530
and not not completely not completely

1104
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,660
consistent but there are studies that

1105
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:39,300
show that there is a complementary

1106
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:50,699
effect and that there is greater growth

1107
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:55,160
yeah so this was a few meters so like

1108
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:55,159
maybe 2 3 meters yeah

1109
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:08,308
or how entry modifiers anatomically

1110
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,308
those five routes

1111
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:26,289
hmm no no I don't know I don't I don't

1112
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:27,969
know yeah that's I guess I can old as I

1113
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:30,670
can say they try to maintain the route

1114
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:32,259
for a longer but because it's like it's

1115
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:35,920
kind of this question of are you gonna

1116
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:37,539
are you gonna use are you gonna shed

1117
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,159
your route or are you just are you going

1118
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:42,640
to maintain it for longer and just keep

1119
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,108
on sending resources its way but if

1120
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,998
there is something anatomically that

1121
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:47,708
changes so that you have like a super

1122
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:57,848
route that can leave a little longer I

1123
00:52:47,708 --> 00:53:01,598
don't know genetics results on carbon

1124
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:05,109
pollution yeah so alex has a result in

1125
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,670
terms of the lifespan harder yeah so he

1126
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:11,380
he found the relationship between

1127
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:13,088
lifespan and respiration so that I think

1128
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:29,798
the breeze was longer lifespan had lower

1129
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:31,900
respiration rates yeah so alright this

1130
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:37,679
has been a production of Cornell

1131
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:37,679
