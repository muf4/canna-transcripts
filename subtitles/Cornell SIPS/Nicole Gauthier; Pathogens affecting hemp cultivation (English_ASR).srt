from uh last week so with that Nicole

54
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,280
it's all yours hello thank you so much

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,959
um hello everyone uh it's great to be

56
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,919
here um today we're talking about uh

57
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,479
plant diseases as as Lucia said but I'm

58
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,719
GNA focus on grain hemp today um anybody

59
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,158
who knows me has heard any of my talks

60
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,318
you never know what I'm going to talk

61
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,598
about usually it's disease in general

62
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,919
but today we're going to focus on grain

63
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,000
hemp and again I am from the University

64
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,199
of Kentucky most of my work happens in

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Kentucky so this is more of a Kentucky

66
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,318
perspective if you are not from Kentucky

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,799
or in a nearby State you should be

68
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,639
communicating with your extension

69
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,280
Educators or extension specialists in

70
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,839
your state to assure that we've got the

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,959
same diseases and we've got the same

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,840
management

73
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,878
recommendations climates are different

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,878
planting times are different and even

75
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,359
disease distribution is different so

76
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:35,719
again I'm

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:40,319
Midwest um uh located but most of this

78
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:42,759
should apply to everyone here okay we

79
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,399
cannot start a disease talk of grain

80
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:49,158
hemp without talking about diseases in

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,519
general um Cannabis sativa is him

82
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:55,519
Cannabis sativa is marijuana Cannabis

83
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,879
sativa is the plant that we're talking

84
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,640
about today so the common diseases of

85
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:06,199
hemp or grain hemp are the generally the

86
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:11,399
same ones that we see in all Cannabis

87
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:14,719
sativa um so we see a range of diseases

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,519
from damping off root rots and Crown

89
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,600
rots right so our root rots can range

90
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,360
from those damping off sealing diseases

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,840
to something larger Crown rots from

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,680
Southern blight which I know is all the

93
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:33,478
way in the northeastern us and even into

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,840
Canada vascular wilts we all know

95
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,879
fusarium Wilt is probably the most

96
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:42,119
talked about of the vascular wilts in

97
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,439
hemp and in cannabis but we don't see

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,759
that many we see surprisingly fewer than

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,519
uh the literature would uh make us think

100
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,520
um here in Kentucky we have not U

101
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,000
fusarium oxysporum but we have found

102
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,758
other species of fusaria causing a

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,800
vascular Wilt which is unusual but again

104
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,038
not a lot of vascular Wilt in the grand

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,240
scheme of

106
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,199
things Leaf spots and blights so a leaf

107
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,120
spot is what you see on the screen a

108
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,400
spot whereas a leaf blight is kind of

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,439
that quick death where you see that

110
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,679
whole Leaf die and it dies really

111
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,719
quickly we see lots of leaf spots and

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,199
blights and uh human nature that's just

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,000
what we tend to zero in on so we talk a

114
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,160
lot about Leaf spots and leaf blights we

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,720
um in fact a little bit of a side note

116
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,759
uh we did some research here at the

117
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,440
University of Kentucky looking at um

118
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,879
various U cultivars of hemp and

119
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,800
different Leaf spotting diseases and we

120
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,918
found that regardless of how severe

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,560
those leaf spot diseases get we did not

122
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:50,478
see an effect on biomass yield or canabo

123
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,399
yield so um of course that was a

124
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,120
two-year study in Kentucky so maybe

125
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,279
there's a lot more to talk about or not

126
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,680
so uh but I'm not talking about Leaf

127
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,879
spots today per se all right so mildew

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,400
and molds we all know powdery mildew and

129
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,839
Downey mildew and betrus gry mold um

130
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,879
those are more like pollinizers of a

131
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,079
leaf we don't call those Leaf spots per

132
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:19,038
se but they are Leaf diseases they're

133
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:21,959
everywhere they can infect um cannaboid

134
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:25,439
grain or Fiber

135
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,159
cannabis grain diseases and now I'm

136
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,959
talking specifically so when we go

137
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,919
beyond that flower if we have a

138
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,279
pollinated flour we have grain that stay

139
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,279
on the plant longer and so grain

140
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,679
diseases that is what I'm talking about

141
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,638
today and then of course um and in

142
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,560
particular I'm going to talk about

143
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,720
fusarium headlight today not as much the

144
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,079
betrus we just don't have that much

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,319
betrus grey mold here in Kentucky it's

146
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:56,318
too hot um I know that in Geneva and in

147
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
the northern climates you'll see more of

148
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,759
that but when I'm talking grain diseases

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,038
I'll be talking primarily about fusarium

150
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,680
headlight and uh storage molds because

151
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,439
anything that moves from the field into

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,160
storage moves from the field to storage

153
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,360
so sometimes it matters and there are

154
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,560
cases where it

155
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,280
does but my assignment today is to talk

156
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,639
about common diseases of grain hemp so

157
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,839
in this whole list of diseases that I

158
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,199
love to talk about everyone we're going

159
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,918
to focus on damping off and we're going

160
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,038
to talk about those flowering grain

161
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:36,758
diseases mostly one of them because

162
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:40,159
those are the big those are the big um

163
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,560
limiting factors for grain hemp so grain

164
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
hemp is planted differently we don't uh

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,000
we don't transplant into the greenhouse

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,439
we go into the field we grow it fast we

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,680
get it out fast uh we plant it very

168
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,839
closely so it's more of an agronomic

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,439
type crop so we're Limited in the number

170
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,239
of diseases we're going to talk about

171
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,519
today not that any of those others won't

172
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
matter but these are the big red flags

173
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,680
for me here in

174
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,918
Kentucky and these are major concerns

175
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,800
for our Growers so these are the ones if

176
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,079
I was invited to a grower talk these are

177
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,720
the ones that I would be talking

178
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:19,719
about so let's start with damping off

179
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,360
what the heck is damping off that is

180
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,199
well pre-emergent disease or

181
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,280
post-emergent that can affect seeds or

182
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,879
seedlings so that's what we mean by

183
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,958
damping off

184
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,599
pre-emergent damping off is when a seed

185
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:40,359
fails to germinate fails to emerge or

186
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,320
fails to develop so pre-emergent before

187
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,560
that seed emerges per se um we've also

188
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,839
got so it'll die after germination or

189
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,799
right before

190
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,200
germination um pathogens can affect any

191
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,559
part of the seed or seedling right so

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,640
post emergent damping off is after that

193
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,639
seed emerges that could be that ceiling

194
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,000
stage or less there's a lot of gray area

195
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,838
between what's pre-emergent what's

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,200
post-emergent right don't overthink it

197
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,959
uh we are talking specifically about an

198
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,600
early infection of a seed or seedling by

199
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:18,078
a soilborne pathogen that's generally

200
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,920
the definition so um here we've got a

201
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:23,278
seed a seed that's just germinating

202
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:27,639
trying to germinate and disease coming

203
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,958
in and in the center we have um we have

204
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,559
a pathogen that has infected that uh

205
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,759
seedling and then the seedling collapses

206
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,000
and all the way on the right well now

207
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,559
we're questioning whether that's a

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,679
Seedling at all so it's a young plant

209
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,518
it's been infected it's been affected

210
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,159
and if you want to call that a sealing

211
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,320
disease that's okay and we're not going

212
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,879
to get caught up in the minutia point is

213
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,959
we have early season disease very early

214
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,278
season

215
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,518
disease uh generally these plant

216
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,679
pathogens like wet environments and

217
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
that's a lot of times what we're doing

218
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,559
in the greenhouse if we're producing

219
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,759
transplants or if we plant early in the

220
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,239
season in the field to try to get a jump

221
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,838
start our soils are usually cooler so

222
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,519
that's usually when we see these damping

223
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,200
off

224
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,360
diseases so let's start with probably

225
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,079
the most common of the um of the damping

226
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,360
off diseases and that's pythium root rot

227
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,799
pythium Crown rot pythium damping off or

228
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,519
if you're like me you can just say

229
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,240
pythium because it's all of the above

230
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,120
there are sever veral pythium species

231
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,919
that cause damping off or seedling

232
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,879
diseases if you will um and I I'm not

233
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,599
going to go into them depending on what

234
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,679
the field is what the previous crop is

235
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,879
the pythium aadum we usually see in the

236
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,000
greenhouse it's more of a hot weather

237
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,559
pythium but I can find it in soils here

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,159
in Kentucky and then uh pythium or

239
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,638
globas sporangium irregular and uh

240
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,240
globas sporangium which used to be

241
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,440
called py ultimum um those are very

242
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,519
common they affect a wide range of

243
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,680
different crops um from soybeans to

244
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,039
vegetable

245
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,439
crops generally okay so so let's back up

246
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,439
pythium is a water mold so it's not a

247
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,800
true fungus it is a water mold or an O

248
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,040
and that means they like water they need

249
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,719
water to complete their life cycle and

250
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,199
more water than just dampness so they

251
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,639
need more water and so when we talk

252
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,240
about water moldes that that really isfe

253
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,759
something okay so the image on the left

254
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,839
you'll see like a dip in this field

255
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,360
ultimately in this field in particular

256
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,600
now this is a transplant field this is

257
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
not a grain field but ultimately what

258
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,278
happened is right in the center of that

259
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,639
field in that low area where water stood

260
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,720
we had a um an outbreak of pythium root

261
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,720
rot on those plants and they did not

262
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,720
make it to maturity so low-lying areas

263
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,839
usually more water and if there is um a

264
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,278
pythium or a water mold present it will

265
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,240
be really happy with the situation and

266
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,120
so it can infect more easily complete

267
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,759
its life cycle more easily and then

268
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,278
spread okay so the image on the right

269
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,720
that is a closeup of roots this this was

270
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:21,439
a container but this is closeup of roots

271
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,240
that are infected with aium species so

272
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,240
notice that we've got some nice white

273
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,198
roots with root hairs those are not

274
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,159
infected yet and then those brownish

275
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,000
Gray roots that have lost heridity

276
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,360
they're probably slimy you could

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,679
probably Slough off that cortex that

278
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,199
would be indicative of an infected root

279
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,519
so if you're examining a seed or a

280
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:46,679
Seedling that color change is usually

281
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,600
really distinct you'll dig not pull and

282
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,719
you'll rinse gently and you'll be able

283
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,120
to see if roots are turgid and nice and

284
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,160
white and color or if they have kind of

285
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,278
lesions or dark spots on them or if um

286
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,799
you know sometimes we'll have a crown

287
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,439
rot that might fool us if the roots look

288
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,479
good and the rest of the plant doesn't

289
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,800
we're looking somewhere else but if

290
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,000
there's a root rot you'll be able to see

291
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,919
it I'll tell you something else about

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,399
pythium if anybody wants some nerdy

293
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,759
pathology uh pythium likes to nibble it

294
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:21,879
Roots I told you it rots off kind of it

295
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:24,159
decays that um that cortex so these

296
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,000
images here they both you'll see the

297
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,159
cortex has sloughed off and you'll see

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,919
the steel sticking out so on the left

299
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,879
hand image all the way way at the Top If

300
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,599
you can see my cursor you'll see the

301
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,519
cortex has sloughed off right about here

302
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,440
and everything Beyond it that's just the

303
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,240
steel sticking out so that's usually

304
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,320
indicative of pythium root rot um and

305
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,079
then the image on the right that's

306
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,639
pretty much the same thing and these are

307
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,479
being held upside down so yes I realize

308
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,919
these roots are pointing the wrong way

309
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,159
so

310
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,479
um that's how we hold them right that's

311
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,958
the way our brain works so when I hold

312
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,879
them to photograph that's what it looks

313
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,278
like but you'll see this rat tail

314
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,439
uh root tip right here and there's some

315
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,919
others in these images and that rat tail

316
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,639
root means the steel is sticking out and

317
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,919
the cortex has slept off almost always

318
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,198
epiom so if you want to do some self-

319
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:18,360
diagnosis you need a hand lens or a

320
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,838
magnifying glass and um hopefully not a

321
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,839
rotted

322
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:31,198
root all right our next damping off

323
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,680
pathogen is Fus Arium salani this is not

324
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:37,439
fusarium oxysporum that causes fusarium

325
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:40,479
Wilt this is another fusarium um this is

326
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,600
a true fungus this is not a water bold

327
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,320
and uh fusarium also have wide host

328
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
ranges they like it wet and warm but

329
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,560
they don't like water at the same rate

330
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,360
that our water molds do okay this is a

331
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,000
true fungus it likes

332
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,159
moisture fusarium salani can cause

333
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,559
damping off it could also cause crown

334
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:03,399
and root rots and often the fusarium

335
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:07,078
infection will be as a result of some

336
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,839
wound um I've shown this image in in

337
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,958
before so this so we're not talking

338
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,560
damping off exactly right now this image

339
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,919
is after the fact but this grower had a

340
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,958
plastic hter system the plastic was so

341
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,039
thick and they slit the plastic instead

342
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:26,239
of burning holes so the plastic rubbed

343
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,639
against the the crown so here is a hemp

344
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,759
stem upside down here I go again upside

345
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
down and you'll see this lesion here

346
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,120
you'll see that pink right there that's

347
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,920
usually indicative of a fusarium so

348
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,799
you'll see that wound fusarium got in

349
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,879
and you'll see the discoloration working

350
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:45,719
its way up and working its way down so

351
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,639
this is a crown rot if you will because

352
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,839
it happened at the crown there's also

353
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,799
some root rot going on I didn't show The

354
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,920
Roots here but if you so before I pull

355
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,399
this plant up if you look in the field

356
00:15:54,919 --> 00:16:01,759
that plant is dying and that's because

357
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,198
that Burling canker on that Crown has

358
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,959
affected the the uptake of watering

359
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,639
nutrients to the top of the plant so

360
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,159
that's what's happening there so anytime

361
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,799
a whole plant is going down you're

362
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,639
looking for the common denominator and

363
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:17,159
in this case it was the

364
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,839
crown again fusarium salani causes the

365
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,719
damping off if it's in your Fields if

366
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,040
it's built up in your Fields over the

367
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,079
years um and we do have some of that

368
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,559
actually on our Research Forum then you

369
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,599
will see damping off at plant

370
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,278
and you could also see it affecting

371
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,278
later in the

372
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,439
season almost always associated with

373
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,000
wounds that could be insect wounds that

374
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:47,399
could be mechanical wounds that can be

375
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,198
stress okay and then our third and final

376
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,600
um damping off pathogen is Ry octonia

377
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:57,719
salani we call this one ryok r hi- i zoc

378
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,278
ryok that's our shortcut that's the way

379
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,680
we talk about this one uh this is also a

380
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,880
soil born disease with a very wide Host

381
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:08,318
range rise octonia salani can cause

382
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,640
damping off it can also cause a crown

383
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,000
and root rot and um pretty nerdy for a

384
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,400
plant pathologist is this one can cause

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,078
a web light or an aerial blight let me

386
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,919
say that rise octonia salani also has a

387
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,078
very wide Host range so if it's in the

388
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,919
field if it's built up in numbers if

389
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,599
it's wet uh and warm at the beginning of

390
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,919
the Season except excessively wet not as

391
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,918
wet as an O as a water mold but still

392
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,400
wet um it can start it can come in as a

393
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,080
damping off and if it's a rainy hot

394
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
summer this one loves to move its way up

395
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,558
into the

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,880
canopy the image on the left that is a

397
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:51,038
crown rot so you'll see that Mycelia

398
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,360
that fungal white body that that is on

399
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,879
that crown and the bottom part of that

400
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,038
picture on the left that is like a

401
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,240
crosssection so that is a cut into that

402
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,640
crown and you will see again you see

403
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,759
that uh White Mycelia that white fungal

404
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,799
body there on the right that is web

405
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,200
light and that is when that fungus that

406
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,119
soilborne fungus moves from the soil it

407
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,759
moves up into the canopy this happens

408
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,158
again when it's hot and rainy in the

409
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,519
summertime and when that canopy is so

410
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,200
dense and there's no air circulation so

411
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,200
that's when you'll see that web light so

412
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,360
that Mycelia that white fungal body

413
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,080
moves its way up into the canopy and

414
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,719
it's we leaving its way it's almost

415
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,079
stitching it looks like thread it's

416
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,360
stitching those leaves together and it

417
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,519
looks a lot like a spiderweb but it's

418
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,279
stitched those leaves together so R RIS

419
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:46,400
octonia Salon can cause damping off and

420
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:49,038
it can lead to additional um um later

421
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,159
seasoned diseases and again very wide

422
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,240
Host range so if it's built up in the

423
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,720
field with other crops it will be there

424
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,240
when you come in with your grain hemp or

425
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,519
if you rotate out of hemp and you rotate

426
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,839
into another host plant you have not

427
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,400
broken that disease cycle okay so when

428
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,000
we talk about these host ranges it

429
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,759
matters because as we rotate that's

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,440
where we're going to see um some some

431
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,440
management

432
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,679
options okay now I'm switching to

433
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,200
disease number two I told you I'm only

434
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,880
talking about two diseases today and

435
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,519
this is a fusarium head and budlight so

436
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,240
this is when we get to the flowering and

437
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,558
the grain stage

438
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,640
this has been a big one for us this has

439
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:37,839
been a big one throughout oh Midwest and

440
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,600
um east of the Mississippi River we're

441
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,319
seeing more and more of it as we're

442
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:46,599
growing more hemp um we are on our 10th

443
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:50,000
year of of hemp here in Kentucky we

444
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:53,119
started growing it in 2014 on that 2014

445
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,159
form bill so we are we have completed 10

446
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,719
years of field research and since 2017

447
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,080
or 2018 we have seen more and more

448
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,200
fusarium headlight and we're especially

449
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,439
seeing it in Grain hm so just kind of

450
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,840
heads up

451
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,720
there fusarium headlight is best known

452
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:14,918
for um as a disease in cereal crops so

453
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,519
fusarium headlight or wheat scab uh we

454
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:21,240
know it in wheat in cereal grains and in

455
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,079
corn most importantly fusarium headlight

456
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,919
or budlight if you don't have grain

457
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,720
right we call it headlight if it's got

458
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,640
grain head budlight if it's a floral

459
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,240
floral cultiv or a non-pollinated

460
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,840
cultivar it's the same disease um but

461
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,038
the fuser the pathogens that cause

462
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:40,359
fusarium produce mot toxins that can be

463
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,119
detrimental or or or dangerous for

464
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,759
humans and for animals so some very

465
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,798
common ones are Dawn and T2 those are

466
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,599
two fusarium mot toxins that are

467
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,960
regulated in serial grains we're not to

468
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,798
that point in hemp um they should be

469
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,759
regulated we are working on that with

470
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,079
our research program but these mot

471
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,519
toxins again in we're working on test

472
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:07,000
kits but that is another reason why

473
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,200
fusarium headlight is um is a problem

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,119
for

475
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:16,679
us so in Kentucky and in neighboring

476
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:19,678
states we have surveyed um um hemp and

477
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,679
we have determined that fusarium garum

478
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,559
fusarium aium fusarium sporo troides and

479
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,600
the fusarium inornatum equiset uh

480
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,839
species complex are the most common

481
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,439
causal agents of fusarium headlight

482
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,199
fusarium garum is the one that everyone

483
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,320
knows that's the one we talk so much

484
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,840
about and um uh garum and spor troides

485
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,240
are what we call the um the Trine

486
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,798
producers so that's where those

487
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,400
dangerous mot toxins are going to come

488
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:55,400
in fusarium headlight though also causes

489
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:59,240
a blight of the heads so uh the image on

490
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,798
the right we will see where the disease

491
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,440
is there closest to the stem where that

492
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:08,558
there that uh bud or that head is dense

493
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,558
and there's limited air

494
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,038
circulation and here's some closer looks

495
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,480
um there's that picture again on the

496
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,359
right it's blown up a little bit more so

497
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,319
infection will begin near the stem like

498
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,918
I said here I'll get my cursor here so

499
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,558
uh it will begin near the stem and where

500
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,640
it is dense where there's limited air

501
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,079
circulation probably a lot higher

502
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,038
humidity there and that's where that's

503
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:38,240
where the disease will start to

504
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:39,879
develop um in wheat fusarium headlight

505
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,599
is known to infect through the male

506
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,760
flower parts uh during anthesis that's

507
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:49,519
not happening here uh what we have found

508
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:52,200
that um infection will occur pretty much

509
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,599
any time but we have a lot more disease

510
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,319
a lot higher amounts of fungal DNA

511
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,918
during the reproductive phases of this

512
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,439
disease

513
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,080
um so so there's no indication that male

514
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,840
flowers are uh driving that infection as

515
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,480
a matter of fact we have tested male

516
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:14,278
flowers and they can be equally um

517
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,519
equally susceptible but that is not that

518
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:20,640
is not affecting us here as we talk

519
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:23,000
about grain and female flowers um ferium

520
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,640
headlight looks a lot like damage from

521
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,200
some of your budworms like corn earworm

522
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,038
so you have to be really careful if

523
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,519
you're looking at that you have to take

524
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,158
a closer look make sure you're not

525
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:36,158
seeing that frass or those Bud worms but

526
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,120
this picture on the left um that looks a

527
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,480
lot like budworm damage to me so you've

528
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,119
got to actually spread out um that

529
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,558
flower or that head and you have to look

530
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,079
inside and looking for that white

531
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:50,599
Mycelia that colonization and what

532
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,240
you'll see as a progression of symptoms

533
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:55,319
of that blighting uh whereas if it was a

534
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,359
bud worm you would see chew marks and

535
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,599
you would see where where there's that

536
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,079
girdling happen happening as a result of

537
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,079
those chew

538
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,319
marks okay so here here are some

539
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:11,000
additional pictures and um I kind of

540
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,079
want to drive this home a little bit um

541
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,319
that here on the right you'll see that

542
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,798
infection you'll see that Melia that

543
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,200
fungal that white fungal stringy body

544
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:22,119
you'll see that happening here and then

545
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,919
of course there's that spread spreading

546
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,359
inside that head and as it moves up

547
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,520
everything above it pretty much D so

548
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,519
you'll start to see that that blighting

549
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,879
occur at a larger scale the image on the

550
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:39,038
left that entire head blighted

551
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,720
out um so the Rainier it is the more of

552
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,558
this Mycelia you'll see if it's dry

553
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,960
you'll have disease spread inside the

554
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,558
plants and you won't see as much of that

555
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,840
Mycelia um if you do see that fuzzy

556
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,558
Mycelia colonizing it could be confused

557
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:59,240
with petritis gray mold as a matter of

558
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,079
fact here in Kentucky we're not seeing

559
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,880
gry mold we're not finding Bettis in the

560
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,158
field and so when we see this fuzzy

561
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,520
colonization it's almost always fusarium

562
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,240
headlight so be careful of that one if

563
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,319
you're in a Northern climate where it's

564
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,000
cool especially as fall kind of comes

565
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,519
around and it starts uh we start seeing

566
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,480
those cool nights you could very well

567
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:22,558
have um you could very well have betrus

568
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
but in Kentucky and definitely further

569
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:28,440
south than us we're not seeing betrus

570
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,440
because it's just too hot

571
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:37,759
okay so um the amount of Biselia will

572
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:40,759
vary um by the species of fusarium

573
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,519
that's infected okay so we see incor

574
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:47,119
meetti gets really fuzzy kind of like on

575
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,000
the left whereas usually the garum has a

576
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,719
lot less of the Mycelia so again don't

577
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,440
let that fool you use a Diagnostic lab

578
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,079
um you are a commercial grower you've

579
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,880
got to know what you have so that that

580
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,038
really depends again

581
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,278
by depending on the weather will really

582
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,919
affect the the amount of colonization

583
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,880
and the spread of

584
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,120
disease fusarium headblade causes as you

585
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,679
see direct losses right so we have the

586
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,079
blighting of those of those grain with

587
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,600
the blighting of that head we'll see

588
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,398
early shattering so there's a direct

589
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:26,319
loss by fusarium headlight and then that

590
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,798
indirect loss which can be that that

591
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,798
those mot toxins so we have kind of a

592
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,798
double whammy

593
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,240
there all right so I I want to mention

594
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,240
Bud architecture or FL or head

595
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,880
architecture here really quickly we are

596
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,240
seeing and this is a little bit

597
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:52,039
anecdotal but we are seeing a lot more

598
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,480
headlight in those heavy dense buds as

599
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:57,720
opposed to the kind of spindly ones

600
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,278
where we have more air circulation this

601
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,079
is an doal we're seeing this in general

602
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,398
a lot of our colleagues around the US

603
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:08,038
are saying the same thing we have not

604
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:10,798
tested that theory yet uh we plan

605
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,839
to uh undoubtedly there is genetic

606
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,158
resistance in there not complete

607
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,918
resistance that we know of but there are

608
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,640
definitely cultivars that are more

609
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,520
susceptible than others and then you add

610
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,038
that bud architecture where we don't

611
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,200
have um good air circulation especially

612
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,240
as those buds get dense and they stay

613
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,960
really um wet and and humid inside those

614
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,000
buds so we can have we can have an

615
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,159
either or going on um I am inclined to

616
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,759
say that we have both so that is work

617
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,760
that we need to

618
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:49,798
do okay I want to mention um this is

619
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:52,960
this is one of our research field plots

620
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:55,278
from um last year or two years ago we

621
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
were looking for time of infection so

622
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,440
let's back up a little bit and I said

623
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,519
that in wheat that infection occurs

624
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,759
around in thesis that's when that male

625
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,679
flower blooms on that male flower part

626
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,519
is exposed on the wheat head that here

627
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,679
in Kentucky happens in

628
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:14,839
may we haven't even planted our hemp yet

629
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,480
in May so the question was how do we

630
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,918
have so much fusarium headlight during

631
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:24,798
the reproductive phase which is usually

632
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:27,600
August in hemp when um anthesis and

633
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:30,639
infection on wheat happens in May and

634
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:33,398
wheat is out of the field in June so

635
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,278
what how do we understand that and so we

636
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:39,798
were looking for time of infection when

637
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:42,679
did help become infected so to do that

638
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,119
we planted this field um this is this is

639
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,679
only part of the field but we planted

640
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,719
every two weeks starting in April so we

641
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,798
planted every two weeks we used three

642
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,679
cultivars an early a mid and a late

643
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:58,240
season cultivar and that basically gave

644
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:01,759
us uh different growth stages at every

645
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,839
planting date what we were aiming for is

646
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:09,720
to compare uh time of planting calendar

647
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:12,278
time of year and then plant growth stage

648
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,360
and that that was what we were aiming to

649
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:17,558
to uh

650
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:19,839
uncover in general so our results were

651
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:22,798
basically that Laten infection occurred

652
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,879
as early as May so Laten infection is

653
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,720
that dormant stage it's that time

654
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,000
between infection and symptom

655
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,360
development so plants were becoming

656
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,200
infected very early they were becoming

657
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:37,678
infected during the vegetative

658
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,120
stages but not showing symptoms so

659
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,759
infection was there um once in this

660
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,239
particular experiment so oh you do see a

661
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,640
wheat cover crop there that's how we en

662
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,120
ensured that we would get disease okay

663
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,000
so high inoculum load in these fields we

664
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,639
did this on purpose so this was a Drill

665
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,319
Seed on a wheat cover crop so this wheat

666
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,960
did not go to seed this was a wheat

667
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,599
cover crop which adds another layer

668
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,240
right another question because if this

669
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,639
wheat never went to flour if this was a

670
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,319
cover crop it never went to flower then

671
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,519
it shouldn't have been infected either

672
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:14,119
right okay so I

673
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:18,798
digress so we had latent infections

674
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:22,599
early not a lot but but enough but our

675
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:24,918
highest amount of of infection and then

676
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,839
symptom development started occurring

677
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,360
during

678
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:31,359
reproduction so plants were highly

679
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,558
susceptible during that reproductive

680
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,798
stage even though they were even though

681
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:39,158
they were not that that uh anther there

682
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:43,599
like like the the wheat

683
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:46,760
scenario okay um the month didn't really

684
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,839
matter and the days after planting did

685
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:51,000
not really matter it was that plant

686
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,119
growth stage it was that reproductive

687
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,159
stage where plants were highly

688
00:30:53,119 --> 00:31:00,119
susceptible and we got pretty quickly we

689
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,760
got infection so we we identified uh we

690
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:05,839
um Quantified the amount of DNA in that

691
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:08,960
plant before symptoms developed and then

692
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,119
um anytime there was rain we had spikes

693
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,798
so we have some weather data lay uh

694
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,278
layered into that too so weather spiked

695
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,440
it but infection was occurring lower

696
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,798
levels during the reproductive

697
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,038
stages as early as may but it was August

698
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,918
during those reproductive stages mostly

699
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:29,158
those reproductive stages where we had

700
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,759
severe

701
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,519
disease I know that's a lot right so

702
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,558
I've just kind of thrown a lot at you

703
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,399
just to think about and this is where we

704
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:41,319
are with this

705
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:45,638
research okay so

706
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:48,000
um the next thing we asked is where it

707
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:50,319
came from right I showed you the wheat

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,919
and if you see the these the center

709
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,200
picture and the one on the left that is

710
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,679
another wheat cover crop that did not go

711
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,840
to Sea all right so we so we planted

712
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,038
hemp we drill seated hemp into this

713
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:06,839
wheek cover

714
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:07,919
crop and we were looking for um we were

715
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,678
looking

716
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,120
for sporulation events right when were

717
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,798
the spores released we know that

718
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,918
fusarium can infect grassy hosts we

719
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:22,879
definitely know it's a major disease in

720
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,360
um in Gman Nicholas crops right so wheat

721
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,120
and

722
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:29,879
cereals there can be very high inoculum

723
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,518
loads if have a full wheat crop but we

724
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:37,600
weren't doing

725
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:40,200
that so so is is fusarium in this case

726
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:43,240
fusarium garum overwintering what's

727
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,960
happening and so how is it surviving is

728
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,880
it surviving on the previous crop um is

729
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,399
there debris and did our um wheat cover

730
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,679
crop have um ferium headlight there were

731
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:59,239
no symptoms by the way so um our

732
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,320
experiments here is we use um a wheat as

733
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,200
a cover crop so we had three Fields with

734
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,839
wheat as a cover crop we had three

735
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,440
Fields with like a mustard cover crop

736
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,240
and then we had three fields that were

737
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,639
tilled so like your traditional um

738
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,960
tilled field cultivated

739
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:19,479
field we had a severe drought again here

740
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,399
in Kentucky in 2024 so it was very hot

741
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,440
it got up into the upper 90s which is

742
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:25,879
unusual for us um but we still had and

743
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,480
you see there are sport traps on the

744
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,480
photo on the right and the photo on the

745
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,919
left you'll see some sport traps going

746
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,240
on there and from those sport traps we

747
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,960
had a very high inoculum load or Spore

748
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,798
Spore detection especially in our wheat

749
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,759
cover crop again we didn't have grain we

750
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:45,519
didn't have that time of enthesis and

751
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,398
infection and we did not have disease on

752
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,839
our wheat cover crop we had a higher

753
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:54,879
Spore load in that

754
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:57,158
wheat we um so so we had less less

755
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,559
disease in the mustard and the tilled

756
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,039
treatments

757
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,079
um so so what is so what is our so what

758
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,038
is our conclusion here right so we had

759
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,239
we did not have wheat in thesis we did

760
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:12,039
have wheat it was um it was tilt it

761
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,199
sorry it was um terminated in

762
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:19,679
May and then it we didn't plant until

763
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,759
June and then uh drought in July and by

764
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,240
August it was hot and dry but we had

765
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:30,560
lots of spores and in turn we had lots

766
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,519
of um DNA present in in those plants we

767
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,199
did not have a lot of disease but we had

768
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:37,320
that DNA

769
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,000
there all right

770
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,599
so what does all this mean what does all

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,039
this matter um seeds can get infected so

772
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,760
besides our direct our direct loss right

773
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:50,878
shattering blighted seeds seeds can get

774
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,919
infected and our hip seeds being

775
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,838
infected can mean a lot of

776
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,199
things um

777
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:01,799
and we we have we have have to tease

778
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,679
those apart right so if we plant higher

779
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,519
populations in the

780
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,799
field whatever we have left can still

781
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,880
become infected light can be really

782
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,920
severe we can have direct losses or uh

783
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,680
seeds can be contaminated and so these

784
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,079
images here show contaminated seeds uh

785
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,799
those seeds are not viable if we're

786
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,720
using them for if using that grain for

787
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,760
seed and more importantly is we're

788
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,759
moving into the space of hemp grain as

789
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,240
an animal feed and even is human human

790
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,440
food right we we eat H Hearts we eat um

791
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,959
we we do eat that grain so what about

792
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,920
myotoxins are we not talking about mot

793
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,039
toxins do we have mot toxins um and so

794
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,960
the previous field so we we have several

795
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:49,239
studies where um Henry Smith was looking

796
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,240
at mot toxins and he's definitely

797
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:55,199
finding Dawn and T2 levels above those

798
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:57,118
thresholds for human and animal feed so

799
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,719
those toxins are there we're not

800
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,880
regulated them and we're not managing

801
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:07,078
disease very well

802
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:09,440
right all right so then what we're

803
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,519
storing this stuff right it's coming out

804
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,480
of our field and we're storing it this

805
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,759
is this is floral hemp this is canabo

806
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,760
hemp but all in all we're storing H so

807
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,760
the diseases that are in the field the

808
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,240
toxins that are in the field are moving

809
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,319
from the field into storage and we do

810
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,199
have fusarium headlight or fusarium

811
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:31,039
budlight on

812
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,439
canabo Helm we have it in Grain Helm so

813
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,599
it's there so once we get into storage

814
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,480
depending on the level of humidity we

815
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,318
can keep we can have um disease

816
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,119
spreading we can have the fungus

817
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:47,719
colonizing more and then we can have um

818
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,200
increases in the amount of MOT toxins

819
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,439
especially if that humidity is high

820
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,879
during storage the photo all the way on

821
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,838
the right and the photo all the way on

822
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,200
the left those are tobacco barns here in

823
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,838
Kentucky so they're hanging uh hemp just

824
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,879
like hang tobacco and the image in the

825
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,159
center that is a greenhouse grower who

826
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,880
is using some old racks but either way

827
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:10,118
all of these scenarios have high

828
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,440
humidity what we do know is that in

829
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:17,680
wheat um that fusarium griin arum will

830
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:21,039
continue to colonize and grow on wheat H

831
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:24,039
as low as 22% relative humidity 22 to

832
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:27,239
25% relative humidity we still have that

833
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:30,079
active fungus in stored grain we also

834
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:32,399
know that wheat has to be dried to 12%

835
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,000
or lower in order to stop MotoX

836
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,720
production are we doing that in him are

837
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
we doing that with our hemp grain are we

838
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,118
doing that with our cannabinoid hemp

839
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,079
that's a question and I don't think we

840
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,960
are so that that could be another

841
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,839
recommendation right is to hurry up and

842
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,119
dry that grain down before those mot

843
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,119
toxins can continue to

844
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,720
multiply here are some examples of how

845
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:02,720
we see hemp um stor post Harvest if you

846
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:05,279
will so um the buds stored and in terms

847
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:08,399
of floral hemp we have some ground

848
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:13,280
biomass that is inevitably making its

849
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,519
way into um to hemp feed um again I told

850
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,480
you that we eat hemp grain right there

851
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,280
is some chocolate that I bought so that

852
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,000
is that those are hemp hearts in that

853
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,599
chocolate so we're eating hemp grain

854
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,760
we're feeding it to our animals um new

855
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:32,280
here in Kentucky and even in the ecoin

856
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:36,200
industry up to 30% um 30% um hemp feed

857
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,040
and then laying hens right so we need to

858
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:41,799
treat this grain like we treat other

859
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,960
grains we need to manage disease like an

860
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,920
agronomic crop that it is we need to

861
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,199
manage disease and we need to manage

862
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,200
this grain just like we do our our grain

863
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,719
um our our our agronomic grains or

864
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:56,399
serial

865
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:58,838
grains I know that uh breeding efforts

866
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,280
are under way um in fact at Cornell

867
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,639
there's a breeding program so we have

868
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,839
breeding programs that um several

869
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,159
scientists are looking at breeding hemp

870
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,078
so we need to make sure that we're

871
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:11,358
breeding against ferium headlight SE uh

872
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,240
we're breeding for sorry ferium

873
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,598
headlight resistance so it's a very

874
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,439
important disease we need to look

875
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,838
further at that we also need fungicides

876
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,480
we need seed treatments for damping off

877
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,599
and um we need to be able to manage

878
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,838
diseases across the board in particular

879
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,838
again the damping off and the Arium

880
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,318
headlight okay so with that um I'll

881
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,000
close up um there are a lot of resources

882
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:43,159
available for a lot of other diseases um

883
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,318
our put our UK dep depart H sorry

884
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,199
Department of Plant Pathology uh web

885
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:48,639
page here um so you can go to that web

886
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,439
page and then hit extension and

887
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:55,039
resources on social media um my handle

888
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,838
is at KY plant disease on pretty much

889
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,519
any of your social media platforms and

890
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:01,838
at Nicole go on YouTube we have 10 years

891
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,559
worth of research piled up here I work

892
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,279
on a lot of specialty crop so you'll see

893
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:09,838
a lot of specialty crop resources here

894
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,599
um also I want to plug that very last uh

895
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,880
that very last URL so I am part of a

896
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:18,240
working group that I work with scientist

897
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,200
at um at Cornell as well uh Dr Chris

898
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,318
Smart in particular and we are

899
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:26,118
developing um a resource a a national

900
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:29,800
resource a curated database for our

901
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,400
Growers so uh lots of research out there

902
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,560
not just at Kentucky but in other states

903
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,358
so uh with that Lucia we will take

904
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,358
questions

905
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:46,679
hello so we've asked people to ask their

906
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:49,519
questions using the Q&amp;A Buton can you um

907
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:53,279
see them or would you like me to read

908
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:56,280
them um let's do both I pulled them up

909
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,960
but let's make sure that um maybe you

910
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,800
can read them so I don't see skip

911
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,119
anybody okay so the first question says

912
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,039
or comment says hello Nicole thank you

913
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,920
for teaching US general question on this

914
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,358
topic is fiber hemp comparable to grain

915
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,920
hemp in its pathogen

916
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:20,039
susceptibility good question so we don't

917
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,440
really look at um well we our fiber hemp

918
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,239
is harvested before grain develops we

919
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,358
definitely have damping off diseases so

920
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:29,078
it gets all the same diseases but fiber

921
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:32,960
hemp goes in out of the the uh field so

922
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,318
fast so really um D the damping off

923
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,559
diseases those seed and seedling

924
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,318
diseases would probably be those to

925
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,838
worry about but fiber hemp is not

926
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:47,039
resistant it's just really not uh in the

927
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:50,400
field when we um when we're having these

928
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,400
problems or we're not counting it

929
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,599
right

930
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,319
excellent the next one says thanks

931
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,880
Nicole do you normally re recommend the

932
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:06,358
Growers till to uh manage

933
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,280
disease oh so usually till no till is a

934
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:11,078
um is a farmer practice and Farmers have

935
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,480
adopted that for other crops so we

936
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:14,839
really are not making those

937
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,838
recommendations what we have seen though

938
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:20,480
is that cover crops like mustards or

939
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,000
clovers might or definitely going to be

940
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,599
that better option if we're talking

941
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,880
about um an oculum buildup fusarium

942
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,480
headlight so we have um we have one

943
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,160
year's data on that but the amount of

944
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,240
fusarium headlight um in the wheat cover

945
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,920
crop versus the mustard and the Tilt are

946
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:40,399
very different so I'm not saying no

947
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,639
cover crops but it uh we definitely have

948
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,280
um a correlation between wheat as a

949
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,920
cover crop and the amount of fusarium

950
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,839
headlight in the

951
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,760
field super

952
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,519
interesting the next question is about

953
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,640
pythium it attacks the root cortex and

954
00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:00,000
leaves behind the root Steel

955
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,279
root Center tissue yeah so it's it's

956
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,960
it's decaying that cortex so the cortex

957
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,160
kind of rots off as sloughs off and that

958
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,119
steel just kind of stays stays there um

959
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:12,199
I it is um affecting that steel to a

960
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,920
point but it's that soft cortex that

961
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:15,399
sloughs off so that's kind of more of

962
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
our indication I'm not saying that the

963
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,800
steel is not affected but the cortex is

964
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,358
definitely affected first and it's it's

965
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,440
it's really prominent once you see it

966
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:25,639
you'll you'll get it so play around with

967
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,079
it this year I hope you don't have

968
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:32,199
pythium but if you do you'll see

969
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:36,160
it and if the plant stem and leaves are

970
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:38,480
affected example by ronia but the plant

971
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:41,199
still flowers and produces grain is that

972
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,760
grain still fit for

973
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,239
consumption okay so generally yes so

974
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,200
generally um a crown rot will stay at

975
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,598
the bottom now if you have a web light

976
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:52,919
coming up we usually see that more uh in

977
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,760
cannabinoid cultivars not as much in

978
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,680
Grain cultivars um so rise octonia can

979
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,880
affect grain but it's unlik it'll get

980
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,799
that high generally rise octonia is at

981
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,599
the base of the plant but when it gets

982
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,359
hot and dry and that Crown is infected

983
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,000
um and and that girdling occurs you

984
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:11,000
usually see a

985
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,838
collapse so Joselyn is curious about the

986
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,480
balance between disease management and

987
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:23,358
regenerative

988
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,519
practices that's a tough one right

989
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,279
that's a really tough one because we do

990
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,199
want cover crops we do want these no

991
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,960
till systems but we have to understand

992
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,480
the limitations now of course if we're

993
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,400
rotating our Fields if we're if we're

994
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,559
using cover crops that are not uh

995
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,400
cereals we can definitely get around

996
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,880
that so I again I'm not saying don't use

997
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,440
cover crops but anytime we have a

998
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,920
disease epidemic we have to start

999
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,960
questioning all of our other practices

1000
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,119
but crop rotations are really important

1001
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,880
and to rotate with non-host hopefully

1002
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,079
we're really bringing that uh that

1003
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,960
inoculum level down but to find other

1004
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:01,318
cover crops I would love to look at a

1005
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,358
wider range of cover crops because we've

1006
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,838
kind of we were quite surprised that a

1007
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:08,199
wheat cover crop that never went to

1008
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,358
grain or flour had that high of an

1009
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:11,919
inoculum

1010
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:15,679
load and Joselyn you'll be seeing

1011
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,639
Henry's uh talk um probably at APS or

1012
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,838
something so you'll be able to see those

1013
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:24,440
numbers so it's it's quite

1014
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:27,078
shocking choose your cover crops wisely

1015
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,960
then um

1016
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,079
next question is it common that

1017
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,400
headlight can be acquired via

1018
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,039
pollination I have noticed that when I

1019
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,680
do control breeding the pollinated heads

1020
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:41,519
sometimes mold while where the

1021
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:44,279
surrounding flowers aren't noticibly

1022
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,039
affected can pollin be combined with the

1023
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,640
control bacteria to prevent the

1024
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:53,119
mold okay wow that's a loaded um I don't

1025
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,118
think fusarium headlight moves by by

1026
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,358
pollinators I can double back on that I

1027
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,519
can check on that I don't know the

1028
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:02,159
answer I don't think so or it's not it's

1029
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:06,079
not a it's I don't know about it um so I

1030
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:09,440
can double check on that um and then uh

1031
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,480
can pollen be combined with the um

1032
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,639
control bacteria to prevent mold okay so

1033
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,880
we are looking at Biologicals to see if

1034
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,000
there are some of our biological agents

1035
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,240
that are effective against ferium

1036
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,480
headlight um right now we have not had

1037
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,919
efficacy on any of them now are we

1038
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,800
spraying at the right times are we us

1039
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,200
using those products correctly we have

1040
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,280
research in the pipeline that we want to

1041
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,558
look at for that um but right now we

1042
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,359
don't know of any of we we haven't seen

1043
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,880
any of the commercial biological

1044
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:42,759
products including the basilis products

1045
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,838
that are effective against fusarium

1046
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,359
headlight during flowering and grain

1047
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:52,159
development um more work to be done on

1048
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,159
that but right now the answer is

1049
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:59,679
no okay the next common question is what

1050
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,880
passes me is that mold affects also the

1051
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:05,279
flower and valve area at the top of the

1052
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,400
plant apparently the Turpin ET

1053
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,640
metabolites from the triom are that are

1054
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,039
there are not able to prevent every kind

1055
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,838
of fungus or

1056
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:19,960
microbes uh what's your take on that wow

1057
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:22,759
okay that's outside of my area um but

1058
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,720
but there there has been talk that um

1059
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,359
propenes and and even some of the um

1060
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:32,000
cannabinoids or anti

1061
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:34,078
fungal um hemp and cannabis as we see it

1062
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,039
is is an agronomic crop it's a

1063
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,519
Horticultural crop and it is susceptible

1064
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:43,440
to lots of different diseases um so I I

1065
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:45,838
do not see where um yeah I don't know

1066
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,000
the answer to specifically your question

1067
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,000
but we see lots of disease across the

1068
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,559
board how do you manage the diseases in

1069
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:59,318
Camp since there are few if any

1070
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,519
fungicides registered for you on it's a

1071
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:02,558
tough one right so that's what we're

1072
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:04,838
waiting for so we have a we have a

1073
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,000
program called ir4 where we're working

1074
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:09,039
to get some of these fungicides labeled

1075
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,679
so hopefully some are in the pipeline I

1076
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,558
don't know of any I don't think there's

1077
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:16,679
any that are going to Target um husum

1078
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,319
but we definitely have one right now in

1079
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,799
trials that hopefully we'll get some

1080
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,480
labeling in the next couple of years for

1081
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,359
pythium um so and and there are some

1082
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,559
also in the pipeline for other fungal

1083
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:31,000
diseases so um it's hard to manage

1084
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,720
disease when we have a very new crop we

1085
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,559
have limited research uh 10 years is not

1086
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,959
a long time um so we're getting there

1087
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,599
we're getting there slowly um hopefully

1088
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,240
we'll have more products on the market

1089
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,559
in the next couple of years but right

1090
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:47,239
now we're triing everything that we can

1091
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,798
we're trying to get honest answers so

1092
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,318
any University Research unbiased we have

1093
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:54,719
nothing to sell so check with your

1094
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,480
universities check for any University

1095
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,318
Research that you can get your hands on

1096
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,480
it will tell you what's working what's

1097
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,599
not and all of that gradient in between

1098
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,559
um so yes we're we're working towards it

1099
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:10,519
we're getting there but not as fast as

1100
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:10,519
uh we all want it to

1101
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,559
go have you seen more incidents of

1102
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,880
ferian ferium on mishas than female

1103
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:22,880
individuals due to sessing male flowers

1104
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,720
in the grain pad oh that is a really

1105
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,920
good question uh no we have not um

1106
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:29,959
generally the male flowers have died off

1107
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,119
we have detected latent infection in

1108
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,880
male flowers but in general once that

1109
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,000
once that head starts to develop it's um

1110
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,119
you know plant is securely in its

1111
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,280
reproductive that female head is

1112
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,160
securely in its reproductive phase it's

1113
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,760
highly susceptible and then of course

1114
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,000
when you have that very dense head or

1115
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,359
Bud where you don't have a lot of air

1116
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,159
circulation you've got that high

1117
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:54,838
moisture again I talked about

1118
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:57,199
architecture so I don't see a

1119
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:59,318
correlation per se

1120
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,000
um but again male flowers are kind of

1121
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:02,000
gone at that

1122
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:08,838
point how do you distinguish between

1123
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:12,798
ferium and vrtis infection in the

1124
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:15,239
flowers if you have a hand lens um so

1125
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:18,199
any kind of magnification lens you can

1126
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:19,719
usually see pretty well um butrus will

1127
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:21,639
look like a little tree so it'll have a

1128
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:23,879
stock and it'll have some little um

1129
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:26,400
structures on top and it's more of a

1130
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,519
gray um so once you train your eye you

1131
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,838
can sort of see it uh we use a

1132
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:33,679
microscope so we take it back we use a

1133
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:37,679
microscope um but fusarium is generally

1134
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:39,519
white and gray mold is typically gray um

1135
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:42,078
don't just don't just look far back you

1136
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,639
at least have to have a hand lens but um

1137
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:48,079
you're commercial grower definitely use

1138
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,078
a Diagnostic lab you've got to be

1139
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,838
sure we like looking at things under the

1140
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,479
microscop we love looking at things

1141
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,798
under microscopes and with hand lenses

1142
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,119
and they're always in our pockets and

1143
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:02,199
our bags and our cars so yes we want to

1144
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,358
teach you to do it too um but they're

1145
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:07,000
like they're like less than $10 if you

1146
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:09,558
get them online so you can uh sometimes

1147
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,039
get like a 40x mine are usually a 20x

1148
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,000
but you can get them usually 40x or so

1149
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:15,920
and again under $10 so you should have

1150
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,159
lots um

1151
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,680
everywhere okay I

1152
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:24,078
agree so the next question is related to

1153
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,199
a previous one I'll read it just in case

1154
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,359
you want to add something do you think

1155
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,439
that many es grain Dual Purpose cultivar

1156
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,960
may be more susceptible to headlights

1157
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,280
than the ises cultivar because of the

1158
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,400
early sessing ve

1159
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,839
flowers we have not seen that

1160
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,880
correlation we haven't looked really

1161
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:46,440
closely but we haven't seen that

1162
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:49,480
correlation um so I don't think so um

1163
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,480
but I'm I'm not

1164
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,000
absolute how to H how to recognize

1165
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,839
reproductive stage male flowers are

1166
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:04,400
flowering or female flowers or time of

1167
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,400
both or something

1168
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:12,559
else I'm not sure I understand the

1169
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:14,798
question um it might be uh for cannabis

1170
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,000
when uh do you say that it started

1171
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:20,639
flowering uh for males versus

1172
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,199
females so when we're talking so when

1173
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:26,318
when I talk about reproductive stages

1174
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm talking about that density um so you

1175
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,358
know again we're talking about grain

1176
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,280
hemp um we're talking about that heavier

1177
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:35,279
denser bud not those early initials

1178
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,559
where you'll start seeing those U you

1179
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,640
know questioning is this a male or a

1180
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,880
female flower I'm talking about later

1181
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,598
than that I'm talking about when you've

1182
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,160
got that that dense Bud um again when

1183
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,039
you're in in that field and you start

1184
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:50,519
getting that um that condensed growth

1185
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:52,039
that's what I'm talking about um and and

1186
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:53,639
we have again we've we've done that

1187
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:57,079
latent infection study we've kind of

1188
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:59,199
looked at a lot of different stages um

1189
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,200
that early reproductive mid and later

1190
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,879
reproductive but

1191
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:09,039
um this is more this is more of a of a

1192
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,358
much later um stage and we I we're

1193
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:11,719
working on the data right now for that

1194
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:14,119
lat infection study we're about to

1195
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:15,279
submit it for publication so I'll I'll

1196
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:16,680
now you're making me question I'm going

1197
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,280
to look at that and see if there's

1198
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:22,078
anything that we know about those very

1199
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,079
early reproductive stages versus the

1200
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,200
later what are the best cover crops

1201
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,599
grasses or leguminous options in

1202
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,078
Kentucky to break the cycle of pathogens

1203
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,039
like

1204
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:40,200
ferian um anything that's not a a grass

1205
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:42,759
right um so if fusarium headlight

1206
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:46,639
infects grasses

1207
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:50,160
or um graminicolous hosts or cereals

1208
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,920
those are the ones you don't want so um

1209
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,598
I know that legumes can become infected

1210
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,280
but it's not really likely we haven't

1211
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:00,640
looked at that um I would would just say

1212
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,720
breaking that cycle from a um a seral

1213
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:05,719
based cover crop and again I'm basing

1214
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:08,358
this on the research that we have done

1215
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:11,558
we have not we've not done a widespread

1216
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:13,759
cover crop trial um you know we we did

1217
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:17,079
that one with just the the three right

1218
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,640
the mustard the till and the wheat so

1219
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:20,318
there are a lot of other things we can

1220
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,598
ask we haven't gotten there yet and I

1221
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:26,039
don't even know across the cereals you

1222
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:28,480
know is is barley a better U cover crop

1223
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:30,798
than I don't know the answer to that but

1224
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,960
right now we're just saying that it it

1225
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:36,000
appears that your cereals are definitely

1226
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,519
contributing to an oculum load even if

1227
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,079
they're used as cover crops and not let

1228
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:45,759
flour such an interesting question right

1229
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:49,680
right and you know hemp is not um a

1230
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,440
monocot so how this is playing along

1231
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,039
that's a big question too right so it's

1232
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,240
not like we're plant you know we are

1233
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,199
breaking the cycle we're planting um a

1234
00:54:55,239 --> 00:55:01,639
dcot followed you know after that

1235
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:05,000
monocot uh wheat cover crop and um this

1236
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:06,159
is what we get yeah and still still get

1237
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,599
it

1238
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:12,399
right um this one is suggested to H

1239
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,880
water content in soil is there a

1240
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,480
suggested soil moisture range that can

1241
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,318
be maintained in a green pouse to avoid

1242
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:23,358
ferium or any of these

1243
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:27,079
diseases so your soil moisture content

1244
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:30,159
is going to drive plant health so um um

1245
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:32,440
and fusarium is fusarium is not a soil

1246
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,838
born disease right so it is it is in

1247
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,159
debris but then it moves up into the

1248
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:39,239
canopy so soil moisture should not

1249
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:41,879
correlate to the amount of fusarium

1250
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:44,679
headlight um yes there's moisture but

1251
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,440
that's more of a humidity thing um but I

1252
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:50,078
don't think you can reduce your soil

1253
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:54,039
moisture enough to um adequately reduce

1254
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,039
um canopy canopy uh

1255
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:01,480
humidity thank you yes we have lots of

1256
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,480
questions I see that they keep

1257
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:07,520
coming um the next one is about uh the

1258
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,000
recording yes we are recording and we

1259
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:12,838
are going to upload it in this coming

1260
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,719
days to our uh School of Integrative

1261
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:17,759
science YouTube channel I've uh I've

1262
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:21,279
added the link to the chat so you can

1263
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,079
find it uh in the chat

1264
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,880
part the next question is what kind of

1265
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,920
SE treatment can we do to reduce dumping

1266
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,640
off

1267
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,200
pressure so in other crops we have seed

1268
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,879
treatments in uh hemp we do not have a

1269
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:37,879
seed treatment um we are going to be I

1270
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,960
have a student that is looking at some

1271
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:43,838
of some sea treatments with some of our

1272
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,358
Biologicals um I'm not sure where that's

1273
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:47,440
going to take us so maybe if there is a

1274
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:50,838
seed treatment or at least a an at

1275
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,559
planting drench um we're looking at some

1276
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:54,639
of those I'm hoping that we can get a

1277
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:58,798
seed

1278
00:56:54,639 --> 00:57:01,358
treatment product in in our ir4 um

1279
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,318
rotation that's the um that's the

1280
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:06,000
labeling uh program that I was talking

1281
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:07,759
about but we are definitely looking

1282
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,239
we've just finished two years of looking

1283
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,599
at products that are effective against

1284
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:15,358
pythium and the water molds so hopefully

1285
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,359
maybe we can have a label for drenching

1286
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,279
in green houses and Fields um so again I

1287
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:23,598
hope in the next couple of

1288
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,760
years but definitely greenhouse and um

1289
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,920
and field was our Target because we know

1290
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,720
that pythium is affecting lots of

1291
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,920
different kinds of cannabis production

1292
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,519
not just grain

1293
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,838
heill and we have a perfect follow-up

1294
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:41,358
question what are your recommended

1295
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:43,279
treatments for fil infection in hemp if

1296
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:46,598
you want to mention

1297
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,400
the that's for later for the publication

1298
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:52,200
yes give me this year to finish that up

1299
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,480
um I am working on uh several projects

1300
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,279
in fact Dr smart and I have some that

1301
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,000
are kind of going on as well so

1302
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,000
hopefully by next winter we'll be able

1303
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
to have some solid recommendations for

1304
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,920
everybody um I I don't wanna I don't

1305
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,639
want to make any recommendations right

1306
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,798
now so Biologicals are hard I will say

1307
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:13,358
that Biologicals are often alive

1308
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:16,440
sometimes they induce resistance but a

1309
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:19,038
lot of times they are alive and we don't

1310
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,559
know how to use them um you know how

1311
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,160
long do they persist on Plants what

1312
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,440
happens if it's hot what if it doesn't

1313
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,759
rain what if it rains too much so to

1314
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,318
learn how to use Biologicals is a whole

1315
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,839
another layer of questions because those

1316
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,318
of us who are trained with conventional

1317
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,279
fungicides we put them on and they work

1318
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,038
whereas Biologicals have have a

1319
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,880
different Dynamic and we have we have a

1320
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:40,880
lot to learn

1321
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:48,559
there so terrific talk thanks for all

1322
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,720
the great info this is a message is

1323
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,640
Green Camp as sticky as cannaboid types

1324
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:56,719
just wondering how that might affect

1325
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,759
airf flow and humidity the sticky but

1326
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:01,078
not as

1327
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,880
sticky um but there's still some of our

1328
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,839
grain cultivars can have those those

1329
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,880
heavy U grain heads but remember we're

1330
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:10,759
planting them closer we have a different

1331
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,680
architecture we have a very high

1332
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:15,960
population rate these are very straight

1333
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:19,798
up plants very condensed um I don't know

1334
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:22,480
if I had any images in my um in my

1335
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,599
PowerPoint but um yeah planted very

1336
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,798
close together there's no air

1337
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,880
circulation in those fields like a lot

1338
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,920
of we're not even planting them on rows

1339
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,519
we're um we're broadcast planting or

1340
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,000
we're planting you know those rows are

1341
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:37,358
very close so no air circulation going

1342
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,159
on by the time reproductive phas is

1343
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:43,598
hit wow that's that's really

1344
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:46,558
tight um have you found some cover crops

1345
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,640
are better than others for seed

1346
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,519
establishment we don't know the answer

1347
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:54,639
to that um I I don't know we we haven't

1348
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:56,318
really looked at cover crops right so

1349
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,598
usually it's the agronomist who look at

1350
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:02,239
cover crops so you know we we just have

1351
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,039
our one year of data with the wheat and

1352
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,399
uh and mustard so this is kind of new

1353
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,280
for us and of course with any great

1354
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,960
experiment comes a thousand new

1355
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,480
questions so we have as many questions

1356
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,559
as you do um we're going to repeat that

1357
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,079
experiment with the mustards wheat and

1358
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,760
till but I don't know what our future

1359
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:21,039
looks like in terms of different cover

1360
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,520
crops um I can think of a lot of great

1361
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,400
ones but I don't know where our

1362
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:26,400
priorities are going to stand

1363
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,440
no it's it's a mix of disciplines right

1364
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:34,200
but it really is come together and you

1365
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,798
know there there's so few of us working

1366
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:41,960
on hemp and you know funding sources are

1367
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:44,400
difficult and time and so we have to

1368
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,960
prioritize and we want to do everything

1369
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,160
yesterday and it just doesn't quite fall

1370
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,000
that way like we wish it would yes we

1371
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:56,519
[Laughter]

1372
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,880
wish is 50 Fahrenheit and wet good

1373
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:02,038
temperature for dumping off we recommend

1374
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,160
warmer soil temperatures for planting

1375
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:07,119
but some are advocating for early spring

1376
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:09,719
planting in the field some of your

1377
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,599
pathogens like like like cool

1378
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:14,078
temperatures right I talked about

1379
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,440
pythium um pythium some of your pythium

1380
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,760
can infect really really early in that

1381
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,679
cool wet soil others um like rise

1382
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,559
octonia like it when it's hot and wet so

1383
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,078
I I kind of lump them all together today

1384
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,720
just for time sake but but definitely um

1385
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,839
the slower a plant establishes the

1386
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:36,919
longer it is in that seed and seedling

1387
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:39,639
phase so the longer exposure you have to

1388
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:41,280
any pathogen so any of those cool season

1389
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:45,000
pathogens that are there whatever those

1390
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,160
may be so um it could be even some

1391
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,760
opportunistic pathogens if that if that

1392
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:50,598
seed or seedling is just kind of

1393
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,119
lingering there with that very slow

1394
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:55,400
spring so it's really about getting that

1395
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,760
plant off to a good start and getting

1396
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:02,440
that plant into into a um vegetative

1397
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:04,599
stage as soon as possible you're better

1398
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,679
off I don't know didn't really answer

1399
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,720
your question but there are definitely

1400
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:12,000
some pathogens that can affect at 50

1401
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:14,679
degrees warmer is always better for the

1402
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,798
plant it is good to know I'll keep that

1403
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,239
in mind too I missed the first part of

1404
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:23,159
the webinar did you discuss petritis and

1405
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:25,558
it's control I did not discuss Bettis

1406
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:27,399
today um we talk about Bettis and other

1407
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,359
pram programs I know the Cornell group

1408
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,599
has discussed petritis in some of their

1409
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,239
programs I did not do that today um I

1410
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,720
went from kind of from damping off to

1411
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:37,679
fusarium headlight uh because those are

1412
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,199
grain focused uh we don't have a lot of

1413
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,919
betrus here in Kentucky we see betrus in

1414
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:44,759
the greenhouse especially early season

1415
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,559
and late season um but we don't really

1416
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,240
see betrus in the field um my only

1417
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,480
comment was that a lot of times if

1418
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:53,399
Growers tell me they have betras and a

1419
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,079
follow up it's often fusarium when

1420
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,039
they're seeing that colonization so

1421
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:59,359
depending on where you are talk to your

1422
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:02,000
extension Educators talk to your

1423
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:04,278
Diagnostic lab and find out because they

1424
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,278
can look

1425
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:08,400
similar no it's great that you don't

1426
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:10,798
have at tritis there no one will

1427
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,559
complain we have other

1428
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:16,679
things and we don't have any any plant

1429
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:20,599
viruses either so uh lots of the other

1430
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:24,318
things so we trade them

1431
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:27,119
out um what kind of rotation schemes are

1432
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:30,400
there and what is the ation

1433
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:33,000
L guessing associated with the feels in

1434
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,079
which you grain hemp I'm I'm assuming

1435
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:40,639
that's the question um so we have not

1436
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:42,440
looked directly at rotation so um so

1437
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:45,038
depending on what your disease pressure

1438
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:48,039
is is going to dictate what your

1439
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,119
rotational partners are what type of

1440
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:51,760
plants are you willing to grow right are

1441
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:53,960
you going to grow sugar beads or are you

1442
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,400
going to grow sugar cane or you're going

1443
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:02,318
to grow right cereal or tomatoes so

1444
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:07,000
rotation is dependent on the Farm's um

1445
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:09,400
on the Farm's production type um and

1446
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,920
usually we always say it standard a

1447
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,559
three-year rotation cycle will break a

1448
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,639
disease cycle most of the time but again

1449
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:19,640
you're not breaking a cycle if you plant

1450
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:21,118
another susceptible host behind it and

1451
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:24,038
that's what I was talking about when I

1452
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:27,599
talked about ferium headlight in cereals

1453
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:30,480
and in HP but but every disease is going

1454
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,960
to have its own Dynamic so what are the

1455
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,920
major disease concerns on your form what

1456
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,880
are you willing to rotate do you have

1457
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,000
enough land to rotate for three years

1458
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,798
and if you have something really severe

1459
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,440
right like us Arian Wilt your your

1460
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:45,199
rotation might be longer than three

1461
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,720
years so three years is kind of our

1462
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:51,838
standard rule of thumb

1463
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:54,159
rotation um so again talk to your local

1464
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:57,199
extension educator explain what your

1465
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:58,879
form does and and uh and make those

1466
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:01,278
decisions on what your rotation partners

1467
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,160
are but using your Diagnostic lab will

1468
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:05,480
confirm what you have if you don't know

1469
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:06,759
what you have it's a shot in the dark so

1470
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,519
you always want to know what you have

1471
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,799
you want that confirmed and then you've

1472
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:11,159
got information you're armed with

1473
01:05:09,798 --> 01:05:14,679
information to move forward and make

1474
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:17,759
some real decisions that make a

1475
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:19,719
difference keep the diseases in mind

1476
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,240
what's that yes in terms of diseases now

1477
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:24,000
your insects and your pests that's a

1478
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:27,319
whole different story then we layer on

1479
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,239
Weeds fertility so I am disease

1480
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:33,119
[Laughter]

1481
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:36,439
only um in regards to pum species would

1482
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,519
you agree that the oospores are capable

1483
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,358
of traveling through the air making

1484
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:41,358
prevention a

1485
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:48,760
must wow

1486
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:52,720
um pythium and your soil born pathogens

1487
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:55,880
move through soil and plant material so

1488
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:59,278
if you're talking about movement of of

1489
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:01,000
any soil born pathogen pythium included

1490
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:03,079
um you were thinking about the way you

1491
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,278
move soil and soil particles because

1492
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:06,960
they're hitchhiking in your soil they're

1493
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:09,039
on the bottom of your shoes they're on

1494
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,240
your tractor tires they're on the wheels

1495
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,160
to your cart they're on your dirty

1496
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:15,479
implements right they're on the bottom

1497
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:18,879
of your muddy jees so that's where

1498
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:21,278
you're moving your soil born pathogens

1499
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:25,079
right airborn pathogens right so you can

1500
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:26,559
talk about rusts they get up into the um

1501
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:29,039
into air currents and they move long

1502
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,039
distances fusarium can move long

1503
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,119
distances but your soilborne pathogens

1504
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:36,680
are moving through soil and water so

1505
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:39,039
that is surface drainage a lot of times

1506
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:40,960
they're hitchhiking in soil particles or

1507
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,839
we're bringing them in if you're a if

1508
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,199
you're a canabo grower we're bringing

1509
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:46,558
them in and out with

1510
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:48,318
plugs we have a lot of we have a lot of

1511
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,680
pythium in our Fields you know the

1512
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,719
question was about pythium we have so

1513
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:55,798
much pythium in our Fields um I I think

1514
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:57,439
we have in our field that we sample that

1515
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:59,519
I was talking about earlier I think we

1516
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,039
have four or five of the species in our

1517
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:05,358
field that we that we sampled out so

1518
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:07,599
they're there and in an agronomic field

1519
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:10,038
we have just been you know we're monoc

1520
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:13,200
culturing right so we have a lot of them

1521
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:16,200
and they've built up um so if we worried

1522
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:18,838
about movement think about you the

1523
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:21,838
farmer or or humans that's how we're

1524
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:24,400
moving our soil born

1525
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:27,239
pathogens difficult to get read of them

1526
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,000
right yes yes and they are they are the

1527
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:30,278
most challenging absolutely the most

1528
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,039
challenging that's why we talk about

1529
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,000
them so much um because we're all

1530
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:35,839
stumped you're stumped we're stumped so

1531
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,519
that's why we we talk about them so much

1532
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:39,880
because it is really difficult and we

1533
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:43,480
have to break that disease

1534
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:46,039
cycle is filium are common disas in come

1535
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,960
in the Kentucky Region no we don't have

1536
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:50,240
much verticillium at all like I've never

1537
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,559
seen verticillium in lettuce or

1538
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:56,358
vegetables so um rarely do we see

1539
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:58,680
verticillium in anything but Red Buds

1540
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:00,558
and Woody plants so I've never seen it

1541
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:04,759
in

1542
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,720
h you have three more questions okay

1543
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,480
it's are you okay with time yes yes

1544
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:11,719
let's keep

1545
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,760
going so the next question is uh what

1546
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:16,838
can be done to eliminate lesson ferium

1547
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,640
before

1548
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:21,399
storage um disease management in the

1549
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,880
field but what does that mean if we

1550
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:26,479
don't have our fungicide Arsenal right

1551
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:28,159
so um

1552
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,879
if if there's a way we can use cultural

1553
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,639
practices is there if there's a way we

1554
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,600
can start breaking or lessening disease

1555
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:38,719
Cycles thinking about um you know again

1556
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,520
our whe cover crop and then once we get

1557
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,719
um hemp in

1558
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,560
storage we're talking about grain we

1559
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,399
need to dry it down really quickly if

1560
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,239
we're talking about flowers we're not

1561
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:51,920
drying it down definitely not to

1562
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:53,798
12% so I guess it it depends on what

1563
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,600
you're talking about but if it's grain

1564
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:58,640
we need to dry it quickly um faster we

1565
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,079
dry it but whatever we bring in that's

1566
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,920
what we've got so you just want to dry

1567
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:06,278
it down so it doesn't increase after

1568
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,279
store after you get into

1569
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,439
storage what type of diseases do you

1570
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:15,158
normally see in indoor growing

1571
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:18,318
facilities how can it be corrected once

1572
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:21,439
it is spotted during the drying

1573
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:24,120
process okay I'm looking at that as two

1574
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:26,919
questions in indoor growing facilities

1575
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:29,358
we usually see pythium root rots we us

1576
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:32,480
usually see Bettis we see powdery

1577
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,120
milde um and if you introduce anything

1578
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,479
in we can have some other soil born

1579
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:37,640
pathogens that are moved in with

1580
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:41,919
contaminated media Etc but those are

1581
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:44,039
usually the big ones um if you spot

1582
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,520
diseases during the drying process how

1583
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:48,439
can it be corrected it can't um our

1584
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,279
plant pathogens need humidity they need

1585
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:53,479
free water to complete their life cycle

1586
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:57,040
so if we can dry down um we're we're

1587
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:59,158
slowing or stopping um fungal you we

1588
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:01,279
just talking about fungi um stopping

1589
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:03,000
that fungal growth okay so drying it

1590
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:05,238
down but again it depends what the crop

1591
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,119
is because grain hemp is very different

1592
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:10,559
than fiber hemp very different than

1593
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,119
cannaboid hemp so what does dry mean um

1594
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,960
it can be very different things between

1595
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:17,279
the Grain and the and the cannaboid so

1596
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:22,439
um drying it down but there's no there's

1597
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:22,439
no fungicide or there's no um there's no

1598
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:29,158
treatment into stuff and the last

1599
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,079
question that we have is are there feral

1600
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:34,639
cannabis populations growing around

1601
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,640
Kentucky dad oh that's a good question

1602
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,280
so I don't think so so we have gone I

1603
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:43,159
have gone on searches um and I have

1604
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:45,359
followed leads and I have not found it U

1605
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:48,399
we are working with a couple of um

1606
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:51,519
breeders and um some feral hemp programs

1607
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:56,158
and I have not found it um so there

1608
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:58,159
should be um Kentucky was a hemp seed

1609
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:01,839
growing state for World War during World

1610
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:04,238
War II U but we do not um I do not know

1611
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,520
of any feral po populations and if

1612
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:10,238
somebody finds one or has a lead I'm

1613
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:13,280
happy to go go chase it for you but um I

1614
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:16,198
have come up short in the past when when

1615
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,759
um going out to collect for a

1616
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:22,960
collaborator

1617
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,880
oh well if they are I hope you find them

1618
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,359
at some

1619
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,079
point yes yes it would be great if we

1620
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:31,238
did um so I'm always happy to go uh to

1621
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:33,279
follow a lead if you were a breeder I

1622
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:36,678
don't know who whoever the question came
