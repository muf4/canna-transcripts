00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,759
University thanks NE for the

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,718
introduction thank you everyone for

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,560
coming today um I'm Angela and I'm going

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:19,879
to be sharing some research plans and

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,399
some preliminary results for my PhD work

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,640
here which is focusing on nanoscale

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,159
characterization of carbon mineral

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,920
interfaces particularly in intact soil

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,920
microaggregates

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,159
so to start on the very broad scale uh

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,159
these are just some values of carbon

13
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:44,000
stocks and various uh parts of the

14
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:46,640
global carbon budget and soil as we know

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,878
is a fairly large stock of carbon um

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,640
especially compared to vegetation it's

17
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,358
commonly stated to be about three times

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,000
the content of carbon in the atmosphere

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,320
so this really uh relatively large stock

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,159
is important for the overall CL carbon

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,400
budget and whether carbon and soil is

22
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,879
increased or decreased or stay stays

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,439
consistent is a really important factor

24
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,879
for overall carbon

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:17,118
balance so this is just a global soil

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,798
organic carbon distribution um and from

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,159
here on I'll be focusing on organic

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,600
carbon uh showing in Northern permafrost

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,200
really high carbon concentrations in

30
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,519
blue but I also like to focus on some

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,399
more uh hotpots of high high carbon

32
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:37,359
content uh in this case I'd like to talk

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:40,280
mostly about volcanic soils in areas

34
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,519
like the Indonesia Mexico and

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,759
particularly Hawaii um so now zooming

36
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:50,280
into the island of

37
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:53,560
Hawaii the carbon content in volcanic

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,718
soils which are part of the andisol soil

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,640
order have a relatively high carbon

40
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,759
content compared to a lot of the other

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,960
soil orders and also Based on

42
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,759
radiocarbon data a lot of the carbon is

43
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,758
very old meaning that it's fairly stable

44
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,199
and soil and has been there for a long

45
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,958
time but this actually depends a bit on

46
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,598
the age of the soil so if you imagine

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,759
brand new lava deposits just being a few

48
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:25,039
hundred years old ranging to soils that

49
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,439
have been um weathering for 4 million

50
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,519
years somewhere in the middle there's a

51
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:35,719
peak in the amount of carbon content and

52
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:38,120
also carbon age and this uh is a concept

53
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,000
that has been linked um particularly

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,039
with mineral properties of that Medium

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,800
age

56
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,759
soil and this is particularly apparent

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,040
in deeper Horizons uh so this is a map

58
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:54,318
of um carbon organic carbon content at a

59
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:57,598
depth of about 60 to 100 cm with of red

60
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,479
showing higher contents and relative to

61
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,679
for instance the contiguous United

62
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,399
States you can see that deep soil

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319
horizons in Hawaii and other volcanic

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
soils um have much higher carbon

65
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,119
contents and again this is linked with

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,280
particularly uh mineral properties in

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,200
this system and this is a really good

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,000
example of the overall relationship

69
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:24,399
between carbon stabilization and

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,158
minerals um and this is apparent in many

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,760
different ecosystems with varying

72
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,399
degrees of importance dependent on that

73
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,039
minerology so this is a process that I

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,760
like to think about um as ranging from

75
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,359
the ecosystem scale all the way down to

76
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,919
the scale of a few microns a few

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,760
nanometers at the actual interface of

78
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,000
carbon and minerals in soil so again in

79
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,719
the example of the volcanic soils you

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,680
have an ecosystem property minerology um

81
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,000
and in these medium AG soils they are

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,040
dominated by what we call short range

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,680
ordered or semicrystalline mineral Minal

84
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,798
so I'll refer to those kind of as both

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,159
SRO or semicryst minerals for the rest

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,599
of the talk and then moving down to the

87
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,560
Nano scale there are properties at the

88
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,318
actual surface of these minerals such as

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,319
pH dependent charge and high surface

90
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,319
area that are related to their carbon

91
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,319
storage

92
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,319
properties so I'm just going to give a a

93
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,439
brief overview of some of the proposed

94
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,079
mechanisms of carbon stabilization by

95
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,478
minerals but an important concept is

96
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,519
that the actual mechanism involved is

97
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,079
very specific to the mineral uh the type

98
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,120
of carbon present and also the

99
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,439
environmental factors that are at work

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,439
in that particular system so just one

101
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:49,279
example is a mechanism of Li exchange um

102
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,439
or an ion exchange for stabilization of

103
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,478
uh soil organic carbon by the

104
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,918
semicrystalline or short range ordered

105
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,000
minerals that I mentioned earlier in

106
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:01,279
volcanic soils alphane and Amite being

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,839
two examples of that kind of mineral in

108
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,279
addition to Li exchange and an exchange

109
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,478
just a few other General interaction

110
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,638
mechanisms hydrophobic

111
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,599
interactions hydrogen bonding cation

112
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,639
bridging general effects of

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,639
entropy and then a little bit uh Less

114
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,038
Direct than actual surface stabilization

115
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,360
uh you can also have more indirect

116
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,399
effects of physical protection by

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,759
mineral facilitated aggregate formation

118
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,519
or stabilization in pores so these are

119
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,120
all just very general uh proposed

120
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:40,240
mechanisms of carbon stabilization by

121
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,399
minerals one of the uh more interesting

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,879
models of surface interactions is uh the

123
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,679
zonal model proposed by clubber where

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,759
you have amphophilic molecules which

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,199
basically have a polar end and a

126
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,160
non-polar end um creating this kind of

127
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,478
bylayer model where you have the the

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,039
polar end interacting with Sur surface

129
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:07,240
and then the long sort of non-polar

130
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:09,719
Tails interacting in a hydrophobic Zone

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,000
and then lots of potential interactions

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,160
with the aquous solution on the um

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,319
kinetic

134
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,080
zone so there are are many different uh

135
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
proposed

136
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,120
mechanisms but why do does that really

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,560
make a difference if we know it's

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,959
stabilized you know why do we need to

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,680
know how and I think that it's really

140
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,478
important Because the actual mechanism

141
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,240
involved May respond differently to

142
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,000
changing environmental variables uh

143
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,079
increased temperature increased moisture

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,918
um in particular an example would be a

145
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,478
Cove valent or an actual chemical bond

146
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,879
in inner spher complex formation for

147
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,719
instance May respond differently to to

148
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,680
warmer temperatures than say a weak

149
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,000
hydrophobic Association so knowing what

150
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,720
kind of mechanism is involved could be

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,839
really important for prediction of uh

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,280
future soil carbon stabilization in

153
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,638
modeling for

154
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,198
instance currently all of these

155
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,400
mechanisms that I've mentioned are have

156
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,478
mostly been determined indirectly by

157
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:19,120
absorption isotherm experiments for

158
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:22,159
example and currently they lack direct

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,120
observation and characterization in real

160
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,199
soils or in

161
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,038
situ but what we do have so far for

162
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,240
analysis of car carbon mineral

163
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,918
interfaces in soil has shown

164
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,280
unsurprisingly a very heterogeneous

165
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,959
distribution of carbon um on the scale

166
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,239
of an Aggregate and all the way down to

167
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:46,478
the scale of an actual mineral particle

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,800
so this image um shows carbon in yellow

169
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,399
and this is Nan Nano secondary ion mass

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,840
spectrometry and you can see that the

171
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,918
carbon is really distributed in in

172
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,239
discret patches and not distributed

173
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,038
evenly over the surface of the mineral

174
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,000
and

175
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,000
this patchy distribution um has also

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,800
been observed all the way down to a

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,720
single mineral surface so this presents

178
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,360
uh a pretty substantial methodological

179
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,919
challenge for observation um in terms of

180
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,720
both the spatial heterogeneity and also

181
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,799
chemical

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,840
variability so to get a little bit more

183
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,560
into the methodological challenges

184
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,318
namely spatial resolution is a huge

185
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,959
limitation so some current techniques uh

186
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,320
such as Nexa which is

187
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,079
near Edge x-ray absorption fine

188
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,039
structure which is a synchrotron based

189
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,200
technique has about a 25 to 50 nanometer

190
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:45,919
spatial resolution which is just tooo

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,000
big unbelievably seems so small uh to to

192
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,199
en Encompass the kind of variability

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,278
that we see in

194
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,040
soil also some other methodological

195
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:58,240
challenges are uh the use of a

196
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,958
stabilizing material to actually make

197
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,879
thin sections which is of often carbon

198
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,719
based so then it's really hard to see

199
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,879
carbon when you use a carbon stabilizing

200
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,160
resin uh also for instance in this study

201
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,439
mineral particles were kind of shaken up

202
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,078
and then distributed on a Surface so you

203
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,839
don't maintain the spatial distribution

204
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:19,879
in an actual Aggregate and then also in

205
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,440
general um high energy analysis using an

206
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,120
electron beam or x-rays can create

207
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,920
sample damage so these are all things

208
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,120
that have to be considered for direct

209
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,000
observation so one method uh this is now

210
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,360
what I will be focusing on for the rest

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,078
of the talk is a combination of scanning

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,600
transmission electron microscopy or stem

213
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,838
and electron energy loss spectroscopy

214
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,480
lots of acronyms eels so just really uh

215
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,360
briefly eels involves um the Electron

216
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,680
Beam from the microscope going into a

217
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,278
very thin cross-section sample and then

218
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,559
some of those electrons will just pass

219
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,639
right through and some of them will

220
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:05,000
interact with the material and then

221
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,360
scatter and so some of the scattering is

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,958
inelastic which means that it loses

223
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,759
energy and so you can measure that

224
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,838
energy loss with a spectrometer hence

225
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,039
getting electron energy loss

226
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,600
spectroscopy and that's just basically

227
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:23,919
how that works um and then when you get

228
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,560
an energy loss Spectrum you have some

229
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,360
distinctive Peaks for certain elements

230
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,000
so this is for carbon which is in

231
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,079
diamond and graphite

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,958
um but then you have a distinctive uh

233
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:38,039
Peak position and shape or the fine

234
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:40,239
structure which tells you something

235
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,759
about what that carbon is bonded to so

236
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,278
if it's bonded to oxygen it's a double

237
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,480
bond to another carbon uh

238
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,120
nitrogen you can get an idea of what

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,039
functional groups are there and what

240
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:58,240
their coordination might be this is a an

241
00:10:53,039 --> 00:11:00,879
image of um stem eels of a um Amazonian

242
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,919
Dark Earth that has biochar particles

243
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,200
but this particular image shows an

244
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,919
alumino silicate clay in red and then

245
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,360
iron oxide on the surface and you can

246
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:14,759
determine using eels that it's um

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,560
oxidized iron or iron 3 based on the

248
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,240
intensity signals which I'll be talking

249
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,799
about later so eels is a really good

250
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,919
tool for both very high resolution uh

251
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,278
ideally for a

252
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,559
um a homogeneous material the resolution

253
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,278
can be up to0 two nanometers about two

254
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:36,319
angstroms which is unbelievably high for

255
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,399
natural soils probably not that good but

256
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,480
that's kind of the idea um and then also

257
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,159
be able to get information about the the

258
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,720
chemical composition of the sample so

259
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,278
that's a really useful

260
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,040
combination so now I'd like to give an

261
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,519
overview of the main chapters or

262
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:56,519
sections of my PhD research uh so to

263
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,839
start I'm going to be compiling um a

264
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,360
library of sorts of eel Spectra for

265
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,200
a number of different soil minerals um

266
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,720
and then also common model carbon in

267
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,759
soil and then building on that uh

268
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,320
collect eels data for simplified

269
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,000
mixtures of carbon and minerals and that

270
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,199
will be designed based on specific

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,639
hypothesized interactions that have

272
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:25,879
interesting spatial uh information in a

273
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,440
in this case a simplified system where

274
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,320
the environmental variables can be

275
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,959
controlled so Redux potential or pH that

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,800
somehow may be affecting the interaction

277
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,319
mechanism and then sort of the end goal

278
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,679
or the epitome of all of this is

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:45,040
applying the technique to real soils uh

280
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:47,759
in thin sections um while importantly

281
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,958
maintaining spatial distribution in the

282
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,720
sample eliminating the use of

283
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,759
stabilizing materials or carbon resins

284
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,440
that would allow us to not be able to

285
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,240
analyze carbon and then also uh

286
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,959
minimizing sample damage

287
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,759
so I'm kind of pursuing each of these

288
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:08,078
three things uh all at once uh so I'll

289
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:11,439
show you a few aspects of each of them

290
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,919
uh and then the next steps for each as

291
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,959
well so to start uh some of the

292
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,360
standards that I've chosen uh are listed

293
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:23,759
here and they represent a range of

294
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,120
elements I specifically am also

295
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,078
analyzing volcanic soil M minerals um

296
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,159
alifan and ulite for instance um as well

297
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,000
as some other elements calcium and

298
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,559
phosphorus minerals and then similarly

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,480
for carbon uh there are many different

300
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,759
kinds of carbon present in soil as we

301
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,639
know and so I've selected a list that

302
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,519
cover a broad range of functional group

303
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,360
types and also some that are specific to

304
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,278
Black carbon um or biochar because I'm

305
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,000
in Johannes leman's

306
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,120
lab so I just like to show you a couple

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,198
of reference uh Spectra that I've

308
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,198
collected so far these are for hematite

309
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:08,159
and gerti both iron minerals hematite is

310
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:10,639
an iron oxide and gerti and iron oxy

311
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:14,039
hydroxide so each of these particles is

312
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,000
ground very fine and then um deposited

313
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,159
this this Lacy background is a is carbon

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,600
that you just deposit the materials on

315
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:24,519
and then you end up with some areas on

316
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
the edges that are are thin enough uh

317
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,320
for eels so the whole particle is going

318
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,680
to be way too thick but you can get some

319
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,720
kind of regions on the

320
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,919
edges and before I start showing a bunch

321
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,399
of Spectra that are not going to mean a

322
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,879
whole lot um I just wanted to give a

323
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,480
quick overview of some of the

324
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,159
terminology so when you're talking about

325
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,360
nexas or eels um you're talking about K

326
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:52,078
L M and N edges and these basically

327
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,159
correspond to the simplified bore model

328
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,559
of an atom uh the energy levels that you

329
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,399
can also see in your gen cam electron

330
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:04,439
configuration sort of representation so

331
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,958
you have your core electrons uh closer

332
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:12,199
to the um the nucleus that are uh your K

333
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:15,399
and L edges and those will require more

334
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:18,198
energy to be excited or to uh to move to

335
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,399
the next energy level and then out in

336
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:24,599
the outer edges you have the M and N uh

337
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,480
which are more of your veence electrons

338
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,360
uh so those require much lower

339
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,839
energy this is a just a simplified

340
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,240
schematic of an eel Spectrum so right at

341
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,480
zero you have a huge Peak called a zero

342
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,240
loss Peak which tells you uh how many

343
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,720
electrons just pass straight through

344
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,959
your sample and you want to know that

345
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,639
because you want to know that it's thin

346
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,078
enough to be able to use this technique

347
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,318
so that's a really important thing to uh

348
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,439
collect for all all of your Spectra and

349
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,278
then you have this kind of indistinct

350
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,720
bump in the low loss region and so

351
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,278
that's indicating all of the those m&amp;n

352
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,240
edges in your veilance elction

353
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:04,198
and there's a lot of overlap between

354
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,759
different elements in that region so

355
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:11,039
it's kind of hard to get really

356
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,240
uh uh qualitative information from that

357
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,318
uh but you can kind of confirm that okay

358
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,799
well I see the iron M Edge so that means

359
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:19,879
iron is definitely present here but when

360
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:22,639
you start to move out into the higher

361
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,759
energy regions um where you might be

362
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,120
looking at your carbon iron oxygen edges

363
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,800
the elements of Interest that's where

364
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,839
you start to get um an apparent Peak for

365
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,519
the core loss and then all of this fine

366
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,000
structure that tells you something about

367
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,799
uh The Binding environment of that

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,600
element so here is a um a spectrum for

369
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,919
hematite and gerti for iron so this is

370
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,240
the iron L Edge now and on initial kind

371
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,719
of observation they look fairly similar

372
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
uh

373
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,319
however even very small shifts can be

374
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,679
meaningful in terms of uh Discerning

375
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,838
between different kinds of iron so if

376
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,678
there's you know a little bit of a

377
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,919
difference in the shape of this little

378
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,679
shoulder there could be a shoulder here

379
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,038
that could vary by different kinds of

380
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,798
minerals like this very subtle shift in

381
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,679
in Peak position may be meaningful and

382
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,879
currently there isn't a whole lot of

383
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,519
information in the literature about

384
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,640
these fine distinctions between iron

385
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,279
minerals and soil so this could add a

386
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,880
really uh could add some really good

387
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:30,558
information to that this spectrum uh so

388
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,360
hematite has been image before with eels

389
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,279
so this is a a spectrum in the

390
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,879
literature so it's quite

391
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,480
similar and also which has been pretty

392
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,640
well established is that the ratio of L3

393
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,960
and L2 these two peaks is um a function

394
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,320
of the sample oxidized to reduce iron

395
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,880
content so that's really convenient and

396
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,960
that's how we can use eels to kind of

397
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,840
discern iron 3 and iron 2 so there's a

398
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,360
pretty uh pretty consistent Rel

399
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,279
relationship between the the ratio of

400
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,479
those Peaks so you could have hematite

401
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,599
which is theoretically 100% oxidized

402
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,679
iron and then something like fite which

403
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:15,879
is theoretically 0% oxidized iron and be

404
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:19,200
able to kind of map in this spectrum um

405
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,360
a wide variety of different redo States

406
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,759
in Iron which is really a useful

407
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:28,158
tool for oxygen you can see that the

408
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,079
Spectrum starts to Look a Lot Messier um

409
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,320
which really takes away a lot of the

410
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,480
conclusions you can draw from it but

411
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,279
there is a pretty um apparent difference

412
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,558
between the ratio of A and B in this

413
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,079
spectrum and it turns out that that is

414
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,599
related to the uh degree of oxidation

415
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,240
and this is also a very consistent

416
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,959
predictable Trend so you can use that to

417
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,359
determine the iron oxygen ratio which is

418
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,200
another really useful

419
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,839
tool and finally for hematite and gerti

420
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,240
this is the veence region the really low

421
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:04,079
loss so starting

422
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,640
just above zero um up to about 60 and so

423
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,359
there isn't a whole lot of really great

424
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,600
information here you have carbon coming

425
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,879
from the grid that we prepared the

426
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,038
samples on but you do have an iron M

427
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,559
edge here so that's really good for as

428
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,440
like an independent confirmation that

429
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,440
iron is present and we might be able to

430
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,798
get some information from that as

431
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,279
well so just quickly uh two other uh

432
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,960
minerals that we've analyzed so far are

433
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,000
Gibs site and hydroxy appetite so

434
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,360
looking at aluminum calcium and

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,200
phosphorus aluminum is really hard to

436
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:38,199
get um EOS Spectrum for because it is in

437
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,159
the low loss range and as I mentioned

438
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,840
there's a lot of overlap there uh so

439
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,240
that's a challenge um which is a little

440
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,720
unfortunate because aluminum of course

441
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,038
is very common in soil and a very

442
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,079
important part of of mineral

443
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,000
interactions and just quickly this is a

444
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,158
list of the remaining elements or the

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,679
remaining um minerals that I have to

446
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,440
analyze as I mentioned some volcanic

447
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:05,038
minerals alifan and aite some kind of

448
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,840
normal crystallin uh Clays and then also

449
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,319
iron oxides that represent that range of

450
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,319
um Iron

451
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,200
oxidation and we have started working on

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
some carbon standards an issue with that

453
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,400
is uh they're much less resistant to

454
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,359
damage from the Electron Beam than iron

455
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,798
minerals and also um typically when you

456
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,359
have any sample that goes into the

457
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,480
microscope you have to clean it with a

458
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,599
plas an oxygen plasma before it goes in

459
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,480
so that it doesn't contaminate with just

460
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,879
things floating around in the microscope

461
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,679
but of course these are carbon compounds

462
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,520
and cleaning them with plasma would kind

463
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,679
of just burn them away which would be

464
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,000
kind of useless so we don't have a good

465
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,759
way to clean them and so this ends up

466
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,079
posing a huge problem with carbon

467
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:55,200
contamination so in order to get around

468
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:57,480
that we're working on uh doing eels at

469
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,080
very low temperature called cryo eels

470
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,240
which helps eliminate carbon

471
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,599
contamination and then also using

472
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,038
alternative sample cleaning uh one

473
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,798
example is critical point

474
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:12,599
drying so next I'm just going to give a

475
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,759
quick overview of um my proposed work um

476
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,119
in these simplified mixtures this isn't

477
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,119
something that I've started yet so I'd

478
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:21,079
be glad to hear any input you might have

479
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,158
in in this or suggestions and so

480
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,720
basically these are going to be uh

481
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,200
simplified systems in a kind of a

482
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,278
classic absorption isotherm type

483
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,880
approach um based on some specific

484
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,278
hypothesized interactions and Then

485
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
followed by analysis of the particles

486
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:40,200
themselves with eels to see if we can

487
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:42,400
kind of really unequivocally um

488
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,840
determine what is going on at that

489
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,120
interface so this is just one example of

490
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:50,759
one of my proposed combinations so this

491
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:54,359
would be using a a polar carbon shown

492
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:57,079
here just generically as a RC and a

493
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,038
non-polar carbon with a generic carbon

494
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,960
chain uh and

495
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:05,440
Amite another again one of the volcanic

496
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,519
minerals so one hypothesis is that the

497
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,600
polar carbon will be involved in Cove

498
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:14,639
valent bonding but only at the edges or

499
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,278
the the ends of the emite tube or at

500
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,559
broken SES on the surface and that the

501
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:23,400
non non-polar carbon may not interact at

502
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:25,440
all or it could uh be involved in some

503
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,519
kind of secondary association with the

504
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
polar carbon so just to give you an idea

505
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,278
of the spatial distribution that we

506
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,558
might see you could see just polar

507
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:36,038
carbon at the ends and nonpolar carbon

508
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,678
not associated at all we could see it

509
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:41,640
everywhere or just in broken sites and

510
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,679
non-polar not associated or non-polar

511
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,480
could go to the ends or it could cover

512
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,640
the whole thing so there are lots of

513
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,440
different uh possibilities here um but

514
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,200
what is great about this technique is

515
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,080
that we'll be able to see you know a

516
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,679
difference between this carbon and this

517
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,519
carbon and be able to assign where it is

518
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,919
spatially in this system which is really

519
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,918
useful and then next uh one of the

520
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,640
proposed incubations or absorption

521
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,720
experiments would involve a sequence of

522
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,480
reducing conditions and oxidizing

523
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,319
conditions reducing oxidizing reducing

524
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,919
oxidizing to try to um encourage iron

525
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,879
co-precipitation with carbon so there

526
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,200
has been some a recent work about

527
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,840
spatial differences between carbon

528
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,640
that's just absorb to the surface of

529
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,678
oxidized iron versus carbon that's just

530
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,480
physically intercalated in the structure

531
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,880
of a um a co-precipitate between iron

532
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,360
and carbon so this is just something

533
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,720
that has a really interesting spatial

534
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,558
characteristic which is really the

535
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,798
benefit of the technique that I'm using

536
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,240
so it's important to select things that

537
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,240
have some kind of interesting spatial

538
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,839
information so finally I'm going to show

539
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:03,519
you some preliminary results from actual

540
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,839
analysis of real soils which is kind of

541
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,240
the ultimate goal of this work as I

542
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,839
mentioned earlier the main challenges

543
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,120
here are preventing damage to the sample

544
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,678
um eliminating that carbon resin

545
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,119
maintaining the spatial distribution

546
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,400
within an Aggregate and then also being

547
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,319
able to analyze both carbon and the

548
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,360
mineral chemistry and so similarly to

549
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,158
the cryo eels I mentioned for analyzing

550
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:31,599
the carbon standards we're going to be

551
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,159
us using cryo FIB or focused ion beam

552
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:37,519
Milling to prepare the samples and

553
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,278
hopefully this will um account for a few

554
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,918
of the methodological considerations and

555
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,839
Then followed by that we'll be using

556
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,480
cryo eel so everything is Frozen from

557
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:51,000
beginning to end um in water which is a

558
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,720
more natural uh Matrix than carbon resin

559
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and as you might have guessed my initial

560
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,759
soil samples will be from volcanic soils

561
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,519
um from a model ecosystem with mineral

562
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,319
control on carbon

563
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,679
turnover so just a quick overview uh the

564
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:06,599
soils that I'm using right now are

565
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,360
collected from Hawaii by uh

566
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,798
collaborators Katie Grant who's here and

567
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,199
Lou Derry and Earth and atmospheric

568
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:18,158
sciences uh this particular sample um is

569
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,319
characterized as a wiia silt Loom and

570
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,080
it's about uh in the middle range of

571
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:27,480
soil age around 350,000 years old and so

572
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,319
it's characterized by those uh short

573
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,200
range ordered or semic crystallin

574
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,079
minerals that I mentioned

575
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,880
earlier so these are some uh scanning

576
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,359
electron microscope images just of

577
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,520
intact Aggregates just to give you an

578
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,079
idea what they look like and how

579
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,000
variable they are um so you can see that

580
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,480
you know you have some that are kind of

581
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,679
uh lumpy and some that are kind of

582
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,319
smooth some that are stretched out so

583
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,320
even in the aggregate shape there's a

584
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,639
lot of

585
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,439
variability these were collected from

586
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,679
deeper soils and also from A system that

587
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,558
has relatively high iron and carbon

588
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,798
content and they are well drained so

589
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:08,440
they're probably dominated by oxidized

590
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:11,639
iron I selected uh Aggregates in the

591
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,600
range of about 53 to 150 Micron diameter

592
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,559
so microaggregates and this is

593
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,918
for ease of analysis it's just a better

594
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:22,440
size to use and also these

595
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,720
microaggregates may have um really

596
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,000
stable uh mineral

597
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,759
interactions so this is a little cartoon

598
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,398
of

599
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,079
how we start to section the Aggregates

600
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:38,158
uh so first they're hydrated uh slowly

601
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:40,119
with a um a humidifier and then just

602
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,640
dropped in a little bead of water flash

603
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,839
frozen in liquid nitrogen and then cut

604
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,960
into sections using a cryo Ultram

605
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,839
microtome or a diamond blade just a

606
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,558
little and then it ends up on a copper

607
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,319
Grid in a thin section that still has

608
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,440
ice around it and it stays

609
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:00,918
Frozen so then uh if you can visualize

610
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,480
this is now that grid looking from above

611
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,080
so each of these little blobs are

612
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,679
sections of carbon so you can see

613
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,119
they're kind of variable um but if you

614
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:14,200
were to look at them from the side they

615
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,599
are actually relatively uh flat on both

616
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,720
sides amazingly it's a really

617
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,079
interesting technique and they kind of

618
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,000
cover a range of shapes um some of them

619
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,359
kind of break apart on natural uh

620
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,398
breaking points some of them look like

621
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,319
pork chops I think some of them look

622
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:30,599
like tacos but then you have to find the

623
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,359
one that just looks just right and

624
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,359
that's the one you go

625
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:39,038
with so then after you have your perfect

626
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,039
sections that you want to try to look at

627
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,798
you then uh in the FIB uh which is the

628
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:47,079
focused ion beam you have a beam of

629
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:50,639
gallium ions that come down at an

630
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:53,398
angle and kind of cut out a wedge out of

631
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,519
the out of the sample so you end up with

632
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,278
a really thin area at the bottom and

633
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,319
then just sort of the normal sample

634
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:02,319
thickness at the top and you can see

635
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,720
that in each of these images here we

636
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,519
have um our our wedges with only the

637
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,278
very edge of the sample probably thin

638
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,240
enough for eels so it's getting down to

639
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:13,319
a really small area for analysis and so

640
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,159
you kind of have to get a little bit

641
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,839
lucky that you catch a really

642
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,840
interesting feature in that tiny

643
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,559
area but we fortunately did last week um

644
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,159
and hopefully more to come um so this is

645
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:30,359
just some some very preliminary results

646
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,799
for uh some of our initial Imaging so

647
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,918
this is just one of those sections and

648
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,879
then one of a tiny area of one of these

649
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,559
sections then blown up much bigger um

650
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,399
and then this tiny area blown up bigger

651
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:48,798
here and then finally a um Elemental map

652
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,759
of that region so this is a electron

653
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,839
dispersive x-ray so it's a very coarse

654
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:56,679
Scale map but you can see that uh we

655
00:28:53,839 --> 00:29:00,720
have carbon which is exciting and you

656
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,399
can see this area here is relatively uh

657
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,839
homogeneous carbon which is nice it's

658
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,158
not mixed up with a lot of other

659
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:09,639
elements and then we have a particle of

660
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,120
that of mostly aluminum it also has

661
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,600
oxygen no silicon so it's probably an

662
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,599
aluminum

663
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
oxide however this is a little bit of a

664
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,159
problem we also have gallium where could

665
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,959
that have come from of course the uh the

666
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,919
gallium ion beam right so uh gallium

667
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,720
likes to uh deposit itself on the sample

668
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,159
sometimes uh so this is just something

669
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,319
we need to be aware of um and make sure

670
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,039
that it's not changing our signals too

671
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,480
substantially you'll notice though that

672
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,839
it's really concentrated in the aluminum

673
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,038
area and hardly any signal at all in the

674
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,639
carbon which is nice because then we can

675
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,879
be able to analyze the carbon without

676
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,559
worrying about gallium um but this is

677
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,039
something we need to consider for future

678
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:57,240
analyses so now going even smaller we

679
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:02,599
have this area of carbon and aluminum

680
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:05,440
blown up to a STM image or stem image so

681
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:07,519
this is your carbon here and then um

682
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,120
each of the areas of different contrast

683
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,240
are

684
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,678
higher um higher atomic weight elements

685
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,960
so they show up differently and then

686
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,320
even more uh magnification we then have

687
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,600
carbon and we can start to see this

688
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:25,119
interface with um a mineral that we have

689
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:27,678
putatively determin as

690
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,278
aluminum and then even one more image

691
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,880
this is the highest resolution I have we

692
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,319
have carbon and then this kind of fuzzy

693
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,240
but still kind of distinct interface so

694
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:40,879
just something to to note here uh This

695
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,240
scalebar Is 50 nanometers um so when I

696
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,240
mentioned nexs that the resolution is 25

697
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,159
to 50

698
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,558
nanometers just imagine that half of

699
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,679
this or the whole thing is just one

700
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,319
whole pixel so this is a much better

701
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,320
spatial resolution already even at just

702
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,918
this scale than we could get with NEX

703
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,918
apps which is a really exciting thing

704
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:07,000
also exciting uh we collected a a carbon

705
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:09,000
kedge eel Spectrum from this area to my

706
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,519
knowledge the first in real soil without

707
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,278
a carbon resin so it's kind of an

708
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:16,679
exciting day um it's not a particularly

709
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,679
distinctive Spectrum but there are a few

710
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,360
things that even just with very

711
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,559
preliminary uh analysis we can start to

712
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:28,599
see so there's no Peak at

713
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:32,200
285 which is characteristic of aromatic

714
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:35,678
carbon um and very consistent across all

715
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,840
types of carbon for nexafs which is

716
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,720
mostly related to eel's data um we do

717
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:46,959
have these two kind of indistinct prep

718
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,319
Peaks at about 287 and 289 um EV and

719
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,600
they could really be a whole bunch of

720
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,638
different things um could be shift of

721
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,398
aromatic carbon with an oxygen or a

722
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:59,439
nitrogen um or could be aliphatic carbon

723
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:02,319
289 could be uh carboxilic acids or

724
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,558
amines or alcohols so you can see the

725
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,678
value of determining the carbon

726
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,359
reference library and being in analyzing

727
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,240
real soils because we can really start

728
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,638
to link these Peaks and their

729
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,038
characteristics with known functional

730
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:20,398
groups we also have

731
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,119
a uh a line scan uh which basically

732
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:27,158
takes points along a line that

733
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:31,678
you uh draw on the image uh so we can

734
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:35,360
start to kind of get a range across a a

735
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,120
gradient so first in the adjacent carbon

736
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,519
region this is the Spectrum I just

737
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,558
showed and then starting to get closer

738
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,038
to the edge you can see that the

739
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,079
Spectrum starts to get a lot Messier um

740
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:47,278
lots of variability here and that's

741
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,319
because it starts to get thicker as you

742
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,079
get closer to the mineral so as we

743
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:54,359
continue to prepare more samples we

744
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,759
really want to try to maximize the the

745
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,079
thinness of the of the sample um it's

746
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,240
just going to continue to be something

747
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,599
to work on but you can already see that

748
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,038
there are some differences um

749
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:08,079
potentially in the relationship of those

750
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:12,200
first two preps just out at this Outer

751
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:14,359
Edge and then at a point closer to the

752
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,440
interface uh there's there are quite a

753
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:19,319
few new new small Peaks um lots of

754
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,240
variability uh this is going to take a

755
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:24,158
lot of analysis to get what might be

756
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,558
meaningful out of the spectrum and then

757
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,360
of course the more uh the less signal to

758
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,879
noise ratio we can get the better it

759
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,839
will be at being able to pull out

760
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,080
features of these Spectra and then

761
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,558
finally one more on the other side um

762
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:41,960
and you can see that the the first

763
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,519
prepak is almost gone so the meaning of

764
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,240
this is going to take a lot of analysis

765
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,599
but it's kind of an exciting development

766
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,399
to see that there are

767
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,599
differences across this uh mineral

768
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:54,599
carbon

769
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,199
region so just to wrap up um the next

770
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,240
things that I'm going to be working on

771
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,240
continued sample preparation

772
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,278
uh for the thin sections continued

773
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,638
analysis and then working on linking

774
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:09,239
carbon compound chemistry and the

775
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:12,000
interface and then just in general uh

776
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,479
continuing to analyze standards the

777
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,878
simplified mixture experiments um and

778
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,159
then lots and lots and lots of data

779
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,878
analysis forever and ever to get

780
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,519
meaningful information from this from

781
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,878
this data so I just like to acknowledge

782
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,398
my funding which is from the cross scale

783
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,199
bio geochemistry and climate igit and

784
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,000
then also also we've been working with

785
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,158
the Cornell Center for materials

786
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,280
research which is uh a really really

787
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,960
essential piece of this we would

788
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,159
definitely not be able to do it without

789
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,159
our collaborators in physics David

790
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,679
Mueller who works with eels and Lena

791
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,440
fitting kudus who does uh fib and then

792
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,358
their grad students have collected a lot

793
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,599
of this data with me and have been

794
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,519
really really helpful um also my thesis

795
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,960
committee U my adviser Johannes Leman

796
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,358
who's not here today unfortunately um

797
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,480
and then also we've gotten lots of

798
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,319
support support from my lab and the

799
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,880
support staff at the

800
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,039
ccmr so there are tons and tons of

801
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,920
really interesting resources which

802
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,400
obviously you can't read but if you ever

803
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,039
want to talk to about where any I got

804
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,920
any of this information from I'd be glad

805
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,320
to discuss it further and finally uh

806
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,720
thank you so much for your attention do

807
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,720
you have any

808
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,400
questions this has been a production of

809
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:30,800
Cornell University on the web at

810
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,800
cornell.edu you
