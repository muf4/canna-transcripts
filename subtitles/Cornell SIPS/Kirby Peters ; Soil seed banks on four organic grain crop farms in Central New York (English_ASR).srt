1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:15,570
okay next up today we have Kirby Peters

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:18,299
Kirby is from Roxbury Connecticut he

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,449
worked with Matt Ryan Jeff Lee Bert and

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,660
Sandra women in soil and crop science

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,939
and his post graduation plans are to be

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,118
a greenhouse manager at Johnson backyard

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,600
garden in Austin Texas the title of

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,390
Kirby's seminar is soil to see soil seed

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,429
banks on for organic grain crop farms in

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,009
central New York okay so over on again

13
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,570
my name is Kirby Peters I'm an

14
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,329
agricultural science student graduating

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,969
a few weeks and the title of my project

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,399
I'll be presenting you today is the soil

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,558
seed banks on for organic grain crop

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,859
farms in central New York and my thesis

19
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,089
advisor again was Matt Matthew Ryan so

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,309
first I'm going to give you a quick

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,109
little outline of the project what we've

22
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,670
heard from several farmers that we know

23
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,760
is that red clover had been identified

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,189
as a volunteer crop on several its own

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,868
farms and so what we decided to do was a

26
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,508
sample the weed seed bank in order to

27
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:17,009
identify if this was truly there was

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,859
truly a red clover seed bank within

29
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,079
there within the soil so we measured is

30
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,060
the weed seed density the weed species

31
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:25,438
richness the red clover density and

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,820
lastly we looked at the we chief

33
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,828
community as a whole so first I think

34
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,828
we're talking what a soil DC bank is and

35
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,949
it's just a vial viable seed in the soil

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,328
that has a potential to germinate red

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,728
clover specifically is what we're

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,319
looking at and this is extremely common

39
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,090
in organic agriculture mainly because

40
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,669
organic agriculture connected synthetic

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,990
inputs so organic growers tend to rely

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,460
on biological biological inputs such as

43
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,989
our clover because it's a legume and it

44
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,019
can fix nitrogen to the soil with its

45
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,310
symbiotic relationship with bacteria so

46
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,629
as you can see here here's a picture of

47
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,060
a clover in case unit now it's nice

48
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:07,408
drawing and like I said a lot of a few

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,868
growers have mentions that they have

50
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,510
seen this crop as a volunteer crop and

51
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:14,430
what that means is basically the crop

52
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,979
has persisted past its time of the

53
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,780
rotation so clover can be frost seeded

54
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,959
or can also be seen in the fall go

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,750
through the winter and then

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,170
emerge in the spring and that's great

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,520
and all its unterminated in order to

58
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:29,829
take room from the for the crops that

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,980
could be a grain as as we like to say

60
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,050
wheat but the issue with a volunteer

61
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:38,199
crop is then it persists past that and

62
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,410
then it's still present in your crop so

63
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,269
many people see this as a negative as a

64
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,099
negative implication because you have

65
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,290
this described clover that's competing

66
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,299
with your crop for a lot of resources

67
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:52,599
whether it be nutrients sunlight or

68
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,719
water however this study conflicts it in

69
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,219
perspective this study looks at the

70
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,759
possible benefit of this volunteer works

71
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:02,020
over I mean there's many benefits to red

72
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,819
clover itself like I said it fixes

73
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,469
nitrogen however if we don't have to

74
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,109
seed red clover there's just this like

75
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:10,930
natural odor clover seed bank you can

76
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,300
save seed costs that's less less labor

77
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,340
you don't make a trip into the field to

78
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,530
broadcast you can also potentially

79
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,659
control the emergence of your red clover

80
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,539
this is beneficial because there's times

81
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,740
for example wet times of the year when

82
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:26,139
you cannot get into your field because

83
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,060
too wet however if you have this red

84
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,029
clover seed bank it'll come up anyways

85
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,319
so that's always a nice benefit so in

86
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,699
order to look at this red clover what we

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,189
did is we looked at it within the

88
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,599
context of the whole beet seed bank so

89
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,039
from there we decided just to make a

90
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,949
characterization the whole of the whole

91
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,449
beet seed bank itself so we did is we

92
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,699
did the study over two years this

93
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,089
happened this occurred in 2015 and so

94
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,250
them 16 we sampled four farms these

95
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,849
farmers are chosen from our Advisory

96
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,229
Board in our lab these are pretty

97
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,500
experienced organic growers these

98
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:04,000
organic growers that have that were some

99
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,919
of the first organic growers in the

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,370
state so when I say they're experienced

101
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,599
there they're very curious and so we're

102
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,730
thankful for them to volunteer for the

103
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,159
study what we did is we asked each

104
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,750
farmer to pick three fields they're

105
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,608
clean field I hike lower field and a

106
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,529
weedy field the idea what this is when

107
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,389
they chose for example had clover fields

108
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,509
it would be identifying a field with a

109
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,610
boatful receipt banks present it when

110
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:29,439
farmers were choosing their clean fields

111
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,020
generally or they're picking fields that

112
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,860
they observed

113
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,329
we'd abundance in at least above ground

114
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,419
but also they talked about how conducive

115
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,029
fields were for control someone farmer

116
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:45,478
mission to fry delegated soil as making

117
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:47,788
it more conducive for control for hog

118
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,500
clover fields farmers talked about

119
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,199
basically the presence it had in their

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,300
rotation but also all the farms were

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,680
harvesting red clover and for these

122
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,788
fields they said they noticed that a lot

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,949
of seed was dropping down to the soil

124
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:02,519
adding some red clover seed into the

125
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,500
soil seed bank and lastly low B D field

126
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,418
farmers chose this generally because

127
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,209
they had observed a high amount of

128
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,258
abundance in these fields and also they

129
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,899
talked about how some of these fields

130
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,189
were not so conducive for control so

131
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,688
some farmers talked about field thing

132
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,400
really wet and that kind of preventing

133
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:21,090
them in getting into the fields and

134
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,158
controlling weeds so here's just an

135
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,198
example this is the Potenza farm so you

136
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:27,089
can see he chose his weedy field here

137
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,960
his high clover field and lastly it's

138
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:33,359
clean field and then from there we did

139
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,680
our soil sampling and we split each

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,990
field into four quadrants and then we

141
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,908
sampled each quadrant soil sampling was

142
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,418
done an early spring before any wheats

143
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:48,319
had emerged as you can see here there

144
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,189
are no weeds present no weeds here and

145
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,490
soil sampling with some of the soil

146
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:56,399
probe this is what you see here and here

147
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,509
we would go 8 inches down the diameter

148
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:03,838
of the probe was about 5/8 of an inch

149
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:06,210
and we did so 30 soil cores per quadrant

150
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:08,459
and then from there what we would do

151
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,079
with the 30 soil cores if we would

152
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,750
combine them in a bucket as you see here

153
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,500
to make one composite sample per

154
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,069
quadrant so all in all we would have we

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,990
had four farms three fields and four

156
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,848
quadrants that was about 48 samples for

157
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,228
one year and after two years we did 90

158
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:29,908
96 samples so once we had that composite

159
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:32,610
sample what we did is we performed a

160
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:34,680
greenhouse termination by LSA this is

161
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,569
what you see here we would take one

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,908
kilogram of soil from each of those

163
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,348
composite samples and put them into one

164
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,550
of these traits so each sample was

165
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:43,469
representative and what in one of these

166
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,470
traits we go

167
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,750
Wow the weed seed in the soil to

168
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,790
germinate and then once we were able to

169
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,329
identify we would identify them count

170
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:57,090
them and then remove them and we would

171
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:59,310
identify them by distance species so

172
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,319
what we would do this is just an example

173
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,970
so once these had germinated we would

174
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,829
then identify them count them and remove

175
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,130
them that's considered one flush and we

176
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:10,859
did two flushes so after we identified

177
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,409
counted removed we then sir well-mixed

178
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,470
watered hopes to hopefully stimulate

179
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,120
some more germination of bloom species

180
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,400
and then again what the let them

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,389
germinate identified and remove them so

182
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,789
that's why we call two pushes in order

183
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,279
to analyze this data we use analysis of

184
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,200
variance or ANOVA and then to compare

185
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,719
the means we use the two keys Kraemer

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,189
method we analyze like it's in the

187
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,010
beginning we see density which is just

188
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:40,410
the total amount of weeds we feeling for

189
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:43,110
the observed weed species richness which

190
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,439
is the amount of species per farm or per

191
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,639
field varied clover density which is the

192
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,319
amount of October seedlings we

193
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,269
identified and then lastly the lead seek

194
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:56,810
community which is just looking at the

195
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:59,039
all the species and abundance you know

196
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,959
so first one were looking at here is the

197
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,819
blue tea density we observed you can see

198
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,549
our responsible is the soil we ttank

199
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,978
density per seedlings of ceilings per

200
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,449
meter squared it's important to

201
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:11,430
acknowledge that we compared with in

202
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,069
farms so we just compared the weedy hug

203
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,500
clover and cool and then each farm the

204
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:18,839
different letters indicate a significant

205
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,360
difference the NFP representing no

206
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,668
significant difference so it may take

207
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,189
ways from this is we saw a very large

208
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:28,409
range of we see densities so you can see

209
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:31,279
in the Martins high clover field in 2015

210
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,200
right here there was about three hundred

211
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,679
seedlings I done per meter squared

212
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,620
identified and then into them 16 in the

213
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,809
Austin era high clover field you can see

214
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,480
when it was a much larger it was a

215
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:48,539
hundred three thousand seedlings so this

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,690
is a very large range and then the next

217
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:53,219
thing we took away from this was that

218
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,300
almost all the really fields had higher

219
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,310
C densities than the clean fields

220
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,750
see here and here except for the one

221
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,179
example that we didn't see this was in

222
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,799
the Meijer farm in 2015 where there's no

223
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:07,969
significant difference between any of

224
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:09,859
the fields next we're looking at a low

225
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,149
weed species richness it's important to

226
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,490
acknowledge we're not looking in a area

227
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:18,828
variable now now we're looking in a mass

228
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,220
so we're looking at species richness per

229
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:24,949
species per Atilla gram this is a little

230
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,259
more variable however between years it

231
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,060
stays fairly constant so you can see

232
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:30,828
here in Martin's the weedy field had a

233
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,739
higher species richness than the clean

234
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:35,509
field in both years for my or seed

235
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,278
consistent no significant difference

236
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,838
between any of the fields

237
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,850
same thing with ocean air you can see

238
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,890
the BD field there was an observed

239
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,700
difference between the weedy field and

240
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:48,470
the high and the clean field and the

241
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,649
little bit of variance we saw was to mid

242
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:54,139
Potenza field and in the farm where he

243
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:57,110
saw the weedy field had a higher version

244
00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:00,490
of spend the clean field however we need

245
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,850
to observe any difference in to them 16

246
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,019
so lastly we have the red clover density

247
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,810
this wasn't there wasn't as much

248
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,159
variation you can see here there was we

249
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,229
observe any difference in the Myers and

250
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,069
the Martins farm between fields same

251
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,450
thing with Potenza however we did notice

252
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,410
we saw a quite a bit of difference in

253
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,360
the Meyer farm we're in 2015 and 2016

254
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:27,409
the weedy fields had a higher red clover

255
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,629
density than the clean fields and same

256
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,278
with the high clover the only other

257
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,350
difference we saw was in the Oscar farm

258
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,769
in 2015 where the weedy field had a

259
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:41,930
higher regular density than both the

260
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:44,120
high clover and clean so now we're

261
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,519
looking at the lead will be called a

262
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,810
looot seed bank community data this is

263
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,828
just the species that make up the top

264
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:54,309
75% of the abundance from each farm so

265
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:57,139
as you can see here we have the total

266
00:10:54,309 --> 00:11:00,198
amount abundance of the of the total

267
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,278
wheat seed bank community so what we

268
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:04,519
notice from this is that there was a lot

269
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:07,039
of overlap of species between farms you

270
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,399
can see paths rush here and paths across

271
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,589
here

272
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,139
you see sleeping species the main

273
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,240
species yeah there's a few wood sorrel

274
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,439
and other wood sorrel there there's some

275
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,539
commonality in a lot of farms

276
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,810
however there were specific species that

277
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,939
were common on all farms or the majority

278
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,579
of farms and some of these examples

279
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,080
where personal expedia you can see it

280
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,000
made of a high percentage of martin's in

281
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,980
the ocean air farm it was a lower

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,460
percentage on the Pens of farm however

283
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,139
it was still present there the next

284
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,509
example is giant Fox scale which we

285
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:42,179
found on a lot of farms on very and very

286
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:45,259
high percentages which you can see in

287
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,759
the Myers Potenza and Martin's farm and

288
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,309
lastly red clover wasn't necessarily a

289
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,559
common species amongst all farms however

290
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,139
just for the sake of this project and we

291
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,789
should point it out you can see in the

292
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,980
Martins farm wait about three percent of

293
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:02,219
the total abundance of weed seed was our

294
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,340
clover but what's really interesting in

295
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,600
Myers farm we had about 18 percent of

296
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,190
the total wheat seed bank density was

297
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,960
red clover which is a hot which is a

298
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,670
high amount of what we observed so now

299
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,519
we're looking at the 2016 not let's just

300
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:20,279
changed you can still see the same

301
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,569
similar common species giant rock so for

302
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,559
example still present in these three

303
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,950
farms a huge increase 43 percent of the

304
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,449
seed bank is now a giant foxtail but

305
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,660
yeah once again it's still present in

306
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:36,680
the Martin's and that's apartment

307
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:39,240
red clover you can see it now has

308
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,239
disappeared from the top 76% of the

309
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:47,340
Martins farm they decreased by half and

310
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:50,399
the Myers farm or from 18% to 9% and now

311
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,639
it is present in the protective arm so

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,919
there's a variation there so from some

313
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,949
conclusions forms project the first we

314
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,519
saw the majority the weedy fields had a

315
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:05,340
higher seed bank density than the clean

316
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,289
fields which so which suggests that

317
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:12,540
there's some support which behind the

318
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:13,740
farmers picking of each field what's

319
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,779
really interesting is we found the

320
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,470
presence of red clover in the seed bank

321
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,329
in many of the fields so we found the

322
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,120
red clover at less present in 22 of the

323
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,290
24 field

324
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,690
over the two years the density ranges

325
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:31,269
from zero to four thousand shillings per

326
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,060
meter squared and then lastly we saw

327
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,460
some we saw in certain farms that red

328
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:37,059
clover I made up a large percentage of

329
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,860
the wheat seed bank

330
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:42,939
so for example in the Myers farm they

331
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,379
made of eighteen percent and then lastly

332
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,110
our last conclusion is that there were

333
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:48,879
common species amongst the majority of

334
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,919
farms or all farms and those species

335
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,720
were giant foxtail pigweed species with

336
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,729
several species for same speed well

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,779
common lamb's-quarter and common ragweed

338
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,460
and this is this adds to some research

339
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,169
that we've already seen where these

340
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,070
species have been identified as promise

341
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:08,889
species in organic systems so the next

342
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,450
steps to take from this project would be

343
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,870
to determine management practices that

344
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:17,370
would support the or promote the

345
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,919
persistence of red clover seed banks

346
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,240
we've seen we know this is volunteering

347
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,649
we've also heard from any farmers to the

348
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,259
recs are utilizing this volunteer crop

349
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,730
so it's important that we start

350
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:32,500
investigating other other methods and

351
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:34,360
ways of managing red clover but also in

352
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,769
the context of this study it's important

353
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,039
to explore differences differences

354
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:41,370
between farms so for example in the

355
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,959
Myers farm we saw there very high

356
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,360
ultimate very high we saw high levels of

357
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,889
red clover compared to other farms and

358
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,269
it would just be good to explore the

359
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:51,460
differences in terms of management to

360
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,590
see why they have such higher levels and

361
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,210
how we could use those those manager

362
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,950
practices and other in other firms so

363
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,940
this this project without the possible

364
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,620
of course without the sustainable

365
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:08,050
cropping systems lab led by Matt Ryan my

366
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,730
great friend Jeff Siebert Sondra Wayman

367
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,289
Chris Pelzer and of course the poor

368
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,060
farmers that participate in this project

369
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,849
and then other people who just helped me

370
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:17,669
with presentation editing my thesis and

371
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:23,100
as well just other suggestions and

372
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:23,099
helpful guiding lessons spit thank you

373
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:35,859
practice scientific name yeah so I mean

374
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,570
I presented common names just because I

375
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,839
thought it'd be easier for the

376
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,730
presentation sake but no it is pretty

377
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:59,649
common to use scientific names for for

378
00:15:42,730 --> 00:16:01,600
speeches or identifying yeah yes so we

379
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,429
saw we saw there was more annuals and

380
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,709
perennials for sure but there were some

381
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,349
perennials for example wood sorrel was

382
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:10,708
common we found that all farms but at

383
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,839
very low levels about like three percent

384
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:15,819
besides that I applaud my head I can't

385
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,029
think of any that were common amongst

386
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,390
all farms but the majority were Raynald

387
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,389
yeah

388
00:16:25,649 --> 00:17:12,209
oh there's Jeff yeah so your first

389
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,109
question

390
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,788
remind me okay yes so for the for the

391
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,379
project for the for the paper at least

392
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:21,778
I'm writing I didn't present it here but

393
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,760
we have taken soil health data from each

394
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:26,880
farm so that sometimes we can we can

395
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,169
look at and analyze further so this is

396
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,610
what for people don't know soil health

397
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:32,399
two tests are just comprehensive tests

398
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:34,589
of biological factors chemical factors

399
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:39,359
and physical factors so soil structure

400
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:46,199
chemical pH one so you have that and

401
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:49,678
then your second question I'm sorry yeah

402
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,669
so it's an yet it's hard nitrogen it's

403
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,080
important have it balanced because

404
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,700
there's there's plenty of studies that

405
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,259
have shown that if you have exercises in

406
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,179
weeds are way more competitive at

407
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:01,798
digging up that nitrogen than crops so

408
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:05,220
it's really important but in general red

409
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:08,158
clover as a biological source of

410
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,980
nitrogen is fairly good at just staying

411
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,510
available for for crops just cuz that

412
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,120
it's not immediately available

413
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:18,778
necessarily if you incorporate as a

414
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,949
green manure well that's that's just the

415
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:22,730
gist I know there's probably a little

416
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,730
more complex than that

417
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:35,299
this really feels really factory how you

418
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:48,740
permanently help our factory on a new

419
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:50,930
core of the field yeah so I mean it

420
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,120
would be I think a longer term study

421
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,799
would be I would be great we only did

422
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,289
two years so we were only to see a

423
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,710
certain certain time period and there's

424
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:02,960
certain a few studies suggests that the

425
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,340
longer it takes a while for its

426
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,279
perceived bank space to adjust to

427
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:09,529
certain management practices so

428
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,450
unfortunately we don't necessarily see

429
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:12,889
that long-term effects of management it

430
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,809
was really have the dip to two years

431
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,660
however we have gone back and we've gone

432
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:20,299
about seven to four years back of

433
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,500
managerial practices from each farmer so

434
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,450
yeah we haven't even present it in this

435
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,799
but that is something we have been

436
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,860
looking at does that answer your

437
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,859
question

438
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:41,289
this has been a production of Cornell

439
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:41,289
