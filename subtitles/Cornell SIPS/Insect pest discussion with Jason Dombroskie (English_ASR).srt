1
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:06,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,719
University for those of you that don't

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:18,600
know me uh my name is Jason and I am the

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,358
coordinator for the insect Diagnostic

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,519
lab and the collection manager for the

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,760
Cornell University insect collection uh

7
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,079
so the two jobs wrapped into one uh what

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,480
I'll do over the next uh little while is

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,640
is discuss some of the things that I've

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,920
been getting uh over the past few months

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,079
in here um that might be of interest to

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,840
you and then I'm I'm very keen to hear

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,000
what you've been getting um and I'd be

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,600
Keen to get any questions that you might

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,558
have uh so don't be shy uh there's no

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,960
such thing is a stupid question I get a

17
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,238
lot of really good questions um from

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,359
people that submit things so I guess the

19
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,518
first thing that that comes to mind for

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,800
me it's very fresh in my mind um is

21
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:02,600
hemlock willia delid with which I'm sure

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,478
many of you have been experiencing it

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,478
just finally spread to my yard a few

24
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:11,079
days ago or at least I noticed it a few

25
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,478
days ago um and I I live in a

26
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,158
neighborhood where the neighborhood

27
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,438
association sent out a a strongly worded

28
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,479
email um warning against treating your

29
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:24,158
trees for hemlock adelgid um and one of

30
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,319
my concerned neighbors thought it was a

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,520
little sketchy that they were so

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,239
strongly against it and yeah I did a

33
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:35,118
fact check on it and just didn't stand

34
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:37,438
up on many levels um but I you know I

35
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,159
respect people's right to treat or not

36
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,559
treat uh my neighbor and I share two

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,359
hemlock trees and we we chatted over

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
barbecue last night that we will treat

39
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:50,640
them um and that the the cost benefit

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,879
analysis sort of uh strongly uh weighs

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,599
in favor of of treating them um probably

42
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:00,679
with thematic cloid um or some other uh

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,959
neonic uh has anybody else been seeing

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,399
um hamlock willly delid uh in their

45
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,399
counties

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,200
recently this is Joyce from Duchess

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,800
we've had it for years um because

48
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,199
especially along the Hudson River where

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
it's warmer was where we first saw a lot

50
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,238
of damage on some of the stately old

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,760
hemlocks along um with some of the um

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,959
historical sites it's come out

53
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,679
throughout the county and about every

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
third year there's another article and

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,439
one thing I would like to say is when

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,519
the article came out last year an

57
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,759
elderly couple came in and they were

58
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,879
almost ready to weep that they had this

59
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,318
wonderful hedge and it was going to be

60
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,919
destroyed and what would they do and I

61
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,199
took them outside to the hemlocks that

62
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,039
are here at our Farm and Home Center and

63
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:50,079
we've had hemlock willia delid for 5 10

64
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,039
years it's weakened the tree but I was

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,440
able to show them what to look for and

66
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,000
ask them to go Scout before they hired

67
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,400
someone to spray so if it's new to your

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,800
area I would say that that people

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,879
shouldn't

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,879
overreact and they should understand

71
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:07,199
what it is they're looking for and

72
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,479
understand that it doesn't necessarily

73
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,039
kill the things

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,039
overnight in my thank thanks Joyce I I'm

75
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,280
really Keen to hear what the mortality

76
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,719
is like in certain areas um now the two

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,799
trees that we are going to treat are

78
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,519
pretty weaken to start with um they

79
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,840
might not even be worth saving it's

80
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,959
debatable um but do you see um much

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,319
mortality at all like if you had to get

82
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,360
rough percentage what would you say what

83
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:39,318
would you say um what we what we see is

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,120
they thin over several years and get to

85
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,719
the point where they're starting to look

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,879
ratty enough that people take them down

87
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,400
the ones here at our building because

88
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,878
it's a county building there's they're

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,000
quite thin with maybe a third of the

90
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:57,078
tops gone and the bottoms are still

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,360
green enough that no one has deemed them

92
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,920
to be worthy of damage you know that

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
they're going to fall down or at at the

94
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:06,399
risk of causing damage okay thank you

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,759
and Jason here as a as a hiker and a and

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,280
a person who frequents trout streams I'm

97
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,239
seeing a lot of mortality on these big

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,399
old beautiful Hemlock forests on the

99
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,840
North Slopes in in uh in these kind of

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,758
you know more um untended areas and so

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:26,000
they go they do die

102
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,520
yeah no okay um well thank you for that

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm I'm I'm really quite curious to see

104
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,079
sort of where the h locks are dying and

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,400
as as I think you guys have mentioned uh

106
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:39,079
I suspect it's not 100% mortality um and

107
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,719
you know I guess sort of as we're

108
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,198
experiencing with things like beach bark

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,440
disease we're going to eventually select

110
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:51,360
for more tolerant genotypes uh that will

111
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:53,399
survive uh the outbreak um and it is it

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,479
is sad to see some of these really old

113
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,198
State hemlocks go um and I'm just

114
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,918
curious to see what the potential

115
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,160
introduction of natural enemies will

116
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,439
eventually do to it um for those of you

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,320
are unaware uh there's a small Beetle

118
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,918
called lar cobius um that's been

119
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,159
introduced that loves Hemlock will delid

120
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,038
um and there's also a little camay fly

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,479
that we're looking at introducing the

122
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,318
interesting thing with the canel lied

123
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,800
fly uh it's not been recorded for New

124
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,720
York state but we do have specimens in

125
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,879
the collection from Pennsylvania so it's

126
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,800
pretty close by so uh it's more of a

127
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,120
jurisdictional thing that we have to see

128
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,639
permission to bring it into New York

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,918
State even though it probably does

130
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,360
already occur here it's just our

131
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:40,120
knowledge of smaller flies is pretty

132
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,560
sparse um now I was going to unless

133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,720
there's further questions about Hemlock

134
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,120
Willie deled um there is a comment uh

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,720
about winter cutworms and I was quite

136
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,360
fascinated um by that

137
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,280
because um most of you probably have

138
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,000
realized a fairly recent invasive here

139
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,439
called noctua panuba the common name

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,199
unfortunately is the large yellow

141
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,800
underwing it's not related to any of our

142
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,240
native under wings it is a type of

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,319
cutworm but it's got bright orange hind

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,038
wings with the black border uh the

145
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,039
fourwing is quite variable in pattern it

146
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:15,318
can be from a dull orangish brown to a

147
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,318
modeled uh darker brownish almost black

148
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,120
um that species was introduced into

149
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,639
Halifax Nova Scotia uh that would have

150
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,079
been I think in the 70s and it sort of

151
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,720
sat in Nova Scotia as as a number of

152
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,519
invasives have uh and then for some

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
reason or another just boomed Westward

154
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,598
um and then in the early 1990s it showed

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,960
up in Ontario um I that's where I was

156
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,399
collecting moths when I was younger um

157
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,959
and it just became abundant immediately

158
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,879
and then within a few years I think by

159
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,918
the year 2000 it had made it right to

160
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,918
the Pacific coast um I've heard from

161
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,719
people that were doing uh experiments

162
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,120
here at Cornell that the year that

163
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,080
species showed up it just wiped out uh

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,000
various experiments uh it's just a

165
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,918
standard cut where I'm just like some of

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,399
our other uh pest species um but they're

167
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,198
quite noticeable in that the larvae are

168
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,799
sometimes active midwinter if you get a

169
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,079
a bout of warm weather or bout of

170
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,120
freezing rain or something that they

171
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,878
seem to come out and March around now

172
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,120
they can be separated from similar

173
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,680
cutworms that are native uh by they're

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
usually a little bit bigger um overall

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,439
that's sort of hard to judge though but

176
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,720
the the key character to look at is the

177
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,478
markings along the side of the body

178
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,199
you're going to see series of black

179
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,959
rectangles that go from about um a third

180
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,038
of the way back right to the very end um

181
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,359
and those um black rectangles are quite

182
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,959
prominent they're the only really

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,439
distinct marking and if you've got that

184
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,279
you've got noctua panuba I just want to

185
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,240
verify was that the winter cutworm you

186
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,959
were talking about yeah this was Joyce

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,720
and um because my focus is um is

188
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:58,799
consumer I had a woman call and said my

189
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,919
my beagles are eating these cat these

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,840
caterpillars she called them cutworms

191
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,158
and they're throwing up what are they

192
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,719
and are they poisonous so I'm going in

193
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:08,719
my little Diagnostic lab and looking

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
them up and she sent she actually had

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
she brought in the um the samples and

196
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,439
they were fast little buggers once they

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,759
got warm it was in January and I finally

198
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,478
emerged all happy and I went down to our

199
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,520
agriculture colleagues who said oh yeah

200
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:26,639
that's winter cutworm so they knew it

201
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,918
from a a crop um Pest and I had to

202
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,199
figure out it out by myself but it was

203
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,799
because it was in someone's lawn and the

204
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,800
dogs were um eating it and I did find a

205
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,598
University of Michigan article from

206
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,359
several years ago I think they're just

207
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,479
so active it causes the dogs to throw up

208
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,120
so that's how I learned about the winter

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,200
cutworm interesting I really like that

210
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
common name uh as you probably know with

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,399
insects common names unless it's a major

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,640
pest species are next to useless uh they

213
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,000
vary from place to place and I like that

214
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,519
name because it actually makes sense

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,200
because it is a type of cutworm um and

216
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
their most prominent winter you can find

217
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
them sort of pretty much any month of

218
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,439
the year they're multiv volting here

219
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,839
they have several Generations a year but

220
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,640
the winter they just really stick out

221
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,920
like a sore

222
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,278
thumb um that's really interesting and I

223
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,639
I do wonder if they're chemically

224
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,039
protected they might be um but I suspect

225
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,480
they're probably not um I get a lot of

226
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,439
queries here uh in the Diagnostic lab

227
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,440
from uh a few different organic

228
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,279
producers um so they or especially

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,079
Distributors where they buy organic

230
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,039
produce they distribute it uh it's sold

231
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:35,559
a customer finds a bug in their salad

232
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,559
and they complain um and sometimes

233
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,799
threaten to

234
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,239
Sue and the question that the

235
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,479
distributor wants to know well there's

236
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,240
three questions they want to know first

237
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,159
question is what is it second question

238
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,759
is where is it from and third question

239
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,078
is how dangerous is it and the first

240
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,559
answer uh it varies if they can send me

241
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,599
something or not usually it's a grainy

242
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,879
cell phone pick of a black Speck that

243
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,560
may or may not be an insect

244
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,720
um if they send me a specimen usually

245
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,159
can get some sort of name on it uh the

246
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,680
second question where is it from

247
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,639
unfortunately the answer almost always

248
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,039
is wherever that crop is grown because a

249
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,159
lot of these tests are pretty widespread

250
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,039
uh and the third answer um that I say

251
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,838
sort of semi sarcastically is Choice

252
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,199
edible uh most of these crop pests are

253
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,640
perfectly edible and you're unlikely to

254
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,320
die if you consume it uh there's been a

255
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,039
few where it's like okay yeah that will

256
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,879
make your stomach upset if you eat it

257
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,439
however as soon as your tongue hits it

258
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,838
it's going to realize that tastes really

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,760
bad um and it it's it's sort of amazing

260
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:42,600
to me how some consumers just overreact

261
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,039
to a bug in their salad um and and I

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,320
think it's really unfortunate and we

263
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,159
really need to educate people that you

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,639
know it's it's meat you know it's if

265
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,278
you're as long as you're not vegetarian

266
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,879
or vegan you know um it shouldn't be a

267
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,200
huge issue you just either throw the

268
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:01,240
salad out or and get a refund or you

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,240
know just ignore it kind of thing

270
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,638
um not not uh winter MTH this year or

271
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,799
not winter moth I don't mean that um a

272
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,039
winter cutor but we have we are now

273
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,958
dealing with like this spring uh

274
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,639
emergence of things like Stone flies and

275
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,439
and huge numbers we have a lot of

276
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,879
rivulets and streams and wet areas and I

277
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,920
had a pest Pro come in yesterday with

278
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,120
some Stone flies and he um the customer

279
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,078
wanted him to spray the entire outside

280
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,120
of his house to kill them all and they

281
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,078
were just you know resting on the yellow

282
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,839
sighing so we do get that kind of we

283
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:41,319
don't know what it is there's a lot of

284
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,320
it and shouldn't we just kill

285
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,879
it thigh and yeah sadly as you can

286
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,078
imagine I deal with those as well um two

287
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,838
of the more amable recent ones uh there

288
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,479
was um someone submitted springtails

289
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,240
that were all over her deck uh last year

290
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,519
and she wanted to know how to get rid of

291
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,440
them it's like well you couldn't nuke

292
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,799
your soil but I really don't recommend

293
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,399
it you know it's they they are natural

294
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,000
part of your soil you know get used to

295
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,159
it once it dries out they'll they'll be

296
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,679
gone but the the most dramatic example

297
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,519
was uh a pest control company in New

298
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,198
York City called me up and said okay

299
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,240
listen we're calling you up by By

300
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,559
Request of of our client we don't really

301
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,839
think there's any need to do anything uh

302
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,119
they sent me a photos of it what it was

303
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,639
is the top floor of a skyscraper um

304
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,399
adjacent to Central Park that on the

305
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,079
outsides of the windows that are not

306
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,159
openable there were euman wasps and lots

307
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,399
of them uh and the people that were um

308
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,198
working in the top floor of that

309
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,958
building wanted the building sprayed

310
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,958
because there are wasps on the outside

311
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,319
of the windows um and it just it baffled

312
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,638
me I had a very interesting chat with

313
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,839
the pest control operator and basically

314
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,159
uh encouraged to give them literature on

315
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,320
what these Newman wasps actually do um

316
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,519
and that they're not dangerous at all

317
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
especially since there's no way for the

318
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,720
people to be even in contact with them

319
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,319
it just it seems like the sight of them

320
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,680
was was just enough so I think what I'll

321
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,360
do I'll open it up to uh questions does

322
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:14,759
anybody have any specific questions for

323
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,639
me what this is Joyce talk to us about

324
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,439
folks this experience with earthworms

325
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,799
and or invasive earthworms what's going

326
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,279
on with

327
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,319
that so that's a really interesting

328
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,639
topic and I can't claim to be an expert

329
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,600
on it but it's a a topic that that's uh

330
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,120
near and dear to my heart um in New York

331
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,440
state as I'm sure many of you know there

332
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,519
are no native earthworms um they were

333
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,440
wiped out by the previous glacial period

334
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,720
they would have probably eventually made

335
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,720
it back here um the expansion rate for

336
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,120
Earths is typically about a meter or a

337
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,278
yard a year um depending on the species

338
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,039
um we either on purpose or by accident

339
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,559
have introduced a number of species of

340
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,240
earthworms into New York State um

341
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,239
originally from Europe um um and more

342
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,519
recently several Asian

343
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,879
species um now in the garden in general

344
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,440
and earthor is a great thing you know

345
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,720
they're good decomposed they build soil

346
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,800
fantastic um there's some strong

347
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,639
arguments that earthworms can be quite

348
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,719
detrimental to certain Forest systems um

349
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,399
and where I used to work up in alanin

350
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,879
park in Ontario where again there's no

351
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,679
native earthworms you can actually see

352
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,919
the expansion ring of where Earths have

353
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,879
been dropped in someone's Bait Bucket uh

354
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,399
on some of the Lakes um because there's

355
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,759
very limited settlement history there

356
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,759
there were no Earth rooms and people

357
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,079
have dumped bait buckets and you can see

358
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,959
a ring where the inside of the Ring The

359
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:45,559
Leaf litter lasts less than a season

360
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,479
after that the leaf litter accumulates

361
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,439
for about three years now the effects of

362
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
this is is it does change things so

363
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,959
first of all when you get rid of the

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,720
leaf litter yes you do have that

365
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,159
nutrient pulse but it also causes the

366
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,759
soil to dry out in the later summer

367
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,000
which is a drier time of the year up

368
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,919
there um which can dry out some of the

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,639
the soil organisms as well as some of

370
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,479
the seedlings it does also change over

371
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,399
probably long periods of time the force

372
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,440
composition so with that typical um

373
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,919
three-year Duff layer up there um only

374
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,759
really big seeds get established uh or

375
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,679
really um uh um well nure seeds so

376
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,600
things like sugar maple and Beach are

377
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,519
the dominant trees other things like uh

378
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,240
Eastern hamlock Yellow Birch uh and

379
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,120
Eastern White Pine either depend on

380
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,519
disturbance like small ground fires or

381
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,720
getting established on rocks and logs as

382
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,120
they commonly are up there um so this is

383
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,560
changing the composition to favor um

384
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,480
some of these smaller seeded trees and

385
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,559
also uh further south and Southern

386
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,000
Ontario it's favoring things like ash

387
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,039
which now is being nailed by Emerald

388
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,159
ashbo so it's it's definitely having an

389
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,318
impact there in studies in Michigan

390
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,198
they're showing that certain types of

391
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:02,240
betrium some of the the grape ferns that

392
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:04,679
are quite rare are being negatively

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,680
affected by it they also depend on thick

394
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,758
Duff layers uh of leaves to to protect

395
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,719
them from competition from other sort of

396
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,440
smaller seeded plants um so the effects

397
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
depend on what habitat you're talking

398
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,440
about but definitely they are changing

399
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,800
my suspicion is that they're really

400
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,120
changing the invertebrate composition of

401
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,318
leaf litter in Forest systems um case

402
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,560
and point that uh before earthworms are

403
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,679
here probably the biggest macro

404
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,518
decomposers of dead leaves on the forest

405
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,638
floor were specific types of

406
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,120
caterpillars uh there's whole group of

407
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,000
caterpillars called heriones they're

408
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,679
called Leaf litter moths they're still

409
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,278
around they're still fairly common but

410
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,479
they probably were the major decomposers

411
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:46,240
but they're not as efficient as

412
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,440
earthworms this kept a very complex

413
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,919
intact habitat lots of habitat for

414
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,560
things like uh ground beetles and other

415
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,719
insects that live in the soil so I

416
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,239
suspect there's some huge effects now as

417
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,440
far as Earths getting um dispersed

418
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,839
they're very easy to disperse especially

419
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,199
you know bringing soil in things like

420
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,078
that but uh in studies done in Northern

421
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,720
Alberta they found that you can find

422
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:12,759
earthworms um speckled uh along the

423
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,360
distribution of logging roads and that

424
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,439
earthworm eggs really strongly adhere to

425
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,639
the tread of truck tires and so trucks

426
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,319
are Distributing them just by just by

427
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,319
driving from places with Earths to

428
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,038
places

429
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:30,240
without uh does that sort of um answer

430
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,240
your questions

431
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,639
this is oh Joyce did did you want to

432
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,319
answer thank you because for the others

433
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,759
listening it is interesting when someone

434
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,439
calls up and says on a rainy day and

435
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,679
says my lawn is moving what do I do well

436
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,038
healthier lawn I don't know it's

437
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,440
Earth well go ahead and you brought

438
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,200
something up Jason and as as we are

439
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,200
we're talking to folks about creating

440
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,600
backyard biodiversity and building

441
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,600
habitat things like ground beetles that

442
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:02,079
are great Predators you know they're

443
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,599
losing they're kind of losing their

444
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,519
habitat because of these worms and you

445
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,759
know understanding those beetles a

446
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,400
little bit more and knowing what they

447
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,400
like I think that you know it's part of

448
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,080
our part of our messaging how do you how

449
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,759
do you build good habitat in your

450
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:20,359
backyard and it sounds like they need

451
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:23,440
Brushy kind of cover um and loose debris

452
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:26,359
that they can hide and and hang out

453
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,840
in um and and I think uh there's there's

454
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,599
two points I want to make here um that

455
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,759
that uh discussion is spurred uh one is

456
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,158
um why you see earthworms crawling

457
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,200
around on the surface of the ground on

458
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,320
rainy days uh I used to believe uh as do

459
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,720
I think many other people that it was

460
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,480
because oh well it's raining they'll

461
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,600
drown down there that's actually not

462
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,240
true they actually can survive perfectly

463
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,119
fine as long as the soil is not

464
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,558
constantly saturated they can do just

465
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,719
fine uh in fact I recall going for a

466
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,079
hike back in my undergrad and just

467
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,759
pondering how do earthworms cross

468
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,279
streams and then looking down as I was

469
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,038
crossing a bridge and seeing earthworms

470
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,200
in the bottom of the stream wiggling

471
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,279
along it's like oh okay that's how they

472
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,000
swim um the real reason why they come

473
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:16,119
out on really rainy days is most species

474
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,679
use that as a time to mate and disperse

475
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,158
and so it's much more efficient to

476
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,960
travel across the surface of the ground

477
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,440
than underground and because it's

478
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,960
raining it's moist enough that they're

479
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,679
not going to get too desiccated being uh

480
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,519
above ground so that's the main

481
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,559
dispersal thing uh the second thing was

482
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,359
on ground beetles and um um I'm sure

483
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,558
most of you have seen them if you want

484
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,678
to see how common ground beetles are in

485
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,158
an area go out at night get a headlamp

486
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,840
and just shine at the ground they have

487
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,840
really distinctive ey shine it's two

488
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,480
dots that will look right back at you if

489
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,240
you see six or eight dots those are

490
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,558
typically wolf spiders also quite common

491
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,880
at night if you sample the uh ground

492
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,639
Beetles the cbids of your backyard

493
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,320
unfortunately what you'll find unless

494
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,400
you're out in a pristine wild area is

495
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,558
most of the dominant species are

496
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,880
European in origin uh they've really

497
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,960
taken over uh especially in in uh

498
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,360
Disturbed habitats uh and especially in

499
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,319
agricultural habitats now if you want to

500
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,839
promote ground beetle diversity in your

501
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,200
backyard basically you need a place for

502
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:20,839
them to hide most of the species that

503
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,798
are there um are nocturnal and during

504
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,678
the day they hide under logs and rocks

505
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,119
and what I always advise people when I

506
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,400
especially when I do Master Gardener

507
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:32,719
trainings when I talk about how to um

508
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,440
promote having uh beneficial insects in

509
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,880
your Gardens like ground beetles is have

510
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,519
a place for them to live you know

511
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,240
surround your garden by things like

512
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,319
cobblestones cobblestones are great any

513
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,279
sort of rocks any sort of debris that

514
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:45,798
they can go under during the day is

515
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,440
fantastic and and the cool thing about

516
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:48,720
that is for people that that are really

517
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,159
curious about what's there at night is

518
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,279
you can lift those cobblestones up and

519
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,720
have a look at all the things that hide

520
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,440
there during the day and the majority of

521
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,600
those things will be beneficial insects

522
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,320
uh or at least neutral now some things

523
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,480
like some of the cutworms will use that

524
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,759
but uh on the balance I'd say it's it's

525
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,679
generally beneficial to have places for

526
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,038
things to hide the number one enemy to a

527
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,720
lot of these beneficial insects is just

528
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,278
Lawns um Lawns are just biodiversity

529
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,278
deserts

530
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,720
really any comments or further questions

531
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:23,759
on that on that or something

532
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,200
else this is Joyce I'm sorry to be noisy

533
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,519
I have a photo of the cutworm if I could

534
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,519
share can someone give me the ball

535
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:38,679
interesting um see it yeah now to me

536
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,558
that actually might not be noctua panuba

537
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,440
it's hard to tell so it does have those

538
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,200
rectangles but they're just not quite

539
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,440
right that might be another one called

540
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,679
speed Lotus

541
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,159
clandestina um and the clandestine Dart

542
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,400
um I'm sure it has another common name

543
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,080
as well which is a native species I I'd

544
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,759
have to compare to literature on that

545
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,918
one when when I looked at them um yeah

546
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,759
when I looked at it I threw it out and

547
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,320
then when I called her I said send me

548
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,079
photos so these are the only two photos

549
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:13,879
I have but this is what her dog was

550
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:15,639
eating wow um so yeah I'm not sure um

551
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I'd have to see cutworm identification

552
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,799
can be

553
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,240
challenging um it's probably not to a

554
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,200
perua yeah it's probably knocked to a

555
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,038
perua I we have a lot of folks emailing

556
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,798
us photos now

557
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,879
um we've gotten past the um asking them

558
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,480
to put the ants on the phone so that

559
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,400
they can tell us what who they are so

560
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,159
they're sending us photographs um and

561
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,679
then we oh generally we always try to

562
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,799
get them to follow up with a sample or

563
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,559
stop by um because I think that people

564
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,879
are going more and more to the internet

565
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,319
to just um you know they trolling

566
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,559
they're go they're just finding

567
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,798
everything and then they're getting

568
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,158
really confused and uh you know they got

569
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,319
this thing and then when you look into

570
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,159
it it's you know only from South America

571
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,359
and you know are you you getting a lot

572
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,080
of that too I mean I Jason are you're

573
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:13,278
getting a lot of samples via

574
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:15,199
photo uh absolutely um that's becoming

575
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,278
i' I've been here for four years and I'd

576
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,080
say even in that short time it's it's

577
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:23,319
drastically increased and I encourage

578
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:25,240
people to submit photos because uh quite

579
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,480
often we can at least alleviate some of

580
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,599
their fears um one of the most common

581
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,120
things people you know submit to the

582
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,639
Diagnostic lab is uh they are worried

583
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,199
about bed bugs and so they'll send a

584
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,000
photo of a dermed and right away I can

585
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,798
say okay no that's not a bed bug it's a

586
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,960
dermed you could submit it I can tell

587
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,200
you what kind and where you might want

588
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,240
to look for it kind of thing uh I had an

589
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,480
interesting question yesterday I was

590
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,278
giving a collection tour to a soils

591
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,400
class and one of the students asked me

592
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,679
okay so we have this lovely thing called

593
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,038
the internet and Google why should

594
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
people submit something to the

595
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,720
Diagnostic lab and

596
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,960
uh my answer was quite similar to yours

597
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,400
that well for some things absolutely you

598
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,919
got a big showy butterfly you can

599
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,720
consult the internet and probably get a

600
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:12,038
reasonable answer for it um especially

601
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,919
if you've got a background to entomology

602
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:17,000
you can sort of figure out or know the

603
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,038
reputable websites but you can find

604
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,558
there's as you all know there's so much

605
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,480
garbage out there um so for instance

606
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,119
when someone submit springtails I send

607
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,000
them a little blur back on springtails

608
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:30,678
and what to do uh you know kind of thing

609
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
um but always have to put the caveat by

610
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:37,480
the way springtails do not breed under

611
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,038
your skin and if you Google springtails

612
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,120
unfortunately you will find articles

613
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,519
that say yes they do you'll also find

614
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,439
articles that say they're government

615
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,000
conspiracies and that they're implanting

616
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,720
fibers in your brain and controlling

617
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
things now granted most people will sort

618
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,159
of laugh at the last few but there's a

619
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,720
few that go down that route and I spend

620
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,200
a fair bit of time on the phone um

621
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,839
especially in the winter with people

622
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,080
that have gone uh you know down the

623
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,480
rabbit hole and it can be really

624
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,759
challenging to convince them that well a

625
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,079
I'm not part of the conspiracy um and B

626
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,720
that some of these websites are you know

627
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,439
blowing hot air that there's there's

628
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,399
really nothing to it um say that I think

629
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,080
it is really valuable and and for some

630
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,798
people that submit stuff I'm just

631
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,519
surprised that they didn't Google it

632
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,038
like some of them are just so obvious um

633
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,759
like if you have

634
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,960
uh let's say a pest on your hibiscus uh

635
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,119
it's it's pretty easy to Google pest

636
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,038
hibiscus and there's a good chance

637
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:43,439
you'll get a reasonable answer um not

638
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,839
always but but usually um and some just

639
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,120
you know submit really distinctive

640
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:50,678
things and the ones that I find don't

641
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,319
use the Googles and talk to me first uh

642
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,480
tend to be sort of on the older end of

643
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:59,038
things and just not so internet Savvy um

644
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,120
and some of the the the ones that um are

645
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,240
are really susceptible to paranoia tend

646
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,678
to not even have email um so I have to

647
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,558
uh talk to them either in person or or

648
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,120
on the

649
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,440
phone I'll have one more with what seems

650
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,479
to be an early spring we here in the

651
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,960
Hudson Valley have all sorts of things

652
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,919
blooming and the Red Wings black birds

653
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,919
are back what do you think we will

654
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,399
see will we see more activity earlier

655
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,600
activity um what can we anticipate in

656
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:32,599
terms of calls and and um oh my goodness

657
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,759
what is this in terms of of early

658
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,240
spring oh very difficult question um so

659
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,480
as you know it's really hard to Crystal

660
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,798
Ball these sort of things um with an

661
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,038
earlier season what I would guess is

662
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:49,918
that certain migratory species that

663
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:52,879
become pests uh things like uh cornerer

664
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:57,240
worm army worm they might be able to get

665
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,960
here earlier and uh establish sooner um

666
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,558
now the big years that we have for those

667
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,440
typically correspond with really warm

668
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,519
Winters further south um and ideal

669
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,480
conditions for them that aren't too wet

670
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,480
uh and I think that's the case so we may

671
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,038
see more uh larger numbers of that

672
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,640
another one that sort of falls into this

673
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,119
pattern is Diamond Back moth where

674
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,360
they're also generally migratory there

675
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,879
are some exceptional individuals that

676
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,558
can over winter um further north like

677
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,679
even in New York state there are records

678
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,798
of that um but it's certainly not nor

679
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,360
this year might be different we only had

680
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,480
at least here in Tomkins County we only

681
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,319
had a few quite cold days but that might

682
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,440
not have been cold enough to kill off

683
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,879
things like diamond back moth so it just

684
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,120
sort of advances the season they might

685
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,760
be able to squeeze in another generation

686
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:51,639
uh and become more of a problem that way

687
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,558
um otherwise it really depends on how

688
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,200
much moisture because the other thing

689
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,759
that was quite striking about this

690
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,399
winter uh at least here um in Tomkins

691
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:05,240
county is the very little snow that we

692
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:07,239
got um and the cold snaps seem to really

693
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,200
hit the ground quite hard so you

694
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,720
probably noticed a lot of needle ice

695
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,880
this year if you have bare patches of

696
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,038
ground where you get these sharp uh icy

697
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,039
needles that pop up with soil capping

698
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:21,319
them that's basically uh a condition you

699
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,119
get when you've got no snow cover cold

700
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,720
snap and basically water through

701
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,278
capillar action comes up for the soil

702
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,558
and forms these needles that's really

703
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,000
quite damaging to a lot of insects that

704
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:34,359
just overwinter in the leaf layer uh in

705
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,880
years where you have a lot of snow cover

706
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:39,359
um and the winter is not exceptionally

707
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
cold you actually have insects and

708
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,079
especially spiders active all winter

709
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,278
long underneath the snow um and that

710
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,079
certainly probably wasn't the case at

711
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:49,519
least during the cold days um this

712
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:54,558
winter since there was essentially no

713
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,880
snow up here um so my long-winded answer

714
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,440
or the short version of my long-winded

715
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,919
answer is it's hard to say but I expect

716
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,640
a few more pests will get an early head

717
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:06,440
start this year what is the forecast for

718
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,000
blacklegged

719
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,919
tick ah um blacklegged ticks um also

720
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,480
known as deer

721
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:20,559
ticks um I don't know um I I found very

722
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,919
few this winter like uh in previous

723
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,000
Winters uh if I'd go out I'd get a few

724
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,519
on me e on warm days in the winter even

725
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,720
if it was just slightly below freezing

726
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,399
you'd still get the odd tick uh I've

727
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,600
seen none this year I know that's just

728
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:36,439
an anecdote I don't have any real data

729
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,759
to support that so I don't know um I

730
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,399
think the only way we'll find out is

731
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,759
just by experiencing it um I'm more

732
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,278
familiar with some of the other tick

733
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:49,319
species up north and the big things that

734
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,960
seem to knock them back um were uh the

735
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,359
fall conditions and I'm trying to

736
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,079
remember back to what our fall was like

737
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,398
um the fall conditions being

738
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:59,439
exceptionally cold and damp were not

739
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:01,479
friendly to to the ticks if they were

740
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,399
warm Dry Falls they seem to do really

741
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,120
well that winter I suspect it's probably

742
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:07,678
similar for blacklegged tick so I my

743
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:12,359
short answer is I don't know are there

744
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:15,200
any um any kind of hot pests that you

745
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:18,000
hope you don't get any samples of that

746
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,840
we should be on the lookout for uh hot

747
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
pest so we don't get samples out that we

748
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:26,119
should be of that we uh should be

749
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,359
looking out for um there's quite a few

750
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,798
um bark beetles um that I've been

751
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,240
showing up um it's I went to a bark

752
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,200
Beetle workshop two years ago in Florida

753
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,278
and it was disturbing how many new

754
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,440
species show up every year especially in

755
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:44,440
the Southeast but also up here um and

756
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,120
they can go undetected for many years um

757
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,080
so there's a number of bark beetles that

758
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,879
I would worry about but but quite

759
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,480
frankly at this point we have so many

760
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,880
non-native bark beetles here it's it's

761
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,200
um except for for specific ones I

762
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,760
wouldn't worry too

763
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,159
much um

764
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,278
down towards Long Island um Southern

765
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,240
pine beetle has seemed to spread North

766
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:08,240
and is nailing a lot of the Pines there

767
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,359
I don't know how far north that one will

768
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,120
get um that's really hard to predict

769
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,519
that and at least with the w Western

770
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,479
counterpart the mountain pine beetle

771
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,759
it's really highly dependent on a lot of

772
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,440
old

773
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,599
trees um and warm Winters and again this

774
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,320
is probably a fairly warm winter so it

775
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,759
it might have spread a bit further north

776
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:33,398
I don't know how far far nor it will get

777
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:37,720
though um as far as other things go um I

778
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:41,158
really don't know um there is a new

779
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,159
longhorn beetle that's has shown up um

780
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:48,200
near New York City uh in Westchester

781
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,120
County um and the unfortunate thing is

782
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,720
it's so indistinctive that the way to

783
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,518
key it out is it lacks all the

784
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,480
distinctive spe features of all the

785
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,880
other

786
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,159
species um and it's

787
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
it's been well established in that yard

788
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:04,200
um and I think it's probably going to

789
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,399
spread Now is it going to be a pest on

790
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,038
trees maybe uh it seems mostly be

791
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,599
emerging from firewood um but there is

792
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,440
some evidence at least in Utah where

793
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,918
it's established uh that it can affect

794
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,200
uh fruit trees

795
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,440
negatively um beyond that um your guess

796
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,000
is as good as mine I really don't know

797
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,320
and I just need to be we all need to be

798
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,839
prepared for anything that's sort of new

799
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,798
and when I'm asked the question okay how

800
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,599
do you prepare for the next invasive and

801
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,839
the thing I advise people is be familiar

802
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,240
with what's in your backyard and if

803
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,519
something looks different be suspicious

804
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,200
because these new invasives that become

805
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,399
a problem they tend to show up and show

806
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,720
up very drastically and suddenly and so

807
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:48,638
they'll stick out to to a lot of people

808
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,919
should we expect any negative impacts to

809
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:54,719
some of our garden beneficials due to

810
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,399
the lack of snow cover a good question

811
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,240
um I'd say probably yes and probably no

812
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:02,119
it all depends on the species uh the

813
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,679
thing with a really healthy garden um

814
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:07,319
the beneficial insects should be diverse

815
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,360
um both in diversity of species and

816
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:12,079
diversity of families and Orders of

817
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,759
insects uh if you depend on one species

818
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,599
let's say one type of ground beetle um

819
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,158
chances are some event will knock them

820
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,959
all back uh with this this weird winter

821
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,600
where we had almost no snow cover and

822
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,079
when it got cold there was no snow cover

823
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,199
it seemed um yeah some of the things

824
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,599
will be negatively affected the thing

825
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,639
with uh a lot of our native species

826
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,638
though is they are adapted to this for

827
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:37,759
the most part and yeah some will get

828
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:39,719
knocked back some won't um and insect

829
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,720
populations will fluctuate so that's my

830
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,558
wishy-washy answer of maybe maybe not

831
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:50,038
depending somewhat kind

832
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:53,918
of can you highlight some of the your um

833
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:56,359
preferred sites uh for Gathering some

834
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,519
information on their own so I'll point

835
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,359
out a few things so as l mentioned the

836
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,278
insect Diagnostic lab if you Google

837
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,519
insect Diagnostic lab Cornell you'll

838
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:08,639
find us uh we do have fact sheets um for

839
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,079
a lot of different insects um so you can

840
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,800
click on that and there is is

841
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,159
information a lot of different groups um

842
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,280
also there's information uh if people

843
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,119
want to submit samples to us or you've

844
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,000
got a client that wants to submit to us

845
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,519
um if it's a really difficult sample

846
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,960
here's the information for it how to

847
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:29,119
send it uh it's really key uh key to

848
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,760
emphasize that I need the information on

849
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,240
where it's from when it's from kind of

850
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,079
thing uh and also to package it

851
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,118
appropriately it's disturbing how many

852
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,119
people it will put an insect uh wrap it

853
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,240
up in a Kleenex put it in an envelope

854
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,159
and send it through the mail and expect

855
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,439
me to piece together a thousand pieces

856
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,760
of insect and try to identify it um so

857
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,559
always make sure they put it into some

858
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,520
sort of crush proof container so um

859
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,440
that's sort of the Shameless

860
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:58,358
self-promotion aspect of it um other

861
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
than that um bug guide um so bug

862
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:03,719
guide.net if you've never used this

863
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,839
website use it it's fantastic um my bias

864
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,358
is I am one of the editors on this

865
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,880
website but basically what you can do so

866
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,960
if you you're completely clueless you

867
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,000
have no idea what you can do go to ID

868
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,480
request um you have to set up an account

869
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,400
is free um and you uh basically add an

870
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,320
image you submit an image and depending

871
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,358
on what it is it can be identified in a

872
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,400
few minutes or sometimes a few years it

873
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,480
all depends um but usually someone will

874
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,480
move it to an appropriate place

875
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,800
how I use it a lot um is if you go to

876
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:38,519
the guide uh you can pick your your

877
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:41,960
insect group uh um let's say insects uh

878
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,639
be let's pick Beetles for now um you can

879
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:48,800
go to taxon pick the family that you

880
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,838
want um let's say you've got some sort

881
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,519
of scare Beetle and you want help

882
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:54,719
identifying it you can go to images I'll

883
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,838
just show you General images but if you

884
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,078
go to browse it shows you the different

885
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:00,440
subfamilies so you can can quickly

886
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,800
browse it let's say okay I think I've

887
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,599
got an aod IR uh dung beetle okay it

888
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,680
narrows it down further you can click on

889
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,559
that and go right down to species and

890
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:14,759
for each species you know there'll be an

891
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,119
in uh an image uh the info for it and

892
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,000
some of them will have elaborate

893
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,480
information on on it um and sort of

894
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,800
habitat stuff some will have a lot more

895
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,559
information some will have links and

896
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,440
this is where it gets really useful you

897
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,920
can see the links where you can get more

898
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,280
information for proper identification so

899
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,760
if you went to fods you'll see that link

900
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,119
is is the really good one to identify

901
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,720
things to gener and then the species it

902
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:47,240
depends um also for each species so you

903
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,959
can also Google let's say um you've got

904
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:53,838
something on

905
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,838
fraxinus caterpillar this sometimes can

906
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,480
work and so it gives you some of these

907
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,800
images let's say you go to this one okay

908
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,519
yeah it kind of looks like that look at

909
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
the range so where they've got specimens

910
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,599
from ah it's an Eastern thing it's in

911
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,839
New York okay that's reasonable here's

912
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,480
the the time you see it um sort of thing

913
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:15,039
so this is um I think one of the most

914
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,920
useful resources um for it um not just

915
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,039
uh that but also will link to other

916
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,838
useful resources so for this particular

917
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,960
species here's a link to moth

918
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,159
photographers Group which has

919
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,480
information another website so several

920
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,679
websites that have um further

921
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,039
information

922
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,118
um so basically beyond that start with

923
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,159
bug guide and it will if it doesn't have

924
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,000
the answer it'll link you to the answer

925
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,078
and of course you can always uh submit

926
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,199
to the insect Diagnostic lab um as a

927
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,000
general rule for um people related to

928
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,879
the

929
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,000
CCE uh if uh you don't want to pay the

930
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:56,119
$25 if you just want a yes or no answer

931
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I will do that for free um but for a

932
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,039
what is this answer um I'll I do charge

933
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,358
for that um as long as if you're

934
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,358
expecting yes or no answer if if maybe

935
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:08,880
is an acceptable answer then then yeah I

936
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,039
can I can usually do those for free and

937

that and you can find my contact info

940
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,358

941
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:21,880
just Google me I'm always Keen to hear

942
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,719
what um uh various Educators get in uh

943
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,599
other counties because for a lot of the

944
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,199
things that are easier to identify I

945
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,359
just I never hear about it um they just

946
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,679
don't come across to to me very often so

947
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,318
uh thank you so

948
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:38,199
much this has been a production of
