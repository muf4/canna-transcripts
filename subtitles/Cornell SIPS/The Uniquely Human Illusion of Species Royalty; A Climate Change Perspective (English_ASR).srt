1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
university

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,678
yeah thanks uh thanks evan and

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,160
thanks to the department of natural

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,079
resources for giving me this uh

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,879
opportunity to go beyond my usual

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,719
repertoire of climate change slides uh

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,480
so i had to come up with a lot of new

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,919
stuff uh and this seminar is gonna

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,719
really reflect a lot of ideas that have

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
been

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,640
bouncing around my head for some time

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
and i'm curious to see

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
your reaction the first thing probably

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,398
is a little bit of uh

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,959
explanation about the title i'll try to

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
do that in terms of us being unique i

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,200
mean i do think you know just that so

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,878
many people would show up to a seminar

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,559
to hear about their own species being

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,280
dethroned

22
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,238
that's kind of unique about humans only

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,239
humans would do that

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,000
but you know that's not my objective

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,439
i'm really hoping that you know

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,119
when you leave here you'll you'll really

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,399
begin to recognize that there's a lot to

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,560
be gained

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,478
in appreciating what modern science is

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,799
revealing about our similarities with

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,679
other species that the differences are

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,920
really a matter of perspective

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
are existential angst about being alone

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
well we are not really so alone

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
we are not exempt from natural laws as

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,478
i'll emphasize quite a bit we are not

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,478
supernatural and i think many of us

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,759
academics i will argue when it comes to

39
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,000
our intelligence

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
actually have that tendency

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,599
and recognizing our limits might

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
actually help us tackle our biggest

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,919
environmental challenges

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,240
um so as was alluded to i mean i'm

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,118
coming up soon on my 25th anniversary of

46
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,319
doing climate change research

47
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,599
and you know in those years there's

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,039
really been two kind of broad surprises

49
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,399
that i've had

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
one is

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,200
the magnitude and pace of climate change

52
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,118
has been much more than i expected i

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
really in fact started by doing direct

54
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,159
effects of carbon dioxide on plants

55
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,239
thinking that the

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,600
climate change while it would come much

57
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,759
of it would come

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,359
after my career i didn't expect the arc

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
to be melting

60
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,479
when i still had

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,239
several years to go

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,360
the second surprise has been the

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,520
persistence of denial out there now i'm

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,160
not talking about

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
some valid debates about we have climate

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,919
change and should we or shouldn't we do

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,318
something about it but this this actual

68
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,318
persistence of denial that it even

69
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,598
exists

70
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,000
and now there's actually of course quite

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,839
a body of research there's a lot of body

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,439
research on climate change per se and

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
now there's a growing body of research

74
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,318
on why is there this denial

75
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,480
i'm only going to cover one little

76
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,000
thread and that's really going to focus

77
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,598
i think fairly relevant to this

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,919
department

79
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,119
on evolutionary biology the evolution of

80
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,359
the of the human mind um and how the

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,039
that the the con this constrains our

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
ability to tackle some of our global

83
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,158
environmental problems

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
okay the word illusion um i had thought

85
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,959
about the word delusion but that's got

86
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,518
kind of a psychotic twist and i decided

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
to be kind to our species and uh call it

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,400
illusion that means we don't

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,158
really have a take on reality

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
um

91
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,199
and

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,199
uh uh two two components of that

93
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,238
illusion i'll be emphasizing one is that

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,158
we are

95
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,959
exempt from natural laws which is kind

96
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,120
of a pre-enlightenment era problem but

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,640
i'll argue academics are as guilty as

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,280
anybody of still having a a major

99
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,639
fragment of that exemptionalism going on

100
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,878
and it has to do with our intelligence

101
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,119
um this idea that there's there's no

102
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,518
bound uh of our intelligence in terms of

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,799
the context of the evolution of our mind

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,039
that we can think our way out of

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,360
anything

106
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,199
an analogy that i often

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
think about myself when i

108
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,000
wrestle with this issue is thinking

109
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,679
about

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,639
let's look at birds and there they have

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,840
a special trait obviously ability to fly

112
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,438
imagine

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,120
eagles for example thinking well i'm at

114
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,400
the top of the i'm the best of all the

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
flyers

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
and taking that information instead of

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
sort of recognizing but still there are

118
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,639
limits because i have a certain wing

119
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
span etc thinking that you could fly

120
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,199
anywhere up to the heavens to see the

121
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,599
gods throughout the universe

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
that's actually i think what many humans

123
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
maybe many academics do with their

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,160
intelligence

125
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,799
the second illusion

126
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,800
related to the intelligence is that this

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
leads to a level of self-awareness and

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,079
there's of course a whole continuum of

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
self-awareness out there among species

130
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,399
and we're

131
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,918
just as we can

132
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,918
you know uh

133
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,478
surpass most other species on an iq test

134
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,039
in terms of levels of self-awareness

135
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,399
we are quite up there

136
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,319
but it could be at a point where it's

137
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,638
actually leading to an illusion taking

138
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,478
us away from reality

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
nicholas humphrey who's a theoretical

140
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,719
psychologist calls self-awareness a

141
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,879
magical mystery tour we staged for

142
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,600
ourselves

143
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,279
is this adaptive

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,199
or is that an illusion that does not

145
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,679
reflect ecological reality and that

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,600
constrains our capacity to adapt

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
so that's my explanation of the the

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
title

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,959
and i'm going to crank through my slides

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
i have a lot of stuff to go through

151
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,239
a lot on kind of these issues uh that i

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,720
mentioned sort of the evolution of the

153
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
human mind evolutionary theory etc to

154
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,280
begin with and uh

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,439
kind of last i'll get into its relevance

156
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,638
to climate change so first this is kind

157
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,000
of just an outline of what we'll be

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,918
talking about i'm going to talk about

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
our place on the tree of life

160
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,319
going from our great chain of being

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,560
hierarchy perspectives to modern

162
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,240
evolutionary theory

163
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,639
i'm going to go through a scientific

164
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
critique of the human exemptionalist

165
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
paradigm for those of you who aren't

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
familiar with that i have some papers

167
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
you could i could send your way after

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,038
this

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
but this is um

170
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,879
leads us to a couple of issues

171
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
um you know are complexity and

172
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,360
intelligence really unique and quote

173
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,758
royal traits or are they traits like any

174
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,840
other for example flight olfactory

175
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
ability

176
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,478
i'm going to talk about the mystical

177
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,919
mind how self-awareness in our our quote

178
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,918
free will

179
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,000
leads us to a notion of being unbounded

180
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,439
and exempt from natural laws we have a

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,360
little person between our ears really

182
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,000
a lot of us feel this way and i think

183
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,439
it's hard to divorce ourselves from that

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
and then finally our complexity

185
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,959
intelligence self-awareness for the

186
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
adaptive traits as i mentioned then i'm

187
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,239
going to talk about the evolutionary and

188
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,478
genetic constraints to human

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,478
consciousness

190
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,318
and then finally some realistic taking

191
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,918
this information and developing more

192
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,280
realistic approaches to addressing

193
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,839
climate change and other environmental

194
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,839
challenges

195
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,840
okay

196
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,839
here's aristotle's ladder of life

197
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,279
it has a uh what was really viewed at

198
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,519
the time of course there was there was

199
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,159
you know is a static

200
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,399
collection of species that range in

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,880
complexity of course microbial life was

202
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,038
not even uh known about this time

203
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,240
man of course is at the top

204
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:13,360
uh and notice that intelligence is is up

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
there at the top um as well not as

206
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,919
simply some trait that we have but it's

207
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,560
something that really takes us into the

208
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,879
spiritual realm

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
and i think that this is a place where

210
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,519
while today with modern ecology we

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,199
recognize that humans

212
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,279
interact with all these species and are

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,800
part of natural systems but i think we

214
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,399
often

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
get led into this notion that our

216
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:41,519
intelligence is something quite unique

217
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,359
and takes us to uh to the spiritual

218
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,519
this uh

219
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
aristotelian a notion got perfected

220
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,120
during the middle ages into this

221
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,918
so-called great chain of being

222
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,439
many many of the greatest thinkers of uh

223
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,399
for hundreds of years worked on the

224
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,279
great chain of being whose fits where

225
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,279
um

226
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,959
and there was a lot of uh uh

227
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,799
philosophers of the day

228
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,478
arguing for example that where we knew

229
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
man was at the top and there had to be a

230
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,120
god so therefore there must be angels

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,160
there's a lot of philosophical articles

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,199
about that

233
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,639
um saint thomas aquinas uh was uh took

234
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,759
part in uh some of this was in that era

235
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,439
and um

236
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,840
interesting to me having been raised a

237
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,439
catholic where i kind of uh you know

238
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,598
what the nuns told us is only humans

239
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,120
have a soul well saint thomas aquinas

240
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,360
didn't feel that way he felt actually

241
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,320
all living things had a soul but humans

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,519
had three souls and other species had

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,200
one or two so there's vegetative souls

244
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
sensitive soils which would be what we

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,519
call today sentient beings that might

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,399
have some level of intelligence but not

247
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,440
able with our special rational thought

248
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,958
and

249
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
this is kind of relates somewhat to an

250
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,879
area of philosophy today that's called

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,440
personal and non-personal minds a

252
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,360
personal mind is a mind that has not

253
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
only intelligence but a strong sense of

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,159
self-awareness whereas a non-personal

255
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,480
mind can be an intelligent being but has

256
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,559
a very weak or no sense of

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
self-awareness

258
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,278
this hierarchy got perfected look at

259
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
this list um we got royalty at the top

260
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,919
this is the you know work by very very

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
serious scholars in the middle ages who

262
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,679
fits where i like where you know actors

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
today are like such big shots right like

264
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,639
they're like royalty

265
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,639
they're just below beggars

266
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,159
of course now we can wonder you know

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
where would the

268
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,240
graduate students undergraduates

269
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
professors be but i'll leave it up to

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
you

271
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,278
this all got completely turned on its

272
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
head uh with darwin of course and of

273
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,639
course with a group like this we can can

274
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
we ever say enough about darwin

275
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,439
everything i ever work on he's already

276
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
done it

277
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
um

278
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
but he really did uh you know

279
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
revolutionize our thinking and in fact i

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
would argue uh what he came up with has

281
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
not really sunk in even among many

282
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,200
ecologists um today

283
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,120
uh really the main thing a

284
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,640
non-creationist tree of life not a

285
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,879
hierarchy

286
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,639
that all the species that we see today

287
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,958
have gone through the filter of natural

288
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,559
selection in sort of an equal fashion

289
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,399
they've been carrying on their genes for

290
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,838
at least some time

291
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
and some of them have been carrying on

292
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
those genes for billions of years

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,600
whereas other species have been carrying

294
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
on those genes like ourselves for maybe

295
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,720
a hundred thousand two hundred three

296
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,039
hundred thousand years something like

297
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,040
that but that we've all uh gone through

298
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,439
that that same filter

299
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,719
there was a continuity uh evolutionary

300
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
continuity

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,680
that

302
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,679
the difference in intelligence between

303
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,359
uh creatures was not a difference in

304
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,359
kind but a difference in degree

305
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,159
our own whitaker the whitaker room over

306
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,679
in uh course in mud many of you are

307
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,639
probably familiar with

308
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,078
he was one of the

309
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,679
leading

310
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,199
ecologists who worked on the five

311
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,479
kingdom evolutionary tree of life

312
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,160
perfecting what we know about evolution

313
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,759
primarily from the fossil record

314
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,039
microscopy

315
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,200
dividing

316
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,759
single celled organisms into prokaryotes

317
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,480
without a nucleus and eukaryotes

318
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,879
protozoa here

319
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,879
with the nucleus and nutritional studies

320
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,519
notice how this is dominated by

321
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,838
multicellular life

322
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
and humans still get up there somewhere

323
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
near the top probably the top of the

324
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,799
animals right

325
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,599
and gives you a perspective of there is

326
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,838
microbial life is now encompassed

327
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,480
well then along in the 1980s came a

328
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,560
fellow named carl woes who really

329
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,920
kicked us once again on this whole

330
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,359
evolutionary tree of life thing and

331
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,759
brought us into the molecular age and

332
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,000
molecular genetics age and turned much

333
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,319
of this on its head by

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,879
evaluating the molecular genetics of

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,040
even just the bacterial branch he found

336
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,200
if the if the yardstick of what is a

337
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,159
kingdom is the difference between a

338
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,160
human

339
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,439
and a mushroom

340
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,759
if that's the yardstick we're going to

341
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,000
use then within the bacterial branch

342
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,000
alone there had to be at least a dozen

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,559
different kingdoms

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,519
and he in fact discovered an entire new

345
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,078
uh domain of life the archaea

346
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
he was battled by many evolutionary

347
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,799
biologists who were primarily fossil

348
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,320
hunters and this didn't sit too well

349
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,000
because

350
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,440
his

351
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,919
his results really show that document

352
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,440
very clearly how much of life on our

353
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,439
planet has been microbial

354
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,600
but he made a major stamp almost as

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
dramatic as darwin's i would argue

356
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
here's the new evolutionary tree it

357
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,278
shows up in campbell's biology book

358
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,559
today it's making it into all the

359
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,240
textbooks

360
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,599
this is really

361
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,759
um

362
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,159
talking about perspective

363
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,078
um here's three kingdoms of the old five

364
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,120
kingdom tree the fungi animals and

365
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,159
plants right there

366
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
and this gives you definitely a

367
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,319
different perspective of a few things

368
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
first of all this new tree is really

369
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,600
based on the distances between these

370
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:08,480
things really reflect evolutionary time

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,159
i'm all of this life is microbial

372
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
much of the five kingdom tree and much

373
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,600
of our talk about evolution in the past

374
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
is based on the it's an eye of the

375
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,680
beholder

376
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,679
view of the world and how things work

377
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,359
multicellular life

378
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,479
also when you think about this i'm going

379
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
to be talking in a moment about

380
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,600
intelligence as an adaptable trait

381
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,838
you can see based on evolutionary time

382
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,399
how how it's been really within the

383
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
flick of an eye how long we've been here

384
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,159
and how long intelligence as a trait has

385
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,599
been around

386
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,078
and so it really has not been well

387
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,079
tested

388
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,879
but we still think but yeah yeah yeah

389
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,198
but we're you know but we win the iq

390
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,278
test we're more complex than everything

391
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,120
and etc

392
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,720
but uh you know

393
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,039
evolutionary biologists have been you

394
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,480
know trying to bring home to people for

395
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,039
many years this is some something out of

396
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,959
stephen j gold's book some years ago

397
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,879
talking about that complexity does not

398
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,638
equal progress as evolution goes

399
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,720
evolution can actually move in either

400
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,198
direction but it's clearly bound by the

401
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,199
left wall of minimal complexity the

402
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,078
upper panel is looking at pre-cambrian

403
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,278
time

404
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,198
and

405
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,639
the bottom panel is looking at today's

406
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,159
distribution of species in sort of a

407
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,079
cartoon fashion

408
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,399
as the number and kinds of species have

409
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,879
increased over time the right tail has

410
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,159
obviously developed some things spill

411
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,919
out into that tail but things can also

412
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,679
go the other way but they can't go

413
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,039
against that left wall

414
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,479
so the numbers and frequency of the

415
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,240
simplest forms have increased but we've

416
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
also developed a tail

417
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,399
the small number of species forming the

418
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,559
tail do not indicate an evolutionary

419
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,600
sequence of progress just the inevitable

420
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,958
consequence of the laws of probability

421
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,360
if we with all of our brilliance

422
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,078
set forth the nuclear holocaust and we

423
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,839
wiped out that tail

424
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,439
it would grow back

425
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
it would not be any of the same species

426
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
we know today intelligence might never

427
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,799
show up again

428
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,879
that could be just a happenstance of

429
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,879
what the conditions were during

430
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,278
that early period but that's something

431
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,639
to kind of keep in mind about

432
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,439
complexity

433
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,759
and

434
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,519
that sort of thing

435
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,360
but aren't humans truly unique in

436
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,560
complexity intelligence yes we win the

437
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,000
iq test and we're very complex

438
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,039
but

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,799
protozoa here much of our genetics much

440
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,360
of our genetic complexity in our own

441
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,399
bodies in all living things is really

442
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,879
wrapped up

443
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
you know we share with the protozoa much

444
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,399
of

445
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
earth life's complexity was worked out

446
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,078
in those first two or three billion

447
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,078
years it has to do with cellular biology

448
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,519
some of you may know about darwin's last

449
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,000
book a 300-page treatise on earthworms

450
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,399
and their importance to cycling uh

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,799
recycling and geology

452
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,559
in there he devoted 50 pages of 300

453
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,879
pages of his last book to earthworm

454
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,359
intelligence

455
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,720
um now i was looking for a human that

456
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,959
you know would be complex i was looking

457
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,278
for mona lisa or something and i don't

458
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
know i came up with penelope cruz

459
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:19,600
uh

460
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,800
i mean i've always thought i've never

461
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
met her but i

462
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,439
i would think of her as being a very

463
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,919
complicated woman she looks very

464
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,639
complicated

465
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,919
but but look at giuseppe

466
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,480
i mean what's going on in that mind

467
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,240
um you know i'm joking around but you

468
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,278
know what i want to point out is that

469
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,639
complexity again is a matter of degree

470
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,799
um intelligence oh yes the smartest man

471
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
that ever lives some would say certainly

472
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,599
one of the most brilliant people of the

473
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,799
20th century

474
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,079
einstein but when einstein was about

475
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,078
you know until he was about two and a

476
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,838
half years old he probably would flunk

477
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,000
well he would he would not do as well in

478
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
an iq test as that monkey or most

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
primates

480
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
in fact until he was age five or seven

481
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,798
he probably didn't not have the same

482
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,959
level of self-awareness as an adult

483
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,679
chimpanzee

484
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
so it's kind of age dependent

485
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,400
but

486
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,078
but certainly we do i'm not arguing that

487
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,519
we we don't have

488
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,759
you know some amazing abilities with

489
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,199
abstract thought

490
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,759
so now i want to go through and talk

491
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,519
about complexity and intelligence and

492
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,199
each of these topics i've got on this

493
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,359
list are worth the seminar on themselves

494
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,440
i'm just going to run through

495
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,558
some things that actually have come to

496
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,080
light really in my career

497
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,480
one of the first is

498
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,599
the human genome project now when i was

499
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,120
younger

500
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,798
the thought was the estimates for the

501
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,319
human genome were 50 000 to 140 000

502
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,679
genes we had to be the most of course

503
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,839
with most complicated creatures we had

504
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,000
to have the most genes it turns out we

505
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,038
had thirty thousand

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,640
um which is you know uh good news it's

507
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,480
about thirty percent more than a

508
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
nematode

509
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
but

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,279
it's about thirty percent less than a

511
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,839
tomato

512
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,440
uh so that kind of blows that theory of

513
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,879
course i know the geneticists out there

514
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,558
going what about spliced genes what

515
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,480
about we've gone beyond one gene one

516
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,240
protein there's we've come up with our

517
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
explanations for why you know this

518
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,679
doesn't hold anymore this isn't a good

519
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,119
the only indicator of complexity but

520
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,400
just to point out a few things that have

521
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,319
changed

522
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
our genetic makeup we have found is not

523
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,839
that unique we knew we were closely

524
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,400
related to the chimpanzees and other

525
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,639
primates but we didn't know that 99 of

526
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,759
our genes are similar to chimpanzees

527
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,520
and then of course immediately the

528
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,359
thought was when we found this out oh

529
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,119
yeah so that's all that all has to do

530
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,439
with brain power i one percent more

531
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,798
genes going into our amazing brain power

532
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,519
it turns out that many of those genes

533
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,759
have to do with larynx development

534
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,160
and in fact our frontal lobes while the

535
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,240
average brain size of humans is is

536
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
larger than most primates the frontal

537
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,480
lobe which is

538
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
in the uh brain scientists here that's

539
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,599
where rational thought comes from is

540
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,519
about the same as many primates

541
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,599
the neurochemicals associated with

542
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,519
emotional feelings and behavior are also

543
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,918
observed in many species we previously

544
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,879
assumed functioned instinctively

545
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,679
so oxytocin which is comes we can detect

546
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,559
in humans during mother daughter mother

547
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,200
child bonding shows up in other species

548
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,678
serotonin dopamine all kinds of

549
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
emotional

550
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
neural chemicals show up in other

551
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,079
species so if they're instinctive then

552
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,480
we're instinctive too or or else they

553
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,399
are much more like us than we thought

554
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
many social animals have sophisticated

555
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,640
language skills and i imagine this group

556
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,880
would follow some of the news about that

557
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,799
everything from prairie dogs to dolphins

558
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
to of course primates and they were

559
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,960
learning more about body language and

560
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,399
that sort of thing

561
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
abstract thought does not require

562
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,440
language for some research on pre-verbal

563
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
infants as well as some animals

564
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
several

565
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
other species have surprising levels of

566
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,919
self-awareness the one that kind of

567
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,919
really got to me is a fairly recent

568
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,720
report about dolphins

569
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,799
who in their first year of life named

570
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
themselves come up with a name for

571
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,759
themselves

572
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,839
and not only that but but uh others of

573
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,359
their species who might leave them for

574
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,720
some years and come back can remember

575
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,639
their names which is beyond what many

576
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,440
humans can do

577
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,520
uh

578
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
and the other thing is uh there have

579
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,279
been conversations as we're cracking the

580
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,879
code of dolphin dialogue

581
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,678
there's been conversations between

582
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,919
dolphins where they are naming another

583
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,640
you know the name of another of their

584
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
species is being brought up

585
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,919
many other species use tools in

586
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
sophisticated ways and this goes way

587
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,840
beyond primates particularly bird

588
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
species

589
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,119
and size doesn't matter when it comes to

590
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,240
brains

591
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,759
particularly bird brains

592
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,079
pigeons is a recent study showing

593
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,480
pigeons have numerical

594
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,038
capacity up to the scale of many

595
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,038
primates

596
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,000
so

597
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,319
and this is actually the modern genetic

598
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,400
sort of way of the correct sort of way

599
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,439
phylogenetically to

600
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,679
describe our our place um within our

601
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,240
closest relatives and you see we aren't

602
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,679
really above the rest

603
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,519
um

604
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,038
and why don't we really celebrate this

605
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,558
kinship um i'm not sure um

606
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,558
i think that's one thing i would like to

607
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,440
sort of bring out in this discussion

608
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,960
today is is talk about that how really

609
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
um instead of thinking of ourselves

610
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,319
about being above everybody else

611
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
recognizing the kinship and yet of

612
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,599
course

613
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,839
recognizing our unique capacity

614
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,639
is important darwin had some thoughts on

615
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,639
this

616
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,559
he saw this coming

617
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,520
and animals who have we have made our

618
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:42,480
slaves we do not like to treat as equals

619
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,480
it's not convenient

620
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,038
okay continuing with our notion of

621
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:50,000
superiority science versus the mystical

622
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,759
mind the spiritual mind the unbounded

623
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
intelligence

624
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,759
so i've given while we have superior

625
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,559
intelligence it's not a royal trait

626
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,319
except in our own minds

627
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,319
like other traits

628
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,558
dogs have a have the ability for to pick

629
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,439
up certain sense ten thousand times on

630
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,038
what humans can do

631
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,519
there is a continuum of ability among

632
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,000
species with intelligence and excelling

633
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,400
at one single trait does not guarantee

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,240
evolutionary success

635
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
our intelligence is also constrained by

636
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,919
the context of its evolution

637
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
and i'm going to have some slides to

638
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,159
follow which are going to bring this

639
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,038
into gear in particular to climate

640
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,880
change how the context of what the world

641
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,038
was like the climate was like as our

642
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,080
minds evolved affects our ability to

643
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,079
deal with climate change

644
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,440
the trade as i mentioned when i was

645
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,200
showing the new tree of life is a very

646
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,200
recent introduction

647
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,400
and whether the adapter or the long haul

648
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
has not been established

649
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,000
in fact it may be maladaptive

650
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,159
as it may lead to an illusion of

651
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,599
separateness from other species that we

652
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,559
know is not true based on what we know

653
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,399
about ecology an illusion of unbounded

654
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,359
and unbiased

655
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,360
mental capacity

656
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,599
that uh that self-awareness issue can

657
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,000
really become

658
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,199
a bit of a trap for ourselves

659
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,759
and

660
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,120
lead us into a place where we we can't

661
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,919
really can't

662
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,918
get out of it

663
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,840
is it the ultimate achievement of

664
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,000
intellect our self-awareness or source

665
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,480
of delusion what did the smartest man in

666
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,880
the world have to say about that

667
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,798
we experience ourselves our thoughts and

668
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,960
feelings as something separate from the

669
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,200
rest a kind of optical delusion of

670
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,880
consciousness the delusion is a kind of

671
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,278
prison for us restricting us to our

672
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,640
personal desires into affection for a

673
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,640
few persons nearest to us

674
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,120
okay

675
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,120
now i'm going to turn my attention to

676
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,278
getting into a little more details about

677
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,798
the context of our evolution and how

678
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,720
this might affect our response to

679
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,480
climate change

680
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,400
the human mind evolved primarily to

681
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
respond to local conditions it was it's

682
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
a natural selection it came from a brain

683
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,278
an organ it didn't come from the spirits

684
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,519
above it's not different than

685
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,558
the ability of birds and their wings to

686
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,400
fly

687
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,119
it's it's constrained by what our how

688
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,120
our brain evolved and that brain evolved

689
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,759
in response to natural selection which

690
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,278
was not dealing with abstract global

691
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,079
challenges on the other side of the

692
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:28,000
planet local challenges and so here i

693
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,119
think climate change among environmental

694
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,880
problems

695
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,359
is uniquely

696
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,200
difficult to deal with compared to for

697
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,599
example fracking or local water

698
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,600
pollution problem

699
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,879
which are can be very local

700
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,839
on the other hand

701
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,640
the

702
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,119
many people are afraid of the

703
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,038
the reaction to climate change that is a

704
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,278
policy for example that might affect

705
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,200
their local economy

706
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,278
in other words a gas tax which is going

707
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,440
to make their life their local

708
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,359
environment more difficult

709
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,759
so there's this kind of two-pronged

710
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,879
issue where people many people are more

711
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,960
afraid of the local consequences of a

712
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,200
policy reaction to climate change than

713
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,519
they are to some abstract global

714
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,519
threat

715
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
like all products of evolution

716
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,080
human consciousness is actually

717
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,840
pragmatic in nature

718
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,119
while capable of abstract thought our

719
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,720
minds are more interested in the

720
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,719
concrete

721
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,038
i suppose at a place like cornell you do

722
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,400
tend to find more people that are

723
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,759
you know quite fascinated with the

724
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
abstract uh

725
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,480
i'm i'm there

726
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,400
um

727
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
but but really if you look at the human

728
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
species at large uh we're much more

729
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,240
interested in what works not why it

730
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,038
works and and that really is the

731
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,798
consequence again of evolving the mind

732
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,798
evolving through natural selection

733
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,359
you know one thing our intellect has

734
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,519
done is create complex social structures

735
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,359
in part many

736
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,119
uh there's one school of thought that in

737
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,519
part our complex social structures

738
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:02,399
whether it be governments or religions

739
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,798
are a response to the anxiety of this

740
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,440
sense of agency and choice that we have

741
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,720
this sense of self-determination

742
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
so that

743
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,079
instead of having to make all these

744
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
choices ourselves we let the group that

745
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,158
we belong to make some of those choices

746
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,319
for us

747
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,840
it could be everything from going to war

748
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,960
to not doing anything about climate

749
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:26,399
change or could be on the positive side

750
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,558
um so our social structures can work for

751
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,120
us or against us but they can actually

752
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,000
in many cases limit our

753
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,519
capacity for choice many uh recent

754
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,038
climate change studies have shown some

755
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,918
surveys have shown

756
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,158
that

757
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,840
even shown solid evidence of climate

758
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,679
change right in their neighborhood

759
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,199
depending on the social group people are

760
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,360
with they may or may not believe in

761
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,120
climate change

762
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,959
our minds evolved over a long period

763
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,918
when there were very few humans on the

764
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,079
planet and abundant resources over a

765
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,159
hundred thousand more years homo sapiens

766
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,519
have been around and during almost all

767
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,880
of that time into the last couple

768
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,440
hundred years

769
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,480
the pressure on our resources

770
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,480
was not like it is today so it was quite

771
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,798
our minds involved in a time when we

772
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,798
could go out and get what we needed from

773
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,720
the resources around us of course

774
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,119
there's some local issues some local

775
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,120
times when uh for example jared diamond

776
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,439
in his book collapse talks about

777
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,158
things can still locally become

778
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,080
restrictive but in general

779
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,799
we we have that sort of issue to get

780
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,439
around we now are in on a planet where

781
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,879
um we have many more people

782
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,120
in our minds involved in a period of

783
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,399
climate stability compared to current

784
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,398
and projected climate change

785
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,798
so now i've got a few slides to kind of

786
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,600
go through emphasize a few of those

787
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,359
things the thing about human population

788
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,879
and i know it's not very clear from the

789
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,639
back but you don't need to see the

790
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,480
details really this graph in the upper

791
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,360
right this is showing

792
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,200
going back to 10 000 bc

793
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,719
showing the number of humans on the

794
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,720
planet

795
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
and actually of course you know homo

796
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,720
sapiens has been around another at least

797
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,520
another 80 90 000 years depending on

798
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,519
the data you look at but you know almost

799
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,440
no humans no humans during all that

800
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,599
evolution of our minds

801
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,759
it's only been in the very recent past

802
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,000
that we've had this skyrocketing in

803
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,240
population

804
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,079
so from this you can see why in our

805
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,399
brains have not really evolved to keep

806
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,240
up with that sort of population growth

807
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,239
this is just another way of illustrating

808
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,120
this

809
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,278
at the time of uh jesus christ there

810
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,879
were 250 million people that's estimated

811
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,519
on the planet

812
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,720
took 1500 years to double that to 500

813
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,480
million it took homo sapiens about 120

814
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
000 years

815
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
to produce one billion people on the

816
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,759
planet

817
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,119
now it's taking us just a little around

818
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,119
a decade to add a billion

819
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,839
climate change this is going back um

820
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,278
400 000 years

821
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,199
so keeping it somewhere within the

822
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,000
confines of

823
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,720
our genus and its evolution

824
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,159
here's the temperature trace

825
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,679
co2

826
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,000
as we all know greenhouse gases

827
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,600
correlate with temperature

828
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,759
these ice ages are caused by actually uh

829
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,319
astronomical features earth orbital

830
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,359
changes earth tilt of the axis changes

831
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,079
that are pretty well understood at least

832
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,479
they're triggered by that

833
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,359
homo sapiens came back let's say around

834
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,880
here

835
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,879
oh it looks like some well that's pretty

836
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,720
rapid change let's look at this one

837
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,440
coming out of the last ice age into the

838
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,440
holocene the stable relatively stable

839
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,519
period rather that looks like a very

840
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,759
rapid change but keep in mind

841
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,480
you know this is ten thousand years it

842
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,879
took about twenty thousand years to rise

843
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,798
about eight degrees centigrade nine

844
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,080
degrees centigrade which is about point

845
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,398
0.1 degrees centigrade per 100 years

846
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,759
0.1 degrees centigrade for 100 years

847
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,918
keep that figure in your head when i

848
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,200
talk about what's projected for this

849
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,559
century

850
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,798
in my next slide i'm just going to show

851
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,359
a very recent period just going back

852
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,839
about you know 12 000 years

853
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,879
um the younger driest period from here

854
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,759
to here

855
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,760
and the holocene

856
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,200
so

857
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,640
about 11 000 years ago or so end of the

858
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,640
last glacial

859
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,440
we had a rise with the younger dryas of

860
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,399
about four and a half degrees centigrade

861
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,759
8.1 degrees over the course of a couple

862
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,519
thousand years

863
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,839
that too is less than something like

864
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,839
half a degree c per hundred years

865
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,360
the medieval warm period was a very

866
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:45,519
dramatic period in the medieval times

867
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,240
people began colonizing greenland and

868
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,158
farming there then came along the famous

869
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,919
little ice age so-called little ice age

870
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,000
it wasn't a real ice age

871
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,880
but that was a temperature drop of about

872
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,880
one degree c

873
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,480
again i'm showing you these numbers to

874
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,558
put in context of the climate change

875
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,278
that's projected for our century what

876
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,519
did that little ice age drop do

877
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,440
what were the impacts of that

878
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,679
communities were completely abandoned in

879
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,840
greenland iceland and northern europe

880
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,200
average male height declined across

881
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,199
northern europe

882
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,600
the pope ordered witch hunts

883
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,038
to figure out who was causing this

884
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:25,038
little ice age

885
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,038
that's what a one degree c drop can do

886
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,839
um here's that co2 and that graph i

887
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,799
showed you going back 400 000 years at

888
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,959
the top i had the co2 trace going back

889
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,440
and forth 400 000 years back and forth

890
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,720
between about 200 and 280 this is just

891
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,480
focusing on the co2 trace and this is

892
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,480
what's happened in very recent times

893
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,918
currently we're we've risen about 0.8

894
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,079
degrees c 1.4 degrees just enough since

895
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,399
the industrial revolution and of course

896
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:57,439
the spooky part is the the trajectory

897
00:31:54,398 --> 00:32:00,000
we're on now in terms of co2

898
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,000
that's the business as usual scenario

899
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
here's if we really get our act together

900
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,919
and start slowing this down but look at

901
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,679
the magnitude of these even sort of a

902
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,679
best case scenario

903
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,600
uh compared to some of the magnitudes i

904
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,480
talked so do we think our minds have

905
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,439
really can really wrap around this i

906
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,440
think there's some challenges there

907
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,919
in case you're like you know feeling

908
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,919
sort of uh special thinking about how we

909
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,759
can impact the climate change now again

910
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,720
you know we're superior because only we

911
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,240
could do that to the climate

912
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,120
i suppose many of you in this room would

913
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
know who did that before us the

914
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,359
cyanobacteria the first photosynthetic

915
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,399
organisms

916
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,719
took our

917
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,479
about 2 billion years ago

918
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,480
invented photosynthesis which took up

919
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,919
co2 gives off oxygen

920
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,159
wiped out mass extinctions of anaerobic

921
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,000
uh species that lived on the planet when

922
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,720
multi-cellular plant life came on it

923
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,798
rose the oxygen level even further with

924
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,839
more photosynthesis so

925
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,879
we're not alone in being able to do that

926
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:04,240
um okay we're on our grand uh climate

927
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,240
change experiment

928
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,960
phase one is complete

929
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,440
completed in my career

930
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,440
i didn't expect it

931
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,200
despite clear floral warning and maybe

932
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,519
this is

933
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,120
you know my bias i thought we were clear

934
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,880
but maybe not

935
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,798
we did not have the mental capacity to

936
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,799
avoid a magnitude of climate change that

937
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:28,240
will negatively affect at least some

938
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,240
humans and other species

939
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,919
phase two is in progress

940
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,759
will we have the capacity to cope with

941
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,840
that is simply adapt

942
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,359
to some of the inevitable climate change

943
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,119
underway

944
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,918
how good is our intelligence our

945
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,439
capacity to work together etc phase

946
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,919
three is also in progress will we have

947
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,278
the capacity to prevent

948
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,880
mitigate

949
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:55,119
a truly catastrophic change in climate

950
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,640
what's a catastrophic change in climate

951
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,239
well

952
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,600
i mean some people think it's you know

953
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,200
it's all just going to be warmer and

954
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,798
better and it's not catastrophic at all

955
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,319
of course

956
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:05,519
others say it's a matter of degree and

957
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,239
there's certain things that could be

958
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,519
okay and nice and some that might not

959
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,678
let me just show you something from a

960
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,960
recent science that kind of spooks me a

961
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,240
bit

962
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,039
this is from a recent article by

963
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,118
different bond chris field in science

964
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,440
coming out actually in the most recent

965
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,200
intergovernmental panel climate change

966
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,599
studies

967
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,918
this puts into perspective what happens

968
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,200
uh if we burn up all the fossil fuels

969
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,960
that's what this graphic is really about

970
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,559
on here something

971
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,159
that should be familiar to you except

972
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,480
it's on again on even smaller scale this

973
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,960
is that co2 trace going back 800 000

974
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,960
years here up and back between 200 and

975
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,280
280 parts per million

976
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,000
thousands of years before the present

977
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,560
800 000 years here's the various

978
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
scenarios fossil fuel use scenarios that

979
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,000
we've talked about playing out this

980
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,320
century

981
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
possibly up to 800 parts per million or

982
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,800
so

983
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,880
and i gave you some numbers about what

984
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,920
that could mean five degrees six seven

985
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,838
degrees c rise in temperature

986
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,760
here's where we go if we burn up all the

987
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,679
fossil fuels

988
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,000
which has been estimated at 20 000 giga

989
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,000
tons

990
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,920
2 000 parts a million

991
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,240
i told at the beginning i've done a lot

992
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,680
of co2 research on plants and one thing

993
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,439
you know one sort of little silver

994
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,358
lining to some of the climate change

995
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
work has been that when plants are

996
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,679
exposed to higher co2 levels because

997
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,319
they take co2 for photosynthesis to grow

998
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:33,118
it can benefit some plant species but we

999
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,200
never went up to 2000 not very often and

1000
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,039
in fact when you do the leaves curl they

1001
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:40,078
get starch grains and the plants don't

1002
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,440
do very well at all so that co2 level

1003
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,119
even if there weren't a concomitant

1004
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,800
climate change would

1005
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,240
wreak havoc on a lot of plant life on

1006
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
the planet

1007
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,239
uh it's a imagine that this would uh

1008
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,079
speculate this will diminish over time

1009
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,439
due to photosynthetic uptake and some

1010
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,519
other things

1011
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,960
but that level

1012
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,880
you've all probably read the information

1013
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,240
about what even this level might mean

1014
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,480
for sea level rise etc uh that could be

1015
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,639
uh close to catastrophic not that there

1016
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,079
won't be any humans left on the planet

1017
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,358
but they're all going to be in the

1018
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,359
highlands of ithaca new york

1019
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,838
um

1020
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,280
i just got this cartoon there for a

1021
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,799
little break

1022
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,720
um

1023
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,560
bringing back uh i'd like to bring in

1024
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,838
these you know powerful

1025
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,400
big time thinkers here to support my

1026
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:28,320
arguments

1027
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,800
darwin it's not the strongest of the

1028
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,320
species that survive nor the most

1029
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
intelligent

1030
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,280
that survives it is the one that is most

1031
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,400
adaptable to change

1032
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,680
he didn't put a lot of faith in

1033
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,599
intelligence

1034
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,679
can we successfully think our way

1035
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,320
through our self-imposed environmental

1036
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,480
challenges that's the question

1037
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,240
i posed to you now i'll come up with a

1038
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
couple

1039
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,000
pieces of evidence looking

1040
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,679
for

1041
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,440
a way to leave you with some optimism

1042
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,759
and now there are some i've you know

1043
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,760
i've been

1044
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,159
heavy on the negative

1045
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,320
we have turned a corner on human

1046
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,239
population growth rate i did not think

1047
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,720
this would happen when i was young and

1048
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,719
run airlift's population bomb

1049
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,719
we have actually made some significant

1050
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,358
changes

1051
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,598
this is a recent science article

1052
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,358
showing dramatic reductions in the

1053
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,200
global fertility rate there's some

1054
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,960
exceptions continental africa many

1055
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,960
nations there still have fairly high

1056
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,199
fertility rates this wasn't really

1057
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,639
intentional it wasn't really um

1058
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,399
you know in all cases something where

1059
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,679
we've got we're reaching a maximum of

1060
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,920
our resources sometimes it was

1061
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,480
simply a focus on poverty or social

1062
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
justice

1063
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,719
gender issues

1064
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,479
education of women as well as men

1065
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,039
etc but

1066
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,199
i think a real example of something to

1067
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,599
be optimistic about i think in case of

1068
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,919
china's official one-child policy it

1069
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
wasn't yes that's that's exactly true i

1070
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,159
would say it was that that's an

1071
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,760
intentional example right

1072
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,519
which has its own you know i mean might

1073
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,520
have issues about that but it was

1074
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,280
intentional um

1075
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,880
ecological models now more clearly

1076
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,320
recognize human societies as part of

1077
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,480
natural systems ecologists are doing

1078
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,880
this routinely uh this is something from

1079
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,280
terry chapel and mathematics a climate

1080
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,039
change model and very strong emphasis on

1081
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,320
social systems in there i think that's a

1082
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,000
very positive uh sign

1083
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,160
we have begun to acknowledge and even

1084
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,480
celebrate our kinship with other species

1085
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,838
just a few months ago

1086
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,639
india declared

1087
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,400
dolphins non-human persons with

1088
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,000
special rights

1089
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,440
uh so several other countries have done

1090
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,559
the same thing

1091
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,639
it means you can't have them in

1092
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:47,039
captivity you can't have them doing

1093
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:48,960
tricks for you uh a variety of things

1094
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,639
going on there

1095
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,559
i think we're learning about a lot about

1096
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,559
framing the discourse on climate change

1097
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,920
i like this quote

1098
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
know when we when we talk uh

1099
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,079
particularly the people who

1100
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,679
we're trying to bring into the issue not

1101
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,680
people who are very familiar and ready

1102
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,159
to go at it and start

1103
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,598
fixing things

1104
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,399
my opinion is

1105
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,160
that

1106
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,760
the best we can do especially as we're a

1107
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,519
lot of nature lovers here in the natural

1108
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,760
resources department

1109
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,039
most of us are in a department like this

1110
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,320
or affiliated with a department like

1111
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,039
this because of our passion for the

1112
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,599
natural world actually being i would say

1113
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,838
almost in love with the natural world

1114
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,599
i think sharing that

1115
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,960
is probably the most productive thing we

1116
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,640
can do in terms of at least getting

1117
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,240
people on the right course rather than

1118
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,000
talking to them about how polluted the

1119
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,759
world is and how they they've got

1120
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,679
something they've got to do to fix it

1121
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,800
that can come later

1122
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:52,239
but people don't want to destroy

1123
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,160
that which they love and i think part of

1124
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,159
what is so wonderful about the world is

1125
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,920
actually our connection with other

1126
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,078
species our similarities and not our

1127
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,320
differences

1128
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,480
on a more kind of concrete level

1129
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,240
communications

1130
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,599
researchers have done a lot on framing

1131
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,598
the issues and they kind of come up with

1132
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,318
some approaches

1133
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,119
that i think were

1134
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:17,119
discovered because they work

1135
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
but actually from what i've talked about

1136
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,920
in this seminar i think you can see

1137
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,680
there's some

1138
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
it relates to some of these evolutionary

1139
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,598
constraints

1140
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,318
communication now by emphasizing the

1141
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,000
human and the local impacts not the

1142
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,079
global impacts

1143
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,159
and emphasizing practical solutions and

1144
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,640
economically viable alternatives to the

1145
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,639
path we're on

1146
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,239
and to the extent we respond to local

1147
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,679
while the local impacts are changing

1148
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,679
mindsets here and there

1149
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,598
when people have to pay the costs of

1150
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,000
adapting

1151
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,079
dealing with climate change even among

1152
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,679
the farmers that i work closely with

1153
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,760
the most recent and intensive and

1154
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,078
comprehensive survey

1155
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,400
in the midwest of um

1156
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,839
something like six thousand

1157
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,920
farmers

1158
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,039
uh maybe it was forty i'm sorry 4 800

1159
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,119
farmers

1160
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:13,279
uh found that over 65 percent uh said

1161
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,318
they quote believed in climate change

1162
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,839
not all of them were convinced seeing

1163
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:20,920
what were causing it

1164
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,920
but majority felt that was human caused

1165
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,800
there's a lot we can

1166
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,119
see around us individuals local

1167
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,119
communities governments corporations

1168
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,318
attempt to make a difference for some of

1169
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,599
my friends in the room i've got

1170
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,599
solarized caroline there

1171
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,400
walmart gets

1172
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,519
a lot of um

1173
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,519
you know

1174
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,559
bad press and it's got some issues now

1175
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,400
with pay rates for employees i know

1176
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,559
and whether this is just green washing

1177
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,920
or how deep it goes but just the just

1178
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,039
the fact that they feel like they need

1179
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,280
to do this

1180
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,440
is i think a sign in the right direction

1181
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,800
and of course the unipcc again i might

1182
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,318
be biased because i've been affiliated

1183
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,000
in various ways

1184
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,519
um

1185
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,239
you know i think that that's an example

1186
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:07,039
of our social structures actually doing

1187
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,039
a decent job

1188
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,719
so isn't intelligence an adaptive trait

1189
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,639
it will be up to us to demonstrate that

1190
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,318
as so particularly the younger people in

1191
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,719
the room

1192
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:21,440
until then it's really not a fact

1193
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,919
it's a it's a belief it's a faith and

1194
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,920
it's a hope

1195
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,759
and i'll leave you with this quote that

1196
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,358
i like

1197
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,319
if you look at the science about what is

1198
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,598
happening on earth and aren't

1199
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,800
pessimistic you don't understand data

1200
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,559
but if you meet the people who are

1201
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,839
working to restore this earth and the

1202
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,679
lives of the poor and you aren't

1203
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:41,679
optimistic you haven't got a pulse

1204
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
i have some references here for those

1205
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,039
who are interested but i think i'll just

1206
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,680
leave it with that slide and

1207
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,679
okay questions thanks

1208
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:10,679
this has been a production of cornell

1209
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,679
university on the web at cornell.edu

1210
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,318
you
