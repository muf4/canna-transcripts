1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,750
University great thanks for the

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,730
introduction you need I guess I need to

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,500
apologize I realized on the way down the

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,289
elevator I switch the title around on

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,089
the poster says angstroms two acres if I

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,559
swish it makers hang sure we just do to

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,940
the presentation of the flow I'm gonna

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,189
start with my field soils and they move

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,410
more than my molecular level studies so

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,969
yeah in essence this is going to be an

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,528
overview of my dissertation work that's

13
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:26,969
broadly focused on the interaction of

14
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,778
soil organic matter with mineral

15
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:32,519
surfaces so a quick outline of what I'm

16
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,469
going to go over here I'm gonna come

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,510
right back round kind of explain why I'm

18
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,890
asking the questions that I'm asking now

19
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm gonna show some results from some

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,730
field soils that I collected from

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,429
Pennsylvania I'm gonna wrap up with a

22
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:47,788
series of laboratory scale experiments

23
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:49,079
looking at model systems and hopefully

24
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,140
have some time for acknowledgments and

25
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,299
some really nice questions all right so

26
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,890
some quick background so soil organic

27
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,869
carbon and nitrogen represent really

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,128
important pools of carbon nitrogen on

29
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,229
the planet for reasons that have already

30
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,420
been covered extensively the semester in

31
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,609
the seminar series and one of the main

32
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,200
reasons is because soil organic matter

33
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,170
which contains carbon and nitrogen is

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,750
stabilized in soils and there are a few

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,549
really big known stabilization

36
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,509
mechanisms of soil organic matter in

37
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,549
soils one of which is physical occlusion

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,989
of soil organic matter so we take our

39
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,189
organic matter here and we surround it

40
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,170
with something like a mineral particles

41
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,618
or something like that so it's not

42
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,879
accessible from microbial breakdown

43
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:33,780
hence it is stabilized and remains in

44
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:35,188
the soil there's also this concept of

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,900
chemical recalcitrance where we have

46
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,779
these big kind of bulky hulking

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,150
molecules that are unwieldy to attack

48
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,210
enzymatically and they aren't

49
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,469
mineralized and ansar stabilized then

50
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,239
there's this last point that i'm going

51
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,519
to be talking primarily about and that

52
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,219
is this association of organic matter

53
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,349
with soil minerals and as Angela kind of

54
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,849
talked about a month or q ago this can

55
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,919
take on a few different forms one of

56
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,989
which is the co precipitation of organic

57
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,579
matter with soil minerals and the other

58
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,438
form is what I'm gonna be talking about

59
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,478
today primarily is the adsorption

60
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,159
of organic matter from solution onto

61
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,340
mineral surfaces there were soil

62
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,509
particles in various forms

63
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,340
so it dissolved organic matter if we

64
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,299
talking organic matter in solution we're

65
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,340
going to be talking about that is all

66
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,170
organic matter fraction and if you pick

67
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,819
up a soil science textbook and go back

68
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:23,739
to the glossary and look up his all's

69
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,879
organic matter or deal them you're going

70
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,790
to get a definition that's fairly

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,500
similar to this a mixture of soluble

72
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,780
organic materials derived from the

73
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,990
release end or partial decomposition of

74
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,340
plant and microbial residues I

75
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,840
underlined mixture there because I think

76
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,120
it's an exceptionally important point

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,590
here so dissolved organic matter readily

78
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,539
absorbs on mineral surfaces but it's a

79
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,240
mixture so not all components have a

80
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:48,549
tendency to adsorb equally there are

81
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,110
some factors that we know associated

82
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,790
with dissolve organic matter composition

83
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,370
have a pretty big impact on the

84
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:56,349
adsorption one of which is molecular

85
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,990
size are we looking at the absorption of

86
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:01,060
my favorite molecule here Gallic acid on

87
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,800
a mineral surface or are we looking at

88
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,170
it's more kind of polymerized complex

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,180
counterpart I don't know the name of

90
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:09,549
this but generally speaking this is

91
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,719
larger and dissolve organic matter

92
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,110
molecules that are larger have a

93
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,580
tendency to preferentially adsorb the

94
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,960
functionality so the functional group

95
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,290
composition of the organic matter is

96
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,000
also considered to be really important

97
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,319
and more specifically organics matter

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,509
that's enriched in functional groups

99
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,939
like aromatic phenolic and carboxylic

100
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,649
type groups are believed to play a

101
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:34,030
really important role in retention of

102
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,409
dissolved organic matter and last but

103
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,270
certainly not least is the elemental

104
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:40,629
composition of the organic matter itself

105
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,370
for the do am generally speaking do em

106
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,780
with carbon to nitrogen ratios on the

107
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,759
low side that is higher in nitrogen

108
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,379
relative to carbon is believed to

109
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,479
associate very strongly directly with

110
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,009
mineral surfaces so that could take the

111
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,669
form or something like this nice model

112
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:56,379
peptide here on the left but also

113
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,909
biomolecular constituents like this PT

114
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:02,740
toxin here on the right also would be

115
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:04,270
retained pretty strongly but as you

116
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,240
I tell from the title and and so many

117
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,950
other presentations this semester on

118
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,480
organic matter interactions with soils

119
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,269
this is a cross scale thing it's not

120
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,429
simply a molecular level issue so in

121
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,780
soils we have a lot of surface inputs of

122
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,650
dissolved organic matter either through

123
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:23,459
release or released actually by roots or

124
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,629
or through senescent plant material and

125
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,099
what happens is as this dissolved

126
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,959
organic matter enters the soil solution

127
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,550
it percolates downward through the soil

128
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,879
matrix where it's subsequently subjected

129
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,340
to a series of inputs and losted as it

130
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,500
moves through the profile and some of

131
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:40,060
the main inputs are released by biota we

132
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,439
can also see these origin and release of

133
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,069
dissolved organic matter back into the

134
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,029
solution and some of the the main losses

135
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,819
that we're aware of that we know that

136
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:50,439
occur in soils are this adsorption by

137
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,180
the soil matrix you can get uptake by

138
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,889
soil biota and we can also get the

139
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,110
precipitation of the organic matter with

140
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,000
minerals generally speaking as we move

141
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,439
down a profile the losses kind of went

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
out and we tend to see less dissolved

143
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,120
organic matter as we go down a profile

144
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
but I kind of had a question with this

145
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,430
so if we have DM inputs at the surface

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,350
and all these downstream processes going

147
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,509
on what happens if we take the surface

148
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,700
soil where you know the bulk of organic

149
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,649
matter is and we kind of invert it or we

150
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,139
disturb it as one might see and let's

151
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:21,399
say tillage and agricultural system what

152
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,110
does that do to all these downstream

153
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,929
processes that dissolve organic matter

154
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,730
in a soil profile and with that question

155
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,670
in mind I'm going to start showing some

156
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,560
results from some field studies that I

157
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,870
did looking at dissolved organic matter

158
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,860
dynamics in a cultural soil from

159
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,899
Pennsylvania so the specific field site

160
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,370
that I used is the penn state russell

161
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,269
larson egg Research Center in Rock

162
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,790
Springs Pennsylvania

163
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:47,620
I got working with these plots back when

164
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,080
I was still a baby a Penn State student

165
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,069
I wish I had a picture of me then you

166
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,219
guys wouldn't even be able to tell the

167
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:55,689
difference

168
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,160
and this field sites are located

169
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,019
basically smack dab in the middle of the

170
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,700
state of Pennsylvania right in the

171
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,589
absolutely gorgeous ridge and valley

172
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,379
province of PA and the nice big

173
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:06,849
limestone valley the plots that i used

174
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:09,399
are part of this tillage experiment that

175
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,010
was initiated back in 1978 so happy 40th

176
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,289
birthday tillage experiment plots these

177
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,819
are pretty long-term and they're I think

178
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,150
there were three or four different types

179
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,478
of

180
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:21,370
tillich treatments in these 24 plots by

181
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:23,289
focused only on two plots and and two

182
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,209
tillage treatments and those were the

183
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,220
no-till treatment and the the moldboard

184
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,109
tillage inist and these plots were

185
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,760
subjected to a moldboard disking to

186
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,030
about 20 centimetres every year in the

187
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,430
spring and something else I'd like to

188
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:39,429
point out is the sampling that I did

189
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,259
within these plots I sampled at a couple

190
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,139
different locations so there's this

191
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:48,509
access road here I cuts adjacent to the

192
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:52,689
plots I sampled that 125 feet 375 and

193
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:57,009
625 feet from that access road and the

194
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:59,469
sampling itself it looked like this so

195
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,500
we pulled three cores out of the ground

196
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,840
at each one of those sites and pulled

197
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,089
them forever and this is what the cores

198
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,329
looked like from the till plot and the

199
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:11,638
no-till plot we can see that the soil

200
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,689
we're working with here is kind of uh

201
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,889
well these aren't the best pictures but

202
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,379
this is what is called the Hagerstown

203
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,939
soil series and this is a fairly typical

204
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,529
alpha saw this was developed over

205
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,918
limestone residual I'm down in central

206
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,929
PA

207
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,469
it wasn't glaciated so these are fairly

208
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,490
old soils and if the lighting were a

209
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,440
little bit better and these cores

210
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,478
weren't ride you could really see at the

211
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,969
tilled soil what it's made up of is

212
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,069
basically a nice well-defined ap horizon

213
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,200
down the 20 centimeters followed by a

214
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:40,899
series of BT horizons as we move down

215
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,370
the profile and the no-till soil also

216
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:50,209
has an a horizon but it's more of a

217
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:51,949
gradual decrease into the BT horizons so

218
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,388
those cores I pull them again into three

219
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:57,500
and then I split them up into five

220
00:07:53,389 --> 00:08:00,199
different depth increments and from

221
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,220
there I was interested in isolating and

222
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,660
characterizing the dissolved organic

223
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,090
matter so that was kind of the focus

224
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,370
this study was the d-line fraction so I

225
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,529
did a fairly standard um extraction

226
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,259
procedure I suspended the soil and water

227
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,568
out of one to ten L water ratio shook it

228
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,180
overnight pass it through a point two

229
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,220
micron filter and the subjected the

230
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,189
filtrate to a series of characterization

231
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:25,370
methods one of which is this total

232
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:27,709
organic carbon and nitrogen within the

233
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,149
do M fraction I did some optical

234
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,389
characterization with you Eva's

235
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,708
spectrophotometry so I looked at the

236
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,708
extent of aromatic functionalities

237
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:38,899
within your organic matter and then last

238
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:41,208
but certainly not least here I made some

239
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,519
fluorescence excitation emission

240
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,049
matrices of the organic matter samples

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,458
and I'll get more into what that means

242
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:51,379
as I get closer to working with them so

243
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,969
let's get a feel for the the bulk soils

244
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,639
themselves what kind of properties do

245
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,610
these have a soils are mildly acidic

246
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,720
they have a pH around six none of the

247
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,070
the samples deviated too far from that

248
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,920
kind of nice knowing that pH wouldn't be

249
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,440
a confounding factor here texturally the

250
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,469
soils kind of had a real silt rich

251
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,829
topsoil and became gradually finer as we

252
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:19,129
went down into the subsoil and the

253
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:20,569
mineralogy of these soils is kind of

254
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,399
interesting we have some alumina

255
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,740
silicate clays alight and kaolinite that

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,149
dominate the clay fraction and I also

257
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,769
did some extractions that show that

258
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,750
there's a decent amount of crystalline

259
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,610
iron oxides in the soil that might have

260
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,899
a pretty pretty big impact on the

261
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,039
surface reactivity of the mineral

262
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:39,049
particles so really

263
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,629
the bulk carbon-nitrogen distributions

264
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:43,578
of the soils here we kind of see the the

265
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:45,740
textbook trend that you would expect to

266
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:48,828
see with depth knowledge where the

267
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,509
surface layer is kind of modernized as

268
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:52,909
far as the carbon contents and nitrogen

269
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,769
contents is well are concerned followed

270
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:57,679
by a pretty precipitous drop-off in the

271
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,240
subsoil and this isn't the case for the

272
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,250
no-till soils where we kind of start off

273
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,870
generally with higher concentrations of

274
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,909
carbon and nitrogen and then we get more

275
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:10,578
of a gradual decrease as we would expect

276
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:12,078
in a system with less disturbance so the

277
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:13,849
dissolved organic matter itself kind of

278
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,370
follows a somewhat of a similar trend

279
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,129
where the organic matter in dissolve

280
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,139
fraction the contents I should say Orca

281
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:23,528
modernize within the plow layer we also

282
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:26,240
get this quick drop-off below that and

283
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:28,939
again no-till system it's more of a

284
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,060
gradual type decrease and this is true

285
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,769
for both the carbon and the nitrogen and

286
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:36,739
if we look at the carbon nitrogen ratios

287
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,959
of the dissolved organic fraction we can

288
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,959
see that generally speaking with depth

289
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,939
the c2n ratio goes up I present this

290
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,309
because I'm kind of going back to that a

291
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,350
concept of carbon nitrogen ratio playing

292
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,838
an influence in a selective absorption

293
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,870
of GOM so that's something to keep in

294
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,870
mind

295
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:57,110
so some of the optical characterization

296
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,240
now we're looking at the more molecular

297
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,659
composition of the organic matter this

298
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,600
is the specific UV absorbance at 2:54 we

299
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:07,490
can see that with both of these soils

300
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,110
there's a decrease in the Suva to 54

301
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,029
with depth suggesting that dissolved

302
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,269
organic matter becomes less aromatic in

303
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:15,980
the subsoils and similarly in addition

304
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,519
to the bulk and the dissolved organic

305
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,990
matter just raw content we see its

306
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
molecular composition of the dissolved

307
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,580
organic matter also the distribution is

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,110
influenced by a by tillage somewhat we

309
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:32,629
get a surface from aaj an ad again so

310
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,310
now I'm going to talk about dissolved

311
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,350
organic matter he fluorescence

312
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:37,459
excitation emission matrices these look

313
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,399
really scary but they're actually really

314
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,910
cool and I'm hoping to kind of convince

315
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,340
you of that

316
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,870
so dissolved organic matter samples

317
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,330
again they're complex so there's a lot

318
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,629
of stuff in these and one of the ways

319
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,650
that uh water and soil chemists like to

320
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,600
characterize this is using this

321
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,730
technique which basically probes the

322
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,490
fluorescence emission of the dissolved

323
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,070
organic matter sample at stepped

324
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,779
excitation wavelengths what happens is

325
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,330
doing this you can create an excitation

326
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,189
landscape or a fluorescence landscape I

327
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,360
guess I should say that's going to look

328
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,400
differently based on the molecular

329
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,669
composition and source of the dissolved

330
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,409
organic matter I'm not I like to

331
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:17,479
generally break it up in the two classes

332
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:20,299
one of which is the less condensed

333
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,529
aromatics so that is individual aromatic

334
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:24,379
structures within the dissolved organic

335
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,179
matter and this oftentimes takes on the

336
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:29,299
forms of things like aromatic proteins

337
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:31,279
like tryptophan or phenylalanine but

338
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:33,169
also nucleic acids and other organic

339
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,839
acids we'll also first similarly to

340
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:38,449
these there's also

341
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,500
so the more condensed aromatic so I'm

342
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,940
probably shooting myself in the foot

343
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,679
here I'm going to use the terms you make

344
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,090
and fulvic acid for those that do

345
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,189
organic matter research you know that's

346
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,590
like taboo but this is the term that

347
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,090
people use in the literature for

348
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,649
characterizing these types of structures

349
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,080
these are more condensed so they have

350
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:58,069
fuse aromatics so the fluorescence is

351
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,870
redshifted because the homo-lumo gap is

352
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,230
altered by that that's another story for

353
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,389
another time so if we look at it for

354
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,980
look at these maps for the dissolve

355
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,210
organic matter fractions that I isolate

356
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,539
from you this course you can see some

357
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,250
pretty cool trends going on here so one

358
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:16,370
that occurred at every single site and

359
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,620
in all these cores with depth is we see

360
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,899
a reduction and the the fluorescent

361
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,879
behavior that corresponds with core

362
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,250
condensed aromatics and that's with

363
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,500
depth those features are removed as we

364
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,210
go further down the profile and what

365
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,860
becomes relatively more pronounced are

366
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,700
these more microbial product type

367
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,480
fluorescence landscapes and one last

368
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,710
thing I'd like to point out is yet again

369
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,850
tillage really kind of punctuated this

370
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,500
transition quite a bit so yeah so those

371
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,870
are the main points I wanted to kind of

372
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,899
get to you with these with that I'm

373
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,100
gonna summarize my field based work so

374
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,079
in addition to the known kind of

375
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,960
textbook trends in bulk carbon nitrogen

376
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,060
content of to a no-till soils we see

377
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,759
that is all organic matter content

378
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,289
reflects that where we see the surface

379
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,870
homogeneity within the plow layer

380
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:08,000
followed by a quick drop off in the

381
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,310
tilled system and more of a slow kind of

382
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,620
gradual decline where there's no tillage

383
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,879
being utilized as for the

384
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,560
characteristics of the dissolved organic

385
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,470
matter they follow a pretty similar

386
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:21,289
trend with that surface heterogeneity a

387
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,060
quick punctuation of the trends and we

388
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:24,349
see that we look at the molecular

389
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,599
characteristics of the dissolved organic

390
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,600
matter their carbon to nitrogen ratio

391
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,730
increases with depth aromaticity goes

392
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,409
down with depth and the presence of more

393
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,019
condensed aromatic structures goes down

394
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:38,569
with depth and this kind of has the

395
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,309
fingerprint of selective adsorption of a

396
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,050
GOM as it percolates throughout the

397
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:44,750
profile these features in and of

398
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,429
themselves do but this little hitch here

399
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,480
has me thinking a little bit differently

400
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,679
because

401
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,360
soluble micro

402
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,909
products things like proteins nucleic

403
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,190
acids tend to adsorb pretty readily in

404
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:57,559
soils as well which makes me wonder if

405
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,870
perhaps lower in these soil profiles

406
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,699
where we have high reactive mineral

407
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,980
surface area and very little organic

408
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,930
carbon if the biota that are down there

409
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,430
are perhaps releasing things into the

410
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,899
soil solution that might be kind of

411
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:12,379
dominating the dynamic down there as

412
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,750
opposed to selective absorption so with

413
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:17,419
this kind of high reactive mineral

414
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,490
surface area a protein nucleic acid

415
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:21,169
mindset I'm going to jump in out of my

416
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,700
laboratory studies looking at the

417
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:27,379
interactions of biomolecules with

418
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,910
mineral surfaces so a little bit one

419
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,169
more quick piece of background I'm sure

420
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:32,649
you guys have seen this model before I

421
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:35,240
think Angela showed it during her talk

422
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,799
this is a model that was proposed by

423
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,580
Markus Kleber and associates about

424
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,139
decade ago and they kind of constructed

425
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,240
this hypothetical model here to help

426
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,830
explain some of the multi-layer organic

427
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
matter associations we see in soil

428
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,940
profiles and they've built off of this

429
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,430
observation that biomolecules interact

430
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:56,650
strongly with mineral surfaces and in

431
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:58,819
this model the multi-layer formation is

432
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:01,458
hinging upon the presence of this

433
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,430
contact that is supposedly a biomolecule

434
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:07,179
rich directly at the mineral surface the

435
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,379
biomolecule rich later excuse me that

436
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,799
forms when biomolecules adsorbed

437
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:14,570
directly on the mineral surface undergo

438
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,549
conformational rearrangements and then

439
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,650
more organic matter can adsorb on top of

440
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:20,629
them forming the multi layers leading to

441
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,870
stabilization in this multi layered type

442
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:25,759
architecture so biomolecules are really

443
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,379
important believed to be important for

444
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,450
that reason and also one thing I'd like

445
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:31,338
to point out is the conformational

446
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,060
rearrangements or believed to make this

447
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,800
all possible

448
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,119
so we're also really important and I'll

449
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:40,370
talk more about the conformation in a

450
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,320
bit so to probe's this question

451
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,828
experimentally in the lab by utilized a

452
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,360
few models use a model protein a bovine

453
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:52,759
serum albumin and I used a model DNA so

454
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,600
the protein I use a bovine serum albumin

455
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,740
is a globular protein and it has a

456
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,290
secondary structure that is largely

457
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,519
composed of alpha helixes that's these

458
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:03,269
kind of these really tightly wound

459
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,288
regions sure

460
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:07,689
these are connected by these long

461
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:09,369
extended chains that are more extended

462
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,889
in open type structures there are also

463
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:15,219
some more internalized term type

464
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:16,838
elements there as well and the DNA that

465
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,548
was use comes from herring testes this

466
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:22,599
is kind of a standard physical chemical

467
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:24,519
model for a DNA experiment

468
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,068
it's a double-stranded be form of DNA

469
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,138
and this when you pick up a bottle of

470
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:31,089
herring testis DNA what's in there it's

471
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:33,459
kind of long it's you get a really long

472
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,980
size distribution of DNA right out of

473
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,899
the bottle so what I did is I decided

474
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,730
I'm going to share this to a known size

475
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,768
because size can be an important factor

476
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,750
looking at absorption by wooden to share

477
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,548
it to a known just known size with a

478
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,528
relatively tight size distribution to

479
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:50,950
eliminate that as an influencing factor

480
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:52,028
here and for both these biomolecules I

481
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,429
think it's important to point out that

482
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:57,609
under my experimental conditions of five

483
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:59,080
milli molar KCl background at pH 5 these

484
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,869
biomolecules are both going to have a

485
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,250
negative charge on them it's a net

486
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:08,109
negative charge both will still have

487
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:10,359
regions of positive charge so I used two

488
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:12,038
different model mineral surfaces one of

489
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,699
which is potassium saturated

490
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:15,638
montmorillonite

491
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,450
I use good old swy tube at night for

492
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:19,079
those that have worked with this before

493
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,429
it's a lot of fun this is a two-to-one

494
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,849
aluminosilicate clay mineral meaning it

495
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:26,380
has two of these tetrahedral units or

496
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:28,839
layers I should say as shown by this

497
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,990
brownish color and one octahedral sheet

498
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,908
as shown here by the gray the gray layer

499
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,038
and this specific montmorillonite is

500
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,840
bentonite has a permanent negative

501
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,019
structural charge that's situated in

502
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:43,599
that central octahedral layer and that

503
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,888
imparts a certain shrink swell behavior

504
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,548
to this clay that gives it a really nice

505
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:50,288
higher reactive surface area and unlike

506
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:52,269
the montmorillonite i used another

507
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:55,528
mineral called ger tight named after the

508
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:58,440
german poet and hobby geologist Goethe

509
00:18:55,528 --> 00:19:00,460
that is an iron oxyhydroxide

510
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,139
unlike the montmorillonite this is not

511
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,590
negatively charged this is positively

512
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:07,000
charged at the pH values use but similar

513
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:08,798
to the mom Roland I it has a very high

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,500
reactive surface area as one could

515
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,658
predict from looking at the mineral

516
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,099
structure so this is an SEM image of the

517
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,600
minerals that I used in my experiments

518
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,789
you can tell you're quite small

519
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,679
they range from maybe a few hundred

520
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,509
nanometers up to a couple of microns in

521
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,920
length and they're very very thin so

522
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:29,589
they have a nice high reactive service

523
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,360
area again we're looking at biomolecule

524
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:33,699
absorption to a couple different

525
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,019
surfaces here biomolecules are kind of

526
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,259
complicated to study the surface

527
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:41,049
behavior of so like other molecules that

528
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:42,460
absorb the surfaces they have adsorption

529
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,349
rate constants that can be informative

530
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,880
about the process they have equilibrium

531
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,009
surface coverages that can also be

532
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,450
informative about the process and they

533
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:51,160
have this tendency to undergo

534
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,700
conformational adjustments as I kind of

535
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,630
alluded to earlier and ideally when

536
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,920
we're going to study the adsorption

537
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,810
we're gonna be able to capture all these

538
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,850
things we're gonna be able to do so

539
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:03,009
without having to drive the system which

540
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:04,599
could artificially change the

541
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,910
confirmation we're gonna do so without

542
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,259
making a system get too hot too salty

543
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:13,060
or anything else that's gonna make it

544
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:15,700
kind of artificially conformed so to do

545
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,289
this I use a technique known as Institue

546
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,809
attenuated total reflectance Fourier

547
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:24,099
transform infrared spectroscopy say that

548
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:27,460
110 times fast or ATR FTIR and this is a

549
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,659
form of vibrational spectroscopy as you

550
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,910
can probably tell from looking at those

551
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,190
cheesy little cartoons right there but

552
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,840
what separates this from other forms of

553
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,410
vibrational spectroscopy like

554
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,970
traditional infrared is this ATR part so

555
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,779
this has what's called an internal

556
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,329
reflective element in which the infrared

557
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,759
light is shined into this internal

558
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:51,220
reflective element we have a diamond one

559
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,680
and it's reflected off and as its

560
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,769
reflected it's not a totally efficient

561
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,410
reflection as nothing truly is so we get

562
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,779
this loss of energy upon reflection that

563
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,430
is propagated perpendicularly from the

564
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:05,829
surface of this diamond that allows us

565
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,539
to use it as a sampling surface

566
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:10,779
basically and what I did for my

567
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:13,180
experiments is I coated the diamond in a

568
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,789
mineral film and watched as the

569
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,259
biomolecules adsorbed to the surface

570
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,089
using this technique I was able to get

571
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:23,230
adsorption kinetic data equilibrium

572
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:25,149
surface coverage stuff some mechanistic

573
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,430
conformational information and I was

574
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,840
able to do this in solution so I don't

575
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,549
have to worry about confounding factors

576
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,389
there either

577
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,859
so with that I'm going to move on to

578
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,140
some of my studies looking at the

579
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:39,649
association of the protein BSA with the

580
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,950
clay montmorillonite so this is an

581
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,690
infrared spectrum of DSA and it has

582
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,150
three features you're going to typically

583
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,830
see an F G IR spectra of proteins has

584
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,840
the M at one two and three Peaks that

585
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:53,899
correspond with backbone vibrations on

586
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,220
the protein and in my studies I'm going

587
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,580
to show results from the Hammad one in

588
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:01,069
two regions so the one M at one region

589
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:02,119
contains all of the structural info so

590
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:05,210
that's where I'm going to look and say

591
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:07,969
hey the protein is unfolding or not M

592
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,039
into this is gonna be my quantifying

593
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,730
region for BSA adsorption on the surface

594
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:16,309
and what's shown here is kind of a time

595
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,650
series of BSA on the clay surface so as

596
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,289
the BSA adsorbs to give a higher and

597
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,810
higher and higher signal and when we go

598
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,220
ahead and plot our amma to peak here

599
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,460
against time we can look at our

600
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,049
adsorption kinetics and for the four

601
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,720
different concentrations used in this

602
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,849
study you can see that the adsorption

603
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,190
kinetics follow a certain logarithmic

604
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:39,349
time dependence and that suggests that

605
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,330
the energetic barrier is associated with

606
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:43,339
adsorption are heterogeneous so it's not

607
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:46,519
a single activation energy here it's a

608
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:47,959
distribution of energies and it's not

609
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,329
entirely evident just from these curves

610
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,769
but I'll show why I believe this later

611
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,869
this is likely attributable to

612
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:56,119
continuous protein rearrangement on the

613
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:58,609
surface protein lateral interactions

614
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:01,659
with other adsorbed proteins or

615
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:04,819
potentially electrostatic heterogeneity

616
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,800
so we look at our equilibrium surface

617
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:09,019
coverage results we can see that they're

618
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,879
fit reasonably well by this black line

619
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:14,450
here this is the the classic Langmuir

620
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,250
adsorption isotherm and the main thing i

621
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,950
want to point out here is you know this

622
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,390
model has a built in K value which

623
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,680
corresponds with the kind of the

624
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,600
affinity or the strength of the

625
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,670
adsorption and if you look at this

626
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,829
number here 5.9 seven times ten to the

627
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,320
fifth that's a pretty big number so the

628
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:32,210
protein as we are kind of already more

629
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,658
or less new adsorbs really strongly to

630
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,190
the clay surface

631
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,809
there absorbs and the kinetics are

632
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,389
logarithmic what about the structure the

633
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:44,749
conformation I keep talking about that

634
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:46,969
what what does that look like so if we

635
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,649
first consider here the native secondary

636
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,690
structure of the BSA as shown by these

637
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:53,028
dotted lines you see again it's

638
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,740
primarily off gila sees with some more

639
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:57,740
extended chains and turns kind of mixed

640
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,509
into the secondary structure but we look

641
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,200
at the secondary structure of the BSA on

642
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,940
montmorillonite

643
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,278
you see that a few things are happening

644
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,169
here and primarily I'd like to draw your

645
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:09,079
attention to this lowest concentration

646
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:09,710
in corresponding surface coverage at

647
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,609
this value

648
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:15,889
it seems that VSA indeed unfolds and we

649
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:17,418
see an increase in these expanded kind

650
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:19,519
of extended chains and turn type

651
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:22,700
structures that are more open and this

652
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:26,118
comes at the expense of more condensed

653
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,190
alpha helical regions but interestingly

654
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:30,349
as we look at the BSA adsorbed at higher

655
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,808
concentrations and surface coverages it

656
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:35,109
starts to look more and more like native

657
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:38,148
BSA in terms of its secondary structure

658
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:39,798
so these values are all from equilibrium

659
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:42,229
so that's the very end of my experiments

660
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:44,329
question is does the protein it's Orban

661
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,099
this way and stay there or is it adsorb

662
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:47,990
and kind of flop around and find the

663
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:50,269
energetically most favorable state on

664
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,058
the mineral surface and to address this

665
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:56,240
question I use a technique known as 2d

666
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:57,470
correlation spectroscopic analysis and

667
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,878
I'm not going to get into the details of

668
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,679
this right now but if you guys have any

669
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:02,118
questions about it I would love love

670
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:05,720
love love to talk about it this is

671
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:07,099
fascinating and this technique makes use

672
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,669
of what is known as a synchronous and

673
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:13,368
asynchronous plot to look at sequential

674
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:16,460
changes to the protein structure with

675
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:19,278
adsorption time and when we apply this

676
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,889
analysis to the data that I have we see

677
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,970
that there are at least two different

678
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:25,069
conformational pathways that we can see

679
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,528
one is that this lowest BSA

680
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,898
concentration or the protein adsorbs and

681
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:32,569
with time we see an increase in open

682
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:35,928
structures here and the loss of the more

683
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:37,759
compact alpha helixes at the higher BSA

684
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:40,309
concentrations the sequence looks a

685
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,950
little bit different you see that as the

686
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:45,950
protein is on the surface we actually

687
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,879
see an increase in aggregated strands so

688
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,960
that is kind of inter molecular

689
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,428
structures

690
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,759
so a higher surface coverage is that

691
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:56,298
kind of makes sense have more neighbors

692
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:58,909
hmm we see a decrease in these more open

693
00:25:56,298 --> 00:26:00,349
turns and extended chains with time so

694
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,879
there are two pathways that occurring

695
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,798
there one where the BSA it's orbs it

696
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:05,480
becomes more open another one where it

697
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,778
absorbs and becomes more compact and

698
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,700
internalized with time so I'm gonna

699
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:15,710
quickly summarize this here at the one

700
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,700
thing is evident from these studies BSA

701
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,079
does absorb pretty strongly on clay but

702
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,759
we already kind of knew that as a

703
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,730
scientific community but this really

704
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,720
demonstrated though is that not only as

705
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,038
a confirmation change but it's a dynamic

706
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,129
confirmation on the surface and as a

707
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,648
dynamic pathway that differs based on

708
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:39,109
the surface coverages themselves we're

709
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:41,508
at the lowest VSA concentrations use the

710
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:43,069
BSA's orbs it opens up at the higher

711
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:46,999
concentrations at its orbs and becomes

712
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:49,220
more aggregated so now I'm going to move

713
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:52,490
on to some more studies that I've done

714
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,868
with BSA and DNA this time on another

715
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,009
mineral surface it's the ger tied to

716
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:59,868
more needle looking things before I do

717
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,999
that I'm going to quickly show an FTIR

718
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:04,668
spectrum of DNA this is a vibrational

719
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:07,579
spectrum of DNA and solution and similar

720
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,799
to the protein we see some vibrational

721
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:11,839
modes that are attributable to backbone

722
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:13,940
vibrations so we have the phosphodiester

723
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,298
groups from these phosphonate groups or

724
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:19,278
phosphodiester groups here stretching

725
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:20,839
asymmetric and symmetric modes and we

726
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,579
also have some carbon oxygen and carbon

727
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,308
carbon stretching from the backbone

728
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:27,499
showing up as well and similar to the a

729
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:29,628
mid to of protein I use this backbone

730
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:31,970
carbon-carbon stretching mode as my

731
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:34,339
quantifier for DNA adsorption I've

732
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:39,558
verified this using another technique so

733
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:41,509
it's it's good to go so some of the

734
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,368
results here start off with the BSA

735
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,220
first thing I'd like to point out I'm

736
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:48,168
now working on units of mass base

737
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,240
concentration rather than molarity to

738
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,809
make the correspondence between the

739
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,159
protein and DNA a little bit easier we

740
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:56,569
can see the kinetics here look a little

741
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,309
bit different than a denim Amarone

742
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:01,548
especially at the lower concentrations

743
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:05,898
used wherein we have this kind of

744
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:07,940
mudal logistic type curve correspond to

745
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:10,518
these adsorption kinetics there's this

746
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,470
lag phase that these this connects have

747
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,899
built into it and then the protein

748
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,700
literature with surface absorption this

749
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:18,349
lag phase is a correspond with a kind of

750
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,759
cooperative clustering effect of the

751
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:21,589
protein on the surface where the

752
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,118
kinetics are really really slow until we

753
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:24,408
get a certain base layer surface

754
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:28,009
coverage in which case it really kind of

755
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:29,419
starts to take off you notice when we go

756
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:33,019
to higher concentrations that isn't

757
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:34,730
quite as apparent DNA on the other hand

758
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,759
these are the adsorption kinetics for

759
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,889
DNA encore tight they kind of follow a

760
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,950
classic first-order adsorption meaning

761
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:45,138
the the adsorption is rate limited by

762
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,288
energetic barriers as opposed to mass

763
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:50,418
transfer or some kind of a clustering

764
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:57,648
effect and furthermore as a single

765
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:59,210
energetic barrier it's not a range again

766
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,599
we look at the equilibrium isotherms

767
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,690
here

768
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,878
so both BSA and DNA have pretty good

769
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,690
high affinity isotherms here as you can

770
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:10,028
tell from the shapes of the curve but

771
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,288
it's pretty apparent we look at the

772
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:15,200
affinity coefficients that come out of

773
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:16,788
the Langmuir equation here that DNA

774
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,269
tends words were quite a bit more

775
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:22,638
strongly actually that's something I'll

776
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:26,929
kind of link in the next slide or two to

777
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:28,488
the structure of the adsorb DNA so the

778
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:29,720
conformation what happens to the

779
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:32,720
conformation is it like montmorillonite

780
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,190
where we see unfolding well I think the

781
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,489
trends are fairly similar it looks like

782
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,109
the lowest concentration of BSA used we

783
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:41,929
see something quite similar where we see

784
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:44,118
an unfolding of the BSA and opening up

785
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:47,749
of extended chains at the expense of

786
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:50,178
more condensed alpha helix C's at the

787
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:52,249
higher concentration is used we can see

788
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:55,509
that again it looks more like native BSA

789
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,509
similar to the mom ruolan i

790
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:02,899
for DNA we see some we can excuse me we

791
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,670
can see some very clear direct evidence

792
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,769
that there's bond formation between DNA

793
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:10,490
and the go tight one piece of evidence

794
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:12,680
is these XPS spectra here so I'm not

795
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,509
going to get into the details of XPS in

796
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,450
essence this peak shift here about point

797
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:19,460
seven electron volts for the phosphorous

798
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,529
spectrum is in line with what you'd see

799
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,930
for like a phosphate adsorption on Farah

800
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,160
hydrate or something which corresponds

801
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,660
really clearly with an inner sphere of

802
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,279
coordination between this phosphodiester

803
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,850
group on the backbone in the ger tight

804
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:33,799
surface if we look at the infrared

805
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:35,839
spectra of DNA adsorbed in in solution

806
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,119
we can see further evidence for direct

807
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,099
inner sphere coordination so in solution

808
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,009
there's kind of this valley here between

809
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,469
these Peaks and when DNA adsorbs we get

810
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,509
this nice big peak pops up at ten

811
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,279
hundred and ten wave numbers and if you

812
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:50,619
look in the literature here this

813
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,369
corresponds really strongly with

814
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:56,109
computational studies that have shown

815
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:59,629
that there's most likely an iron oxygen

816
00:30:56,109 --> 00:31:03,589
phosphorus stretching bond forming there

817
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,000
and further evidence for this is if we

818
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:06,799
look at higher energies at the

819
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,529
asymmetric stretching modes of the

820
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,269
backbone phosphodiester group we see a

821
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:13,129
shift of about seven or eight wave

822
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:16,789
numbers upon it sorption to a lower

823
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,890
energy and interestingly this shift here

824
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:21,619
could also be indicative the

825
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,070
conformational change of DNA from the B

826
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:27,609
form that initially started in to a more

827
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:29,899
expanded a optically different Z form

828
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:32,179
but if we look elsewhere in the spectrum

829
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,210
of DNA we don't see any of the other

830
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,740
indicators at a z form has indeed popped

831
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,480
up

832
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,490
suggesting that the DNA adsorbs in the B

833
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,430
form and doesn't necessarily undergo any

834
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,609
conformational changes but we do get

835
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,630
this inner sphere bond forming so to

836
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:51,109
quickly wrap this up

837
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,750
both PSA and DNA do adsorb strongly on

838
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,129
go type there are some differences in

839
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,660
the kinetics BSA at the low

840
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,600
concentrations has this kind of lag

841
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:02,930
phase where as DNA is just straight-up

842
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,089
first-order all the way conformational e

843
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,299
it looks like BSA again does kind of

844
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:10,039
unfold on these surfaces at lower

845
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,329
concentrations at least or surface

846
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:15,859
coverages whereas a higher surface

847
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:18,889
coverage is not so much for DNA no large

848
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:21,379
kind of long order conformational change

849
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,030
seems to occur at being said there is an

850
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,370
inner sphere bond that appears to occur

851
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:26,839
between the backbone phosphodiester

852
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,929
group and the ger tight surface and this

853
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,849
is a really nice strong stable bond and

854
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:34,490
that's the angst room component of this

855
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:37,519
work so got to highlight that so there

856
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,839
is a direct bond forming there so what

857
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,639
happens when we mix them together in

858
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:42,649
solution and which look and see how they

859
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,360
absorb when they're together I mean one

860
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,100
could very easily build up the argument

861
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,539
based on the kinetic results where

862
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:49,879
there's that lag phase in the protein

863
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:51,559
and the equilibrium isotherms where we

864
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,120
have this real nice higher affinity with

865
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,950
the DNA you could easily say we're gonna

866
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,529
put them both together and DNA is gonna

867
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,640
preferentially adsorb on the surface

868
00:32:56,529 --> 00:33:00,920
well I don't want to spoil anything too

869
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,990
much but when you mix molecules together

870
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,220
in solution have a tendency to undergo

871
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:08,450
what is called super molecular assembly

872
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,390
and this is really important for two

873
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:13,430
reasons one of the main reasons is as

874
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,800
molecules in solution spontaneously

875
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,060
assemble to form these aggregates the

876
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:20,149
properties of the Constituent

877
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,069
biomolecules change a lot and it's very

878
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,110
interesting to see how that could

879
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:26,359
possibly translate to the surface

880
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:27,379
behavior at the mineral surface and

881
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,159
there haven't been too many studies

882
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,100
leading up to this that I've

883
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,930
demonstrated anything and one more thing

884
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:34,969
that's really important about this is we

885
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,220
know we've known for decades actually a

886
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,750
super molecular assembly does occur in

887
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,569
dissolve organic matter amongst those

888
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,109
components so it has a more than a wee

889
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:46,339
bit of environmental relevance as well

890
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,809
so for these studies what I did is I

891
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:49,970
made a series of super molecular

892
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:52,609
complexes and these are made by using a

893
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,049
fixed DNA concentration and it was

894
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:56,929
titrated with different amounts of

895
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:59,180
protein in solution and once these

896
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,830
complexes are formed a character I is

897
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,990
the extent to which they bind how

898
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:05,329
strongly do they associate I

899
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,740
characterized the charge characteristics

900
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:09,469
of the complex is relative to the

901
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,880
constituent biomolecules and I look at

902
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,529
the complex as you fellows and I said

903
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,240
hey how are you guys interacting with

904
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,240
each other i characterized that as well

905
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,700
so looking at some of the

906
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,098
here this is kind of the extent of

907
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,989
binding here on the left hand side this

908
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,269
is an equilibrium binding curve between

909
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,579
protein and DNA as derived from a

910
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:30,989
technique called circular dichroism and

911
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,210
there are two main things I'd like to

912
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:35,128
draw your attention to here one of which

913
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,559
is this the shape of the binding curve

914
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:39,019
again it has that S shape that we saw

915
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,039
for the kinetics of protein adsorption

916
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:43,289
and this suggests that there are some

917
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,599
cooperativity amongst the proteins bound

918
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:48,119
to the DNA so when one adsorbs or binds

919
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,899
it's more likely to make further binding

920
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,240
more favourable and one other thing here

921
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:57,989
is this the binding saturation is

922
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,659
reached on the DNA at a protein DNA

923
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:02,309
ratio of about 15 so at this point when

924
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,129
we add more protein to the system it's

925
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:06,838
not binding directly to the DNA because

926
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,670
we've reached a saturation on the DNA

927
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:13,049
helix itself so and I'd the K value that

928
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,599
comes out of this is really high it's on

929
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,070
the order of five or six times 10 to the

930
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,750
fifth I didn't put it up here because

931
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,910
it's not quantitatively useable because

932
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,099
it's actually a strong underestimate of

933
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:27,838
the real case but it is it's proof that

934
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:29,369
this binding is quite strong we see the

935
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,409
charge characteristics of the complexes

936
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:34,130
are fairly unique as well we're starting

937
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:36,690
with DNA that has a relatively high

938
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,900
electro phoretic mobility so that means

939
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:42,000
it has a large negative charge on it BSA

940
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,039
is up here just below zero so it's not

941
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,108
quite as negative it's just got a little

942
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:47,750
bit of negative charge this pH there you

943
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:52,858
can see that as we combine them and make

944
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:54,329
complexes of mixed BSA DNA ratios the

945
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:55,799
negative charge in the complexes goes

946
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:58,619
down so we change the charge

947
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,800
characteristics here as well so how does

948
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,910
these complexes interact in solution

949
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,369
this is where a technique known as

950
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:07,409
dynamic light scattering comes in this

951
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:09,180
is a set of light scattering curves here

952
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:10,858
by scattering distributions where we

953
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:13,519
have relaxation time on the x axis

954
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:18,239
arbitrary intensity on the y axis and

955
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:20,400
what we have here is DNA with increasing

956
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,399
amounts of BSA added to the system and

957
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,869
BSA by itself and there's two main

958
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,519
features I'd like to draw your attention

959
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:30,150
to on these relaxation time

960
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,050
distributions one is the fast mode the

961
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,470
fast relaxation mode peak

962
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:38,080
of DNA which corresponds with the

963
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:41,619
diffusion of individual DNA HeLa sees

964
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,170
through solution so it's a got a higher

965
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:46,059
diffusion time associated with it then

966
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,980
there is this slow relaxation mode which

967
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:51,070
is a concerted diffusion so we know that

968
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,539
DNA heal season solution at this pH have

969
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,000
a negative charge on them from electro

970
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:56,500
phoretic mobility and negative charges

971
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,690
have a tendency to kind of repel each

972
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,159
other so as we have a lot of these DNA

973
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,079
he will season solution they're kind of

974
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,029
afraid to do anything because they can't

975
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,319
get too close or too far from anything

976
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,750
because they're surrounded by negative

977
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,030
charges and then analogy I like to use

978
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:15,369
to kind of conceptualize this is that of

979
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:17,860
the J so we have here are a couple of

980
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:21,159
McDonnell Douglas f-18 Hornets so these

981
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:23,260
Jets I looked this up earlier when you

982
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,849
have one of these as is and it's going

983
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,160
full-throttle these things can go about

984
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,259
1,300 miles per hour but when they're

985
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,629
flying in formation as the Blue Angels

986
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,740
are here I kind of have to slow down a

987
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,690
little bit because if they're going

988
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:36,539
full-throttle

989
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,679
it's much more difficult for them to

990
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:39,849
maneuver and control themselves with

991
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:41,230
respect to their neighbors they can't

992
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:43,269
get too close or very bad things are

993
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,420
going to happen DNA in solution is very

994
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:48,340
similar so the mass on mass diffusion of

995
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,480
the DNA is a lot slower and that's what

996
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:54,220
creates this slow relaxation mode here

997
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,889
and we can see as we add BSA to the

998
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:58,809
system a few things happen one of which

999
00:37:56,889 --> 00:38:00,940
is this slowmode peak that corresponds

1000
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:03,369
with the diffusion of individual DNA

1001
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,829
helixes it shifts to higher relaxation

1002
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,869
times that is a slower diffusion of the

1003
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:09,579
molecule in solution so if you go back

1004
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,389
and look at this folks Einstein equation

1005
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:15,039
from which these curves are derived

1006
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:18,489
that's most likely a higher mass that's

1007
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:20,559
making us happen and additionally this

1008
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:23,409
the slow mode peak arises from this

1009
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,599
intermolecular repulsion of the DNA is

1010
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:27,730
really really really dampened as we have

1011
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,630
VSA to the system suggesting that

1012
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,809
there's a breakdown in that

1013
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:33,220
intermolecular repulsion and one last

1014
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,440
thing I'd like to point out on these

1015
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:38,439
light scattering results is even when we

1016
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,889
get above this a saturation finding

1017
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,028
saturation of DNA BSA that's added isn't

1018
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:46,978
free you know we don't see this free

1019
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:49,168
translational diffusion tsa here

1020
00:38:46,978 --> 00:38:51,149
suggesting at the BSA is still kind of

1021
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:56,338
under the influence of these complexes

1022
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:58,918
as well so I'll quickly recap here we

1023
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:02,068
have DNA we add BSA to it we make

1024
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:04,168
complexes that grow larger the negative

1025
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:05,548
charge on the complex is becomes lesser

1026
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:07,768
and lesser as we add protein to the

1027
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:09,509
system likely through electrostatic

1028
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:11,758
interactions between positively charged

1029
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:15,208
domains on the protein and/or side

1030
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:16,619
chains and as this happens the

1031
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:19,889
electrostatic repulsion between the

1032
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:22,169
complexes breaks down and as we add

1033
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:24,719
protein to the system even above binding

1034
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:28,768
saturation the BSA isn't free and it's

1035
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,639
still in loose Association complexes so

1036
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,629
what happens when we take these

1037
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:35,429
complexes and absorb them on the surface

1038
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,559
this is a set of FTIR spectrum from one

1039
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:41,249
of my adsorption experiments and we can

1040
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:44,609
see that as the complexes absorb the

1041
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:47,368
protein component amid - and my DNA

1042
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:50,098
quantifier is backbone and CC mode you

1043
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,479
can see them both clearly with time and

1044
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,539
if we look at the composition of the

1045
00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:55,978
adsorb material with time at these lower

1046
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:57,929
experimental ratios it's more or less

1047
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,489
pretty flat suggesting that the

1048
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:02,009
speciation of the adsorbed material

1049
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:04,219
doesn't exhibit any discrimination and

1050
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:05,998
the complexes are just kind of absorbing

1051
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:09,479
it's a bit of a different situation

1052
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:12,629
though when we move to the highest ratio

1053
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:15,298
used so this is above saturation point

1054
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:19,650
on the binding curve where wherein we

1055
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:22,139
see an early dip in the protein to DNA

1056
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,608
ratio of what's absorbed suggesting that

1057
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:26,150
early in the absorption process

1058
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:28,348
kinetically speaking correctly speaking

1059
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:31,829
we have more protein adsorbed to the

1060
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:33,689
surface and with time it kind of

1061
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:36,839
stabilizes but it still results in an

1062
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:39,538
equilibrium protein DNA value that is

1063
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,900
disproportionately large and this

1064
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:46,619
suggests to me that maybe we're getting

1065
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,059
some early dissociation in these

1066
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,469
complexes and the proteins that are

1067
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,298
peripherally associated with these

1068
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:54,059
complexes are rapidly absorbing

1069
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:56,699
initially in the process and then

1070
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:58,169
perhaps the complex is without with the

1071
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:00,499
perfectly adsorbed protein will then

1072
00:40:58,168 --> 00:41:00,498
adsorb

1073
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:08,739
so we look at the equilibrium results if

1074
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:12,349
we look at the amount of DNA adsorbed as

1075
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:14,809
again given shown by this backbone CC

1076
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:16,459
peak you can see that the amount of DNA

1077
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:18,829
adsorbed as we have protein to this

1078
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:20,028
system actually goes up which is kind of

1079
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:22,219
interesting one way to make more

1080
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:24,588
biomolecules more competition for

1081
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:27,619
surface sites that's not necessarily the

1082
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:29,268
case here now I believe this is a low

1083
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:31,789
tribute wall to the electrostatic

1084
00:41:29,268 --> 00:41:33,768
repulsion that is reduced by the

1085
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,599
addition of the protein so DNA

1086
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:38,328
adsorption on surfaces is often time is

1087
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,548
limited by the actual electrostatic

1088
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,449
footprint of the DNA helix because we

1089
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,458
know they don't like to get close to

1090
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:45,858
each other they just doesn't like it

1091
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:47,748
they don't like it no one does so when

1092
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:49,458
we take these complexes and we add a BSA

1093
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:52,338
to the system we make them less

1094
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:56,629
repulsive to each other the surface is

1095
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:58,038
able to accommodate more DNA but this

1096
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,429
isn't always the case when we move to

1097
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:04,069
the concentrations of BSA that go beyond

1098
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:05,539
what the DNA itself can accommodate we

1099
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:09,018
actually kind of see this sharp drop off

1100
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,459
again suggesting to me that maybe those

1101
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:12,379
kinetic results are really onto

1102
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:14,448
something maybe we're getting some

1103
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,039
blocking of surface sites by quickly

1104
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:19,068
absorbed protein that's present

1105
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:22,999
preventing complexes from absorbing

1106
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:24,588
beyond that point and one last piece of

1107
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:27,558
result I would like to talk talk about

1108
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:30,528
real quick here is this this chart here

1109
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,869
at the bottom showing the peak height of

1110
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:37,219
the Fe o P peak so that is the extent of

1111
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:39,349
direct coordination divided by the CCP

1112
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:42,380
kite so that is the extent of direct

1113
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:46,818
coordination her DNA molecule in the

1114
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,528
system as we add BSA to the DNA we see

1115
00:42:46,818 --> 00:42:52,639
that the extent with direct coordination

1116
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:55,728
heard zorb DNA goes down so it looks to

1117
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,709
me that the BSA somehow is blocking

1118
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:59,418
direct coordination of DNA

1119
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,728
phosphodiester groups with the surface

1120
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:04,278
and whether this is through a direct

1121
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:06,048
interaction of the BSA let's say

1122
00:43:04,278 --> 00:43:09,498
electrostatically with the

1123
00:43:06,048 --> 00:43:12,699
phosphodiester groups or if it's more of

1124
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:14,230
a steric type locking simply

1125
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:16,629
preventing the groups from even touching

1126
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,130
the surface is uh I'm not certain yet

1127
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,769
but it seems to me that that's what's

1128
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:25,539
going on here creating kind of a protein

1129
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:27,789
bridge between the surface so quickly

1130
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:30,608
wrap this up we see that under the

1131
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:33,730
experimental conditions used BSA in d NH

1132
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:36,098
they do they get very involved with each

1133
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,108
other they bind very strongly we can see

1134
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:39,579
that this solution behavior simply as

1135
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:43,029
predicted from the equilibrium binding

1136
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:45,579
behavior it propagates itself in so many

1137
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:47,849
interesting ways in particularly in

1138
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:49,990
solution or you can see the

1139
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:51,160
intermolecular characteristics of the

1140
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:52,750
complexes are going to be altered

1141
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:54,279
greatly by it of the electrostatic

1142
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,608
characteristics are influenced greatly

1143
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,800
by it and I think perhaps most

1144
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:02,619
importantly for the you know thinking

1145
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,150
about soil organic matter and the

1146
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:06,190
behavior of biomolecules in the

1147
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,990
environment has a pretty big impact on

1148
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,400
what goes on to interface you know the

1149
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:11,559
both the binding mechanism and the

1150
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,240
amount of at least the DNA they're

1151
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:17,108
adsorbed is ultra greatly by this

1152
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,219
interaction and I think you know if you

1153
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:20,170
guys can remember back to that the

1154
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:22,838
Kleber model that I presented to had the

1155
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:25,088
multi-layer biomolecule formation on the

1156
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:27,429
mineral surface now those guys thought

1157
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:28,869
that you know biomolecules would absorb

1158
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:30,969
and then you'd have another adsorption

1159
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:32,140
event and then another I think this work

1160
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:34,389
kind of demonstrates that's not

1161
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:36,279
necessary in situations where we have

1162
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:38,559
super molecular association it's quite

1163
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,400
possible that a multi-layer of material

1164
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:44,049
could form in a single adsorption event

1165
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,369
so I'm going to quickly summarize the

1166
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,250
bulk of everything and hopefully still

1167
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:51,490
have time to take a few questions

1168
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:53,260
so in our field studies tillage seems to

1169
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:55,539
have a pretty big impact on vom dynamics

1170
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,310
so that surface inversion especially on

1171
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:59,469
the downstream processes so my question

1172
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:03,489
I think was a more or less kind of

1173
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:06,219
addressed and that includes both the

1174
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:08,769
amount with diem and also the the

1175
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:10,568
characteristics of DM and looking at the

1176
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:12,909
characteristics in the amount it's

1177
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:14,588
reasonable to assume that yeah sort of

1178
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:16,449
fractionation could be the culprit here

1179
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:18,400
for the removal but there are some

1180
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:20,108
hitches in there that suggests that in

1181
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,559
subsoils it might be more source driven

1182
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:25,509
by perhaps more resident microbial

1183
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,009
communities or something like that

1184
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,540
and if we kind of hone in on this this

1185
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,280
region down here we have a lot of

1186
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:33,710
reactive mineral surface area and

1187
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,750
microbial products would do some cool

1188
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,210
experimental lab studies at the

1189
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:41,090
molecular level we learned quite a few

1190
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:43,309
things there as well you learn that not

1191
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,019
only you do biomolecules absorb the

1192
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:48,170
surfaces and change conformation we do

1193
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:50,630
that but it's kind of a continuum it's a

1194
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:54,590
constant energetic struggle these

1195
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:56,809
biomolecules on the surface we see that

1196
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,220
at least with the case of ESA I'm

1197
00:45:56,809 --> 00:46:00,949
montmorillonite and I suspect some other

1198
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:02,599
proteins as well the pathway with which

1199
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:05,750
that occurs is going to change with

1200
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,960
surface coverage and again you know

1201
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:11,929
conformational and actual bonding type

1202
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,340
interactions drive a lot of the

1203
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:17,239
associations you see with dirt tight as

1204
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,650
well with those mineral surfaces and one

1205
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:21,849
final thing that we see is that when we

1206
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:24,170
combine these biomolecules in solution

1207
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:27,980
they interact in strange ways and they

1208
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:30,680
change the way that the constituents are

1209
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,300
retained at the surface so it's kind of

1210
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:35,119
a broad overview of what I just

1211
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,110
presented I'd like to quickly wrap up

1212
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,059
with some acknowledgments I'd like to

1213
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,920
thank my present lab group I'm

1214
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:41,420
particularly my advisor it's been a long

1215
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,730
strange ride but she's always giving me

1216
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,690
really great advice

1217
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,719
Taylor helped me out with getting some

1218
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:50,119
of the dissolve carbon nitrogen data I'm

1219
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,319
really thankful for that some past lab

1220
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:52,429
group members when I was still at Penn

1221
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,710
State they really kind of helped me

1222
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:56,960
understand the basics would being a grad

1223
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,309
student those are super valuable and I

1224
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,380
realized that until after the fact so

1225
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:03,949
that they're really great my committee

1226
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:05,150
members I went for or far far too many

1227
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:07,159
other friends and colleagues to

1228
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,460
name-drop here I see a lot of you in the

1229
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:12,859
audience I appreciate you showing up my

1230
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,929
funding sources obviously and you guys

1231
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,460
the audience for being here and I hope I

1232
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:18,909
have time to take a couple quick

1233
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,909
questions

1234
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:24,499
[Applause]

1235
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:41,240
my god

1236
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,760
if the CDN ratio and dissolved organic

1237
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:47,939
matter in the field is deep is

1238
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:52,080
increasing with depth yes that would

1239
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:55,309
imply that possibly could imply that in

1240
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:59,400
the surface you're getting preferential

1241
00:47:55,309 --> 00:48:05,039
absorption high in nitrogen containing

1242
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:07,440
compounds and so then that would then

1243
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,869
the expectation will be that microbial

1244
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,970
products surely will be lower in the

1245
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:15,000
surface than the subsoil that's right

1246
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:18,239
which was the opposite of unusual right

1247
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,039
I think that maybe at least in terms of

1248
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:24,439
the dissolved fraction what is being

1249
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,440
shown I think it might be driven more by

1250
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:30,300
microbial processing and byproducts in

1251
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:32,580
the subsoil itself rather than being

1252
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,590
transported from above I haven't done

1253
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:38,340
any studies to go beyond that kind of

1254
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:40,110
further but I think that was kind of a

1255
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,539
result that my first instinct was the

1256
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:46,769
same as yours you know microbe can be

1257
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:47,909
much more pronounced in this I haven't

1258
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:50,219
done anything you really follow up on

1259
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:53,429
that too much yet unfortunately the

1260
00:48:50,219 --> 00:49:24,329
fluorescence as itself isn't super super

1261
00:48:53,429 --> 00:49:26,039
strong identifying yes it doesn't

1262
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,750
actually change the characteristics that

1263
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,989
much so the circular dichroism that I

1264
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:32,179
used to characterize the binding

1265
00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:34,519
equilibrium

1266
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:35,719
you can get DNA conformational

1267
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,079
information out of that that's kind of

1268
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:40,338
what what and so the Pico is using

1269
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,410
looking at the change in a molar

1270
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:45,108
absorptivity of that peak that's a peak

1271
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:47,659
that's associated with the actual B form

1272
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:49,338
of the DNA and didn't seem like it was

1273
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:50,598
being altered further than got higher

1274
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:53,480
and higher because the abstract if 'ti

1275
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:57,740
was increasing so other indicator Peaks

1276
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:00,619
like a a or z form didn't seem to show

1277
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:03,318
up and single-stranded DNA don't absorb

1278
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:05,059
circularly polarized light at all yeah

1279
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:07,550
so that's a feature of the

1280
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:08,720
double-stranded evening that's a really

1281
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,490
good question though and and that's

1282
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,379
something I wish I had more time to

1283
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:14,629
study I would definitely look further

1284
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,559
into those direct interactions that are

1285
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,150
going on they're really kind of

1286
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,790
understand that morphology a little bit

1287
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:21,200
more specifically with respect to the

1288
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:23,659
proteins I believe that those are

1289
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:43,689
unfolding to some extent once they bind

1290
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:43,690
to those our proteins are made do that

1291
00:50:44,289 --> 00:50:48,829
that's a really good question I wish I

1292
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,510
had a more definitive answer I mean

1293
00:50:48,829 --> 00:51:10,190
based on a circular dichroism I have no

1294
00:50:50,510 --> 00:51:14,829
reason to believe it definitely so BSA

1295
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:16,039
is cheap cowboyed it's a byproduct of

1296
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:19,730
slaughterhouses

1297
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,409
and these studies use a lot of protein

1298
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:23,510
so I wanted to use something like lah

1299
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:24,409
case or something initially but in order

1300
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,640
to kind of you get the kind of

1301
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:27,469
quantities I would need to run these

1302
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:29,629
studies with kind of purity I would need

1303
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:34,629
for a molecular level experiment it

1304
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:34,630
became cost prohibitive very fast but

1305
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:40,009
said there's a whole range of soil

1306
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,900
proteins in terms of their

1307
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,839
characteristics that includes sizes and

1308
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:48,048
charge characteristics so I think

1309
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:50,269
calling any single one a really great

1310
00:51:48,048 --> 00:51:52,519
model I think is unless I'm looking at a

1311
00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:54,380
specific process I think it's a little

1312
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:55,579
bit short-sighted here so I just want to

1313
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,298
go with something that's real broad

1314
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,298
quick and dirty

1315
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,679
yeah reviewers when I submit this paper

1316
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:05,450
to the yes and T they were the reviewers

1317
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:20,659
had a very similar set of concerns and I

1318
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:22,189
understand that fully is a fairly common

1319
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:23,659
physical chemical model I think for the

1320
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:27,530
reasons I explained that it's really

1321
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:29,538
cheap it's rarely available I always

1322
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:32,690
joke with people that ask me I say it's

1323
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:36,280
relevant under a dead cow like how is

1324
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,280
good diets can release the serum protein

1325
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:48,380
yeah I think a lot of people use it for

1326
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:50,358
very similar reasons and it's so well

1327
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,160
studied so I didn't have to for example

1328
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:54,469
the secondary structure I didn't have to

1329
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,699
go through a rigorous crystallography

1330
00:52:54,469 --> 00:52:57,649
experiment to get that that's already

1331
00:52:55,699 --> 00:53:28,608
been really well studied so I was able

1332
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:36,588
to verify my FTIR results with that yeah

1333
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:38,719
so it was passive and kind of

1334
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:41,179
equilibrium German how much is needed is

1335
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:45,399
like actively attributed by biological

1336
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:45,399
processes include by microbes Avellino

1337
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:54,179
molecule kind of working it off

1338
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:57,179
yeah so the accessibility particularly

1339
00:53:54,179 --> 00:54:01,079
with respect to DNA is a topic of vast

1340
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:03,028
research interest and it's commonly kind

1341
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,669
of understood that mineral surface is to

1342
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:08,789
an extent kind of protect DNA in a lot

1343
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:12,900
of ways from from from microbial

1344
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:14,549
alteration as for the influence of the

1345
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,619
processes themselves on the presence of

1346
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:22,829
microbes that's a very good question I

1347
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:24,390
think once the microbes are there and

1348
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:26,039
they're exuding these kind of compounds

1349
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:30,298
that kind of opens up the door for them

1350
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:32,669
being a little more relevant but I think

1351
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:35,068
the general paradigm right now is that

1352
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:39,989
once molecules are adsorbed on services

1353
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:41,009
or some degree of protection there yeah

1354
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:44,668
I guess I probably didn't answer your

1355
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:46,380
question thoroughly but they do they do

1356
00:54:44,668 --> 00:54:47,548
so microbes so probably one them they

1357
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,390
would love to get their hands on but

1358
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:53,608
they're they're bound these mechanisms I

1359
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:57,118
think you know direct bond formation and

1360
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:59,038
you get actual unfolding which increases

1361
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,630
contact points between the biomolecule

1362
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,729
and mineral surface I think it just

1363
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,068
makes a lot of it really inaccessible as

1364
00:55:02,728 --> 00:55:08,098
you know energetically it's tough to get

1365
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:09,268
those off for the same reasons they love

1366
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:11,489
to get on there they're tough to get

1367
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:44,368
back off yeah there's just these vast

1368
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:45,719
releases of Gibbs free energy Oh in the

1369
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:59,579
literature roasting on that and this

1370
00:55:45,719 --> 00:56:01,099
makes a lot of sense so I think if we

1371
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:04,519
give

1372
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:05,838
I'll answer your question first I think

1373
00:56:04,518 --> 00:56:07,338
super Molecular Association would not

1374
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:08,509
occur when we get further and further

1375
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:11,328
and further away from the isoelectric

1376
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:12,769
point then the molecules become more

1377
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:15,229
electrostatically repulsive to each

1378
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:18,558
other so they're gonna wanna you know

1379
00:56:15,228 --> 00:56:20,478
they're less likely to get close that'd

1380
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,880
be one situation and situations of high

1381
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:25,159
ionic strength as well things tended

1382
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,548
dispersed and unincluded biomolecules so

1383
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:31,428
the local charges that could form that

1384
00:56:28,548 --> 00:56:33,798
could be an attractive force might be

1385
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:35,509
disrupted by the presence of more

1386
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:38,869
cations in solution they can disrupt

1387
00:56:35,509 --> 00:56:45,079
those things soured those are some of

1388
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:46,249
the situation's I'm thinking of it would

1389
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:49,059
also depend on the identity the

1390
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:49,058
biomolecule

1391
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:58,009
in almost there's a real good clean

1392
00:56:56,418 --> 00:57:00,949
answer I would depend a lot on the

1393
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:03,918
identity of cations on the identity of

1394
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:09,528
the biomolecules themselves with super

1395
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:10,938
molecular components within that as far

1396
00:57:09,528 --> 00:57:12,259
as the surface behavior is concerned

1397
00:57:10,938 --> 00:57:15,168
let's say we were to use calcium and the

1398
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:18,849
DNA study instead I think we probably

1399
00:57:15,168 --> 00:57:23,179
see a higher affinity for the surface

1400
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:25,309
well know for DNA specifically because

1401
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:26,959
again the electrostatically

1402
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:29,359
DNA doesn't really want to go near each

1403
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:30,649
other so that's kind of one of the

1404
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,509
limiting factors of adsorption on

1405
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,249
surfaces we would do something like add

1406
00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:36,048
calcium to the system you can kind of

1407
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:38,568
stabilize some of those negative charges

1408
00:57:36,048 --> 00:57:41,028
that are on the DNA backbone and there

1409
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:42,949
have been studies of come out of group

1410
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:44,929
in China that have shown that in the

1411
00:57:42,949 --> 00:57:47,119
presence of things something like I can

1412
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:56,209
easy on work calcium tends to enhance

1413
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:59,979
the absorption especially with clay

1414
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:59,978
minerals it could be a different story

1415
