1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,880
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:07,709
University alright so today I'm going to

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,019
talk about my efforts to characterize

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,780
early like tolerance within cultivated

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,849
tomato early blight is caused by

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,160
Alternaria tomato Phila or Alternaria

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,160
Salani it's an echo trophic fungal

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,420
pathogen within the city of my seats

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,189
this disease is widespread one plant

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,109
pathologist described it as present

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,730
wherever tomatoes are grown now that may

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,890
or may not be true but it certainly is a

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,219
problem in him in the humid and

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,109
semi-arid environments resistance to

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,750
this disease is quantitatively inherited

16
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,988
and the reckon isms underlying that

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,250
resistance remain poorly understood but

18
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:46,169
that doesn't mean that there isn't

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,210
substantial resistance within cultivated

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,489
tomato in fact while there is no single

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,439
gene resistance that provides full

22
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,339
resistance there is quite a bit of

23
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,149
resistance that's already been

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,100
integrated in the cultivated germ plasm

25
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,160
and while some mapping studies have

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,709
mapped QTL associated with tolerance or

27
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,358
partial resistance to early blight they

28
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,270
generally have had to do or the

29
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:11,339
generally opinion crosses with unadapted

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,959
while species germplasm and they haven't

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,469
really advanced into the breeding

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,909
programs past that wide cross stage and

33
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:20,428
so as a result we don't really have any

34
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,618
markers that are predictive for use in

35
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:24,329
everyday breeding and so that's the goal

36
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,649
for this project that's been my

37
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:28,379
objective for the last year and a half

38
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:32,539
or so is to develop some PCR markers

39
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:35,699
that are predictive of the major QTL

40
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:41,269
providing resistance to early blight and

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,319
then test them in several populations so

42
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:46,019
what's interesting about the early

43
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,299
blight disease of tomato is that the

44
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,578
resistance to it seems to be somewhat

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,799
tissue specific so we have different

46
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:55,288
responses in the foliage and in the

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,509
stems so I'm gonna break this down

48
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:59,668
during the course of my discussion today

49
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,918
in terms of the foliar and stem

50
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:06,899
tolerance so starting with this several

51
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:09,299
years ago Martha began breeding for

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,280
northeast adopted fresh market tomato

53
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:13,319
lines that were resistant to early

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,009
blight and also resistant to septoria

55
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,548
leaf

56
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:20,158
and lately she integrated in particular

57
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:22,349
resistance in the stems but also found

58
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:24,000
that that resistance conferred some

59
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:27,658
foliar tolerance as well under a lower

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,878
spray regime but the most market

61
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:31,939
differences in the stems themselves so

62
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:35,030
on the top here we have the resistance

63
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:38,128
genotype this is our resistant control

64
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,780
as you can see there are lesions that

65
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:41,699
are present but they don't tend to

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,590
elongate along the length of the stem

67
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,298
like they do in a susceptible material

68
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,239
and that's important because if you have

69
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,549
a if this lesion elongates and hits a

70
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,000
leaf axle the whole leaf tends to die

71
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:56,670
and in the same case with the fruits you

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,769
actually provide some fruit resistance

73
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:01,348
by having this form of tolerance because

74
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,730
the pathogen tends to sort of enter the

75
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,560
fruit through the top through the stem

76
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,378
end you actually see here in this upper

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,199
right hand corner either the the fruit

78
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:15,000
is sort of rotting from the stem end out

79
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:17,578
it's kind of interesting so in order to

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,989
map the resistance to this in order to

81
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,969
map that stem resistance in particular

82
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,889
and also to look at the Foley resistance

83
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:23,939
I worked with three parents and I'm

84
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,519
going to be talking about these

85
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,699
throughout the course of this discussion

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,469
our first one is 1510 95 - 146 that's a

87
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,209
Cornell triple resistant line late

88
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:35,900
blight early blight septoria leaf spot

89
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,128
it's the same one that's pictured here

90
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,250
we also have two Ohio

91
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:44,818
processing tomato lines Ohio 76063 and

92
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,150
Ohio 75-36 they come from David

93
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:50,638
Francis's breeding program at Ohio State

94
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,370
Ohio 75-36 for all intents and purposes

95
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,989
is considered our fully susceptible

96
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,609
control and Ohio 76063

97
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,230
actually has some form of foliar

98
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,000
tolerance I should note though that

99
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,709
neither of them are really truly fully

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,628
susceptible because they were from a

101
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,400
breeding program that's applied and it's

102
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:08,219
in a humid environment so like a lot of

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,229
reading material that's meant to become

104
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:15,150
a cultivar it's never fully susceptible

105
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:16,979
and so in order to do this is mapping

106
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,899
population or in order to do this

107
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,029
mapping I find it out to mapping

108
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:26,218
populations in the fall of or in the

109
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:27,939
summer of 2017 an f2 cross between 1510

110
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:29,980
95 - 146

111
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,360
and seven six six three and a triple

112
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,050
cross that involves all three of these

113
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,660
parents I inoculated him with a backpack

114
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,250
sprayer full of Alternaria North

115
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,800
Carolina number ten is altering its

116
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,019
bottle filler and I did separate

117
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,030
phenotyping for stem and foliar traits

118
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:48,669
the stem is on the one to five scale and

119
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:51,219
foliar is on a lunch or on a zero to 100

120
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,350
continuous scale and then I also

121
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,940
measured several importance or what I

122
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,810
thought would be important coat variants

123
00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:01,719
such as fruit size fruit sets fruit

124
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,310
counts and the plant architecture in

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,200
general when you look through the

126
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,240
literature you see that as the fruit

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,310
size goes up and it's a number of fruit

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,500
go up and the internal length goes down

129
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,899
you become more susceptible to early

130
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:19,120
blight then from this these populations

131
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,729
eye genotypes about half of the f2

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,769
population and about a third of the

133
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,930
triple cross population I started with

134
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:27,639
GPS markers but about a year later it

135
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,230
became apparent that we needed some

136
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,939
where we were missing some genotypes in

137
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,620
some key areas and so we threw some

138
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:38,110
snips data using the stochastic upset

139
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:42,730
and so I was able to map resistances to

140
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:48,639
this stem phase of this disease on 1 4 &amp;

141
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:52,360
9 the minor effect QTL are somewhere in

142
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,490
the range of 6 to 7 6 to 8 percent real

143
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,100
killer is this guy up here this is

144
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,050
chromosome 9 QTL explains about 1/3 of

145
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,010
the variation for the century that's

146
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:06,780
major effect locus for the foliar form

147
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:10,659
of the disease we've got hits on 1 5 8 9

148
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:14,109
they're all about between 5 and 12

149
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,280
percent they're on the lower end but

150
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,199
that's consistent with the literature

151
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,369
and consistent with what we see in terms

152
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,649
of distributions there are also

153
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,590
significant interactions between the QTL

154
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:28,120
and between these QTL and other regions

155
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:30,759
in the genome but for the purposes of

156
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,680
keeping this discussion short slice I'm

157
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,069
only going to be focusing on 3 QTL

158
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,668
that's on 1 5 &amp; 9 these are our biggest

159
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,920
effect additive loci and I want you to

160
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:50,529
note also that the QTL chromosome

161
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:52,480
at 9:00 also pop up for this disease so

162
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:56,589
to confirm the QTL effects we did a few

163
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,360
things to start with I looked at the

164
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,549
genotypes for the f2 individuals that

165
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,730
were used for mapping astray and I

166
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,460
selected based on these QTL regions for

167
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,040
f2 individuals that were homozygous for

168
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:11,259
all three of the QTL regions in all

169
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,680
possible combinations were possible so

170
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:18,069
a1 in this case is C 0 7 more six allele

171
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,699
I'm sorry see you 15 295 - 146 allele

172
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,719
and the 3 is the Ohio a 7-6 6-3 Leo and

173
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,839
I'm going to be using this coding

174
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,330
throughout as well and I planted the the

175
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,799
f2 3 families so the progeny will be

176
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:32,529
selected at two individuals in a

177
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,720
replicated trial this year into Williger

178
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,909
and I sprayed them again with alternate

179
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,610
amount of filler so we did mapping we

180
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:43,030
did phenotyping for the stem and for

181
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,129
your trades and to start with if we just

182
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:48,579
look at the distribution of the stem

183
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:53,259
phenotype about the marker scores so the

184
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:55,629
genotypes here again are 1 2 &amp; 3 we see

185
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,500
that there is a significant difference

186
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:03,370
for the phenotype between the markers

187
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,439
and actually when we did that additional

188
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,389
genotyping using the silk a subset the

189
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,550
locations for the QTL shifted a little

190
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,979
bit and so here are the updated QTL

191
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,629
locations I told you that I select for

192
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,890
homozygosity at the QTL but

193
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,659
unfortunately won't change those

194
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,639
positions we introduced some header as I

195
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,830
entered some headers I got to me at the

196
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,240
QTL locations but actually the fit on

197
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:26,769
chromosome 1 is significantly better but

198
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,769
what may be more convincing is if we

199
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:31,870
just rank the f2 3 families by their

200
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:34,929
phenotype so in this case we've got the

201
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,090
stem infection we've got families f2 3

202
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,309
families on rows and as you move down

203
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,590
the table you have increasing disease in

204
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,599
the stems the two key multiple

205
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,320
comparison is used to differentiate the

206
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,149
families statistically and this coding

207
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,290
I've used here is a single plus

208
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,360
indicates

209
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:55,389
homozygous for the resistant form of the

210
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,639
allele plus minus indicates heterozygous

211
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,980
- indicates homozygous for the

212
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,169
successful and these are the three loci

213
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,440
or QTL on chromosomes one five and nine

214
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:07,240
and importantly what we see is on

215
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
chromosome nine that major effect low

216
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,460
focus is perfectly associated with the

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,919
trait so that's definitely encouraging

218
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,410
we do the same thing for fullier ranking

219
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,240
again from most resistant to most

220
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:26,289
susceptible and you again see that the

221
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,409
distribution of resistant alleles tends

222
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:31,990
to be associated with plants that are

223
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:34,839
resistant in fact and again for the

224
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,990
markers chromosomes one five and nine

225
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,149
QTL we do see significant differences in

226
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,210
phenotype as a function of the markers

227
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:46,860
course looking at this a different way

228
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:53,200
and using a different population i

229
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:56,019
generated generated alright i generated

230
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,450
a back cross one individual and so this

231
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,220
is back cross to the recurrent parent

232
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,200
and we use background genome selection

233
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,800
to clean up this material as much as

234
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,410
possible

235
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,779
so actually we select in selecting we

236
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:11,350
were able to eliminate all but three

237
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:13,329
chromosomes from play essentially so the

238
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,580
remainder of the genome is fixed

239
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,530
homozygous for this cornell recurrent

240
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,840
parent genome and of those three

241
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,309
chromosomes that are so segregating two

242
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,899
of them are chromosome five in

243
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:27,519
chromosome nine which are where our

244
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:29,319
cutie li or two of our cutie li so we

245
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,970
put a segregating population out which

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,629
is a self progeny of that bc one

247
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:38,290
individual and for the stem trait again

248
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:42,730
we see a nice separation here where as

249
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:46,689
you move from the Cornell genotype to

250
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:51,370
the Ohio genotype your you become more

251
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,140
susceptible to the disease and again for

252
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,129
the foliar we looked at the chromosome

253
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:59,620
five in chromosome nine QTL again

254
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:03,370
statistically significant separation and

255
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,450
then finally we had before the the last

256
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,879
thing that hasn't been yet confirmed

257
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,040
this chromosome one locus we chose and

258
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,049
have two population

259
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:16,838
excuse me an f2 individual from this

260
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:20,078
cross this Ohio 7-6 6-3 by 1510 95 146

261
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,750
and crossed it back to a different Ohio

262
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:25,000
parents this f2 happened to be fixed for

263
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,708
chromosomes 5 and 9 and so we're

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,559
actually amplifying artificially the

265
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:35,799
effect of the chromosome 1 locus and we

266
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:37,508
do see effect so I think I hope that

267
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,120
I've conveyed that there's statistically

268
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:42,639
significant results for these 3 QTL but

269
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,690
what about visual our practicals because

270
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,549
we want to use this in the breeding

271
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,190
program and if we're going to say a line

272
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,958
is resistant if a farmer or a grower

273
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,810
receive this material their claims to be

274
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,388
resistant and it's not we're in we're in

275
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:58,119
trouble so for that I'm going to take

276
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,100
you on a virtual journey back to free

277
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,769
ville New York in the summer of 2018 on

278
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,269
a sunny day in August and we're gonna

279
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:09,039
walk through the replicated trial so if

280
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,470
we start with in with a plot enough to

281
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,480
three family that has zero of the QTL

282
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,009
it's fully susceptible as you can see

283
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,750
the plants are not happy there's no

284
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:19,838
foliage left the stems are all infected

285
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:24,190
dead total loss we add in a chromosome

286
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,740
one QTL we get some retainment of

287
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:29,110
foliage but in general all the plants

288
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,019
still look pretty awful same thing with

289
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,039
the chromosome 5 locus chromosome 5 QTL

290
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:38,560
on its own we add in the chromosome 9

291
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:43,568
QTL on its own again this looks pretty

292
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:45,939
awful but if we zoom in on the stems so

293
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:50,679
as expected it provided a lot of stem

294
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,910
tolerance but not if we start adding QTL

295
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,188
together though then we start getting

296
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:57,938
measurable results or practically wizard

297
00:12:54,188 --> 00:13:01,539
select practically different results we

298
00:12:57,938 --> 00:13:03,578
see enhancement in the ability to keep

299
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:05,318
the foliage but in this case we don't

300
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:09,039
have that chromosome 9 locus and so the

301
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:11,049
stems are still dirty still infected if

302
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,809
we CRO add in the chromosome 5 and

303
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,309
chromosome 9 together you get about the

304
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,838
same level of foliar tolerance but you

305
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:19,028
can actually see there are fewer of the

306
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,130
fruit that are rotting prematurely on on

307
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:22,600
the black plastic here you can see that

308
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:25,899
in terms of these

309
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,460
these orange and red fruits they tend

310
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:29,709
actually at this early stage in the

311
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,629
season if you see that it's usually

312
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,920
because the infection is actually

313
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:36,519
separated the fruit from the plant and

314
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,929
so it's right things with one stone and

315
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,069
when you add all three of the kids yell

316
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,509
together you get a plant that looks

317
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,990
pretty darn good compared to that

318
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:48,009
initial susceptible plant that was

319
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:50,649
completely dead and so you and also I

320
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:53,200
want to point out that I inoculated this

321
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:57,009
for the backpacks for my material of the

322
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,770
pathogen I sprayed it with overhead

323
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:02,889
irrigation and I proved up so to

324
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:05,350
basically enhance the disease and I

325
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:07,360
didn't provide any chemical control

326
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,580
whatsoever because I wanted this disease

327
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,289
to spread like wildfire so if this plant

328
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,750
is doing as well or if this plot is

329
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,429
doing as well giving those conditions

330
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,779
you can imagine that in a low to

331
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,639
moderate spray regime in a farmer's

332
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:23,829
field you could actually be doing pretty

333
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,830
well and so with that just talk briefly

334
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:31,060
about next steps for this project

335
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:33,040
so um I've I've looked at the effects of

336
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,719
the QTL but I haven't totally controlled

337
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,179
for all the background effects yet and

338
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,370
so for that we really need to generate

339
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,299
some nitrogen declines that are in the

340
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,679
background ideally of both the Ohio and

341
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:48,729
Cornell material and test the QTL

342
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:51,789
effects on their own and so we're in the

343
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,620
process of doing that I'm also going to

344
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:55,929
be doing some selective phenotyping so

345
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,549
I'm going to put a plant out a thousand

346
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,769
or more individuals we're going to use

347
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,449
genotyping to identify some individuals

348
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,069
that have few school accomodates and I'm

349
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:08,920
going to phenotype using a greenhouse

350
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:10,870
screen you actually see up here and we

351
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,479
also received some sequence data from

352
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,919
the two parents and so I'm going to be

353
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,050
going through and looking at the

354
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,819
sequences in the QTL locations to try

355
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:23,229
and identify some candidate genes and

356
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,910
I'll be adding in some digital

357
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,639
phenotyping work to try and enhance this

358
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:33,069
I've actually begun using this tool

359
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:35,110
called phenom from my course lab and

360
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,560
hopefully I'll get you analyzing that in

361
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,389
the next

362
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,638
police and then finally we're going to

363
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,870
be creating products with this we want

364
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,810
to be able to use these markers to

365
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,519
generate material that's resistant to

366
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,099
early light late like Victoria and

367
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,778
bacterial spanking bacterial spot the

368
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,459
bacterial side of the project is another

369
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:56,889
part of reading that I'll be talking

370
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:59,109
about next year and so with that I'd

371
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:03,568
like to thank I laughs I'd like to thank

372
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:06,009
David Francis his breeding program for

373
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:10,149
providing some of the material and some

374
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:12,039
support and my graduate committee and

375
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,230
I'd like to thank my funding sources

376
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:41,909
including Michael was very cool neta for

377
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:45,068
his class any questions give any

378
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:49,269
explanation for why that was yeah

379
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:51,219
so remember I told you I planted out a

380
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:53,860
triple cross population so that was

381
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,720
supposed to be a BC one back to the Ohio

382
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,839
parent and that's what this is supposed

383
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,250
to be it turns out the cidade was not

384
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,410
what we thought it was it was actually

385
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,328
an f2 selection and so a lot of the Gino

386
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:05,529
is already fixed so that's why I don't

387
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:10,058
show an effect plot here because it's

388
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:11,168
artificially escalated because we a lot

389
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:13,449
of the genome was fixed we're not

390
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,759
accounting for that and then and then I

391
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,130
guess the second was it was nice to see

392
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,490
all of the stacked genes in fact they

393
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:25,299
have is it completely additive or do you

394
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:33,429
argue see but there's stasis I do see

395
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:35,950
epistasis between the Louis I I am well

396
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:40,960
I have a few thoughts and I have some

397
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:43,538
concerns as well so the as I said

398
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,710
earlier the early blade trade seems to

399
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:47,710
be associated with several prime

400
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,360
architecture traits and so I want to be

401
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,610
sure that what I'm mapping is

402
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,928
just a changing internode length and so

403
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,859
if it's a change in internet length you

404
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,290
can imagine that there would be

405
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:58,089
interaction potentially like if it was

406
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,289
on chromosome 1 you would expect to see

407
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,839
an interaction between the internet

408
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,670
length and chromosome 9 stem tolerance

409
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,169
QTL and in fact you too and they're

410
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,220
actually pairwise interactions between

411
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,679
all three of the QTL so I'm I have begun

412
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,400
digging into that but I haven't fully

413
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,920
fleshed it out yet so I really I really

414
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,960
need immortal populations or Nils to

415
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:26,289
test this properly which is what I'm

416
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:28,690
doing now and Kevin with your plots we

417
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:31,569
get all three or the QTL stacked up

418
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,700
uh-huh it did look great but they also

419
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:37,599
looked like the fruit was later in

420
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,730
ripening yeah so that is another

421
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,079
association that you see with early bite

422
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,460
resistance and I'm not sure if this is

423
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,189
due to the early blight resistance or

424
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,910
due to the fact that the fruit part

425
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,820
separating from the plant

426
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,679
so as the infection sort of gets through

427
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:55,869
the peduncle it separates the fruit and

428
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,059
then the fruit ripens prematurely and so

429
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:00,789
in those super susceptible material

430
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:03,759
you'll see a lotta a lot of ripe fruit

431
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,319
right but it's not actually right in

432
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,779
general the seeds wouldn't be viable and

433
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:11,079
when you touch it the fruits not it's

434
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:13,440
not actually there it's not physiology B

435
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:17,109
right it's just it's just French so

436
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,940
again in order to test this properly we

437
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:22,740
need we need more populations because I

438
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,740
need to be able to plant this out in a

439
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:50,950
my so my limited understanding of that

440
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:55,109
is that it it does not frequently if at

441
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,009
all you produce sexually in the wild I

442
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:01,918
can't answer your question about

443
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:03,069
lineages necessarily there are two

444
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,450
speech

445
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,279
of this alternate smart fella and

446
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,630
Alternaria Salani ten years ago they

447
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,139
were the same species but they've now

448
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:15,310
been separated based on I guess someone

449
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:18,009
host host specificity or Salani is

450
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:22,839
primarily a potato host and tomato

451
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:27,009
fellows primarily to meet almost any

452
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:29,559
other questions so I guess thank you

453
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:32,619
that was invasion as well I want to do

454
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:35,649
like you know guys this has been a

455
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:39,689
production of Cornell University on the

456
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,690
web at Cornell edu
