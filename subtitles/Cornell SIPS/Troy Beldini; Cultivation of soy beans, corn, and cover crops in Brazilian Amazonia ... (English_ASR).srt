1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,849
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,638
okay great thanks so it's great to be

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,208
here today

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,699
once again I'm Troy building professors

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:25,528
visiting associate professor in Matt's

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:28,799
laboratory from Brazil okay so today I'm

8
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,480
going to talk about here my topics and

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,079
objectives I'm going to talk about a

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,310
little bit about agriculture in Brazil

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,679
and also in the Amazon I'm going to get

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,770
into a little bit about cover crops the

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,500
actual situation right now and then the

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,160
need for cover crops in agricultural

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,469
systems in the Amazon

16
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,269
I'll talk about approve an analysis of

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:56,689
pyramidal and meta-analysis rather that

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,340
I did just finished the first draft on

19
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:01,369
the use of pearl millet in the

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,800
agricultural systems in the Amazon then

21
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:07,099
I'll get into some present in future

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,799
work in Brazil that that we're doing

23
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:14,228
then we'll have the closing comments

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:18,530
so probably as many of you know

25
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:25,930
Brazil's an agricultural leader in the

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:28,728
world they the country was a net

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,520
importer of food grains in the 70s and

28
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:33,228
it was considered to be sort of backward

29
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,978
in terms of Agriculture whereas now

30
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:40,489
today it's a powerhouse agribusiness I

31
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:45,950
think in 2017 was responsible for around

32
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:49,280
40% of exports and maybe a third of GDP

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,250
and every year a large percentage of

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,539
growth in GDP comes from agribusiness in

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,179
Brazil if we look at this figure here we

36
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,368
can see that for a lot of the

37
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:03,530
commodities the rank and world

38
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:07,519
production value increased during the

39
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:11,060
period from 1970 to 2017 increased quite

40
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:14,780
a bit especially for chicken for meat

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,430
from cattle soybeans Brazil is one of

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,259
the world largest exporters and all

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,810
these products probably the larger

44
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:23,870
producer and exporter of oranges coffee

45
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,120
so it is a world leader production and

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,819
total factor productivity has more than

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,009
doubled during this period and part of

48
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:35,629
that is due to the increase in area of

49
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:39,318
especially soybeans during the period

50
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:42,560
from 1970 to 2017 area of soybeans

51
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,799
increased 70% and corn increased by 30

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
percent

53
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:54,159
Brazil is also a world leader in no-till

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:59,830
agriculture we can see here that here we

55
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:02,919
go the area under no-till in 2007-2008

56
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:07,480
was about 25 to 1/2 million hectares

57
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:09,458
it's about 65 million acres and there

58
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:14,379
was a 20% increase during about the last

59
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:19,330
10 years and today they have about 81

60
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:21,759
million acres under no-till about 70% of

61
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,640
all cultivated land in Brazil is under

62
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,530
no-till agriculture so that's really

63
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,259
something that Brazilian farmers are

64
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,360
sold on they really believe that no-till

65
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:36,848
is one of the foundations to make

66
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:40,239
agriculture sustainable so now I want to

67
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:45,189
explain a little bit about how things

68
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:48,310
have changed in recent years the first

69
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:52,419
of all the savanna or saddle in

70
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,340
Portuguese biome or ecosystem is where a

71
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,780
lot of this increase in agriculture has

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,750
occurred in Brazil and still is

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,818
increasing it's a huge area larger than

74
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,949
California and Alaska combined we can

75
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:05,469
see the image here that's in green

76
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,929
that's the saddle a half of it is de

77
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:10,599
forested and there was a large increase

78
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,980
in agricultural land use between 2000

79
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:18,819
and 2014 so so what has happened is that

80
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:20,769
farmers have basically migrated from the

81
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:24,849
south of Brazil up through the cerrado

82
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:27,490
and now during the last 10 maybe 15

83
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,939
years farmers have migrated into the

84
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,728
Amazon to where I'm located and that's

85
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:38,050
considered to be one of the agricultural

86
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:40,300
frontiers in Brazil today so capitalized

87
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,189
farmers are making this migration today

88
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,780
due to there's a lot of factors involved

89
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,959
but basically it has to do with cheaper

90
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,959
land

91
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,939
so the geographic area of the focus of

92
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,810
my talk of a lot of things I'm going to

93
00:04:52,939 --> 00:05:00,649
talk about today is Western para so if

94
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:05,569
we look here this is the legal Amazon

95
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:09,019
okay and then the state of Para is here

96
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:12,170
I'm located right about here in this

97
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:14,439
region that's the top of Joyce River at

98
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:19,970
the confluence of the Amazon River and

99
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:21,769
then these areas in red show basically

100
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,770
the region that I'm referring to you as

101
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:31,279
Western pada which is more or less this

102
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:34,569
region here okay so what's the most

103
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,039
important on a large scale at least

104
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:40,959
agricultural activity in this region of

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,660
the Amazon its soybeans followed by corn

106
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:50,629
okay what happens is that soybeans are

107
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:52,550
planted sometime usually around the end

108
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,560
of December beginning of January it

109
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,910
depends on the year the climate and then

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,319
they're harvested sometime around the

111
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,150
end of April mid May something like that

112
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,560
after the harvest corn is planted it's

113
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:06,620
called the second crop corn

114
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,250
Selenia in portuguese and this allows

115
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,050
farmers to to harvest two crops on the

116
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,560
same piece of land during one season

117
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,300
okay so that's planted immediately after

118
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,829
the soybeans are harvested so if the

119
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,800
soybeans are harvested at the beginning

120
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:24,199
of May just a couple days after so the

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,540
corn is planted and then it's harvested

122
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,599
sometime around the end of August the

123
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,379
beginning of September okay so farmers

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,379
can get to crops

125
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,060
so then looking at these dates you know

126
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,610
these periods of time these months the

127
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,120
question is what about August September

128
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,800
through December January what about that

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,750
more or less four months period what

130
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,000
happens then and that's what I'm gonna

131
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,199
talk about a little bit today here I

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,038
wanted to put into context the

133
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,009
importance of agriculture to the economy

134
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:03,288
in this region of the Amazon we can see

135
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,300
here some statistics on the production

136
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:08,930
chain of soybeans and corn in this

137
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:13,910
region this industry is responsible for

138
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:16,728
about 5,000 direct indirect jobs there

139
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,680
are about 240,000 acres of soybeans and

140
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:22,490
corn planted every year in the region

141
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,098
and that's responsible for about sixty

142
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,120
million dollars each year in financial

143
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:31,158
transactions so this puts into context

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:37,550
the magnitude of what's going on in this

145
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:41,029
agriculture land use change here's some

146
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,460
figures from PhD student with whom I

147
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:45,500
worked we can see here as a dynamics of

148
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,908
land-use change in the region we've got

149
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,329
three of the most important

150
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:53,449
municipalities in the region mazui Delta

151
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:57,370
and synthetic and the land-use change

152
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:59,629
from 2001 to 2014 and as you'll see

153
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,538
land-use change the direction of things

154
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:05,839
is very different in each place for

155
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:08,089
example 61% during the period 61 percent

156
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:12,319
of land use change was forest and

157
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:16,369
pasture to agriculture in mazui here in

158
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:20,259
Belle Terre 90% or more was forced in

159
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,569
agriculture going to pasture and then in

160
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:26,658
santorini 84 percent was forest that got

161
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,430
converted to agriculture and pasture so

162
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:32,750
I think one of the reasons for this is

163
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:34,729
it has to do with prices for commodities

164
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,250
on international national and

165
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,270
international markets and farmers have

166
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:44,028
the flexibility to year-to-year they can

167
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,079
turn a pasture into a soy field or vice

168
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,850
versa

169
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,790
a lot of times what will happen is if

170
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,790
soit prices go up a farmer will rent out

171
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:55,279
his land for two or three years to a

172
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:56,929
neighboring farmer that has the capacity

173
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,299
the equipment and knowledge and

174
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:02,539
everything to grow soybeans so that's an

175
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:04,279
interesting dynamic in the region so

176
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:06,829
let's get into a little bit about cover

177
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,179
crops here now one of the things that's

178
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,920
been going on in the last few years

179
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:15,859
there is interceding of Congo grass as a

180
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,529
cover crop mulch for no-till planting so

181
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,460
here we've got images from December of

182
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:26,149
this year of 2018 sorry showing the

183
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,610
dried Congo grass just before soybean

184
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,889
planting and what happens is that this

185
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,480
grass is interceded it's it's either

186
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:38,059
interceded within the Rose soybean just

187
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,610
a few weeks before harvest or it's

188
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,189
interceded into the second crop corn

189
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,550
when the corn gets to be maybe about 15

190
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:49,010
centimeters or so the advantages of the

191
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:52,189
congo grass are that it has a rapid

192
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,379
establishment that it has a high

193
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,160
sensitivity to desiccation which is

194
00:09:54,379 --> 00:10:01,159
really good for a no-till mulch and the

195
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,469
cattle can be grazed on it so after

196
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,360
harvesting a second crop corn you can

197
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,740
bring cattle in there the the harvesting

198
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,080
when you harvest the second crop corn

199
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,450
the grass will shoot right up the cattle

200
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,920
can come in graze on that and also on

201
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,890
the corn residuals some of the

202
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,719
disadvantages of the the use of Congo

203
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,139
grass are that it has a high

204
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,710
susceptibility to pests cigogne is the

205
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:26,750
name I think spittlebug here and has low

206
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:30,440
drought resistance and that's something

207
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,049
I'm going to talk about just in another

208
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,060
slide coming right up so here's an image

209
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:40,629
of no-till planting in January this year

210
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:42,979
that's the Congo grass mulch with the

211
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:45,259
soybean being planted in and then this

212
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,350
is about a month later you can see the

213
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:50,439
mulch on the ground here with soybeans

214
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,710
growing quite well and in the background

215
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,340
that's a

216
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,740
Castaneda that's a Brazil nut tree so

217
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,509
what you'll see down there is are these

218
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
huge fields that go out sometimes

219
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,500
through the horizon and they'll be

220
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,389
interspersed with these lone huge trees

221
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,309
sitting all by themselves Brazil nut

222
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,870
tree because you can't cut them down so

223
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:13,199
it's a kind of a neat thing to see it

224
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:16,590
makes for an interesting visual so here

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,629
we are with soybeans about two months

226
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,090
after planting the end of March of this

227
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,669
year growing quite well

228
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:27,660
very vigorous and and looking at the

229
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:30,089
this image here it makes you sort of

230
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,429
think that well the Congo grass really

231
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:36,030
serves as a cover crop it's doing its

232
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:38,789
job and that may be the case but the

233
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,870
thing is that these guys these farmers

234
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:45,509
these guys are planting this Congo grass

235
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:49,500
based on what happens in mato grosso in

236
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:53,279
in the sahara so it's sort of empirical

237
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,700
there's no experimental basis for this

238
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,120
just yet so that leads me naturally to

239
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,920
conclude that there are lots of unknowns

240
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,360
therefore a great need for

241
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:06,240
diversification of cover crops in the

242
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,110
region for example farms with little

243
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,620
farms with no cattle don't need to use

244
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:16,529
pasture grass as cover then the other

245
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,179
thing I thought about is does this Congo

246
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,539
grass as it really does it make

247
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:25,199
sufficient mulch biomass mulch for the

248
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:27,299
no-till crop what what are the effects

249
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,180
of it on cash crop yield does it

250
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,589
contribute to the yield of the cash crop

251
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:32,339
pest resistance potential for

252
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,060
intercropping

253
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:39,060
other uses such as seeds and can we use

254
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,609
this for as a seed bank and then what

255
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,929
about drought tolerance and and in our

256
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,330
region

257
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:48,479
that's a big deal and I'm gonna explain

258
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,610
that here now so climate and water

259
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
balance are going to be really important

260
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,769
in terms of decision making about what

261
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,080
cover crops we're gonna use you can see

262
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,669
here you've got an image of the

263
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,180
Brazilian Amazon with the köppen

264
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:04,919
classification coloured in this is from

265
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,519
a publication of colleagues of mine from

266
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,558
Umbra

267
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:13,709
here's pata and the arrow arrow points

268
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:16,889
to where I'm located so our region is a

269
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,688
mix of a m3 and a m4 so that means we

270
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,360
get a pretty strong dry season in this

271
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:23,308
region and we can see here looking at

272
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,360
the water balance figure that I made

273
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:30,480
here from 1990 to 2000 18 millimeters of

274
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,360
rainfall an average temperature here the

275
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,308
line is the average temperature so the

276
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,409
blue is a rainfall the green is the

277
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:41,909
excess and then the red is the deficit

278
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:44,278
that exists and if you look at the

279
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:47,068
figure you can see the deficit available

280
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,409
water deficit begins sometime around the

281
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:51,419
end of July it's really strong for a

282
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:53,969
couple of months and then begins to

283
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:57,808
diminish towards the end of December so

284
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,329
this period is a really important moment

285
00:13:57,808 --> 00:14:02,610
in terms of the agricultural year the

286
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:04,739
agricultural cycle and this is sort of

287
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,949
what I'm going to talk about in terms of

288
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,528
cover crops here there's another factor

289
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:14,399
here yeah that's really important to

290
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:18,350
take into account and besides our

291
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,360
natural seasonal variation we're having

292
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,689
problems with droughts in the region

293
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,720
we've had droughts 2005 15 10 and 15

294
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:29,548
pretty severe droughts that appear to

295
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,209
get longer and duration and more severe

296
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:37,828
so these figures from 2018 publication

297
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:40,528
here show monthly precipitation well let

298
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:43,888
me first explain here the dashed line is

299
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:47,730
the 16 year average from 2000 to 2016

300
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:50,339
the solid line is what happened in 2015

301
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,909
and 16 so we've got monthly

302
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:57,629
precipitation here by satellite and by

303
00:14:53,909 --> 00:15:00,778
rain gauges and both show a decrease of

304
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:05,399
16 17 percent in rainfall during the

305
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:08,129
period 2015-2016 and the gauges showed a

306
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,409
decrease of 16 percent compared to the

307
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:15,310
hundred and 15 year average so this is a

308
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:18,719
big deal actually during

309
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:21,909
December January February of 2015 16

310
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,160
pastors caught on fire roadsides were on

311
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:26,289
fire Forest caught fire cattle are

312
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
breaking down barbed wire fences to get

313
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:30,698
into greener pastures

314
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:35,709
so this is real we're seeing this down

315
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:38,318
there here we have temperature it was a

316
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:40,869
point seven degrees Celsius above the 16

317
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,769
year average vapor pressure deficit same

318
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:48,100
thing higher and then the maximum

319
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:51,308
climatological water deficit shows a

320
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,499
very large deficit that basically

321
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:55,629
continued all the way through this whole

322
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:59,709
period so in other words when the rains

323
00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:02,740
came finally there was still a large

324
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:05,438
deficit because it was the the deficit

325
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,159
was so strong in the previous months so

326
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:10,748
seeing this and thinking about this made

327
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,350
me think you know that this is this

328
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:15,819
shows that there's a great need for

329
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,180
incorporation of drought resistant cover

330
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:23,429
crops during the follow period between

331
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:28,029
cultivation of cash crops

332
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:29,379
here's an image of the drought with so

333
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,500
we can see this this demonstrates

334
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:34,059
clearly what happened the due to the

335
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,259
drought planting of soybeans were

336
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:41,409
delayed three months or so we can see

337
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:43,419
here at the end of May 2015 we were

338
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:46,539
doing a soil sampling on this day and

339
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:50,139
soybeans were harvested and then we can

340
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:53,319
see here about a year later May 12 2016

341
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:55,659
sly beans were basically just planted so

342
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,940
due to the drought everything got

343
00:16:55,659 --> 00:17:00,879
delayed and what ended up happening is

344
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,580
that the second crop corn wasn't planted

345
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,299
that year so what does that mean that

346
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,740
means that farmers lost out economically

347
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,509
they didn't plant they didn't harvest

348
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,930
not just that there's an opportunity

349
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:16,180
cost involved meaning that farmers left

350
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,589
fields bare during a dry season when

351
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,720
they could have gone in there and

352
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:21,429
planted some kind of cover crop that

353
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,380
would have enhanced soil fertility and

354
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,299
brought other benefits they didn't do it

355
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,980
because of the drought so everything

356
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,569
just laid bare so that's one of the

357
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,240
concrete effects that you can see right

358
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:38,730
here due to droughts in the region so

359
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,740
then the strong dry season and the

360
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,430
question of droughts requires the use of

361
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,589
a drought resistant cover crop and if we

362
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,750
look at the figure again a water balance

363
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:54,699
figure here millimeters of rainfall

364
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:57,579
temperature we've got a rainfall excess

365
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,460
and deficit here so soybeans are planted

366
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:04,539
somewhere around the end of December and

367
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:08,890
a normal year harvest occurs sometime in

368
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:10,420
April mid April so soon afterwards the

369
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,120
second crop is planted and then the

370
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:17,170
second crop is harvested sometime

371
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:20,469
generally in August ok and that gives us

372
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:23,410
this period here what I call the window

373
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,870
of opportunity when a drought resistant

374
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,840
cover crop could be introduced to

375
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:30,819
improve soil fertility and generate

376
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,309
mulch from no-till so I've got this

377
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,899
period here

378
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:38,299
and we have to also take into account

379
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:41,940
climate models climate models

380
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:44,069
demonstrate generally that droughts will

381
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,740
become more frequent rainfall will

382
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:49,559
become more intense during the wet

383
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,500
season and they'll be longer periods dry

384
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,289
periods with no rain so taking all this

385
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,109
as a whole thinking about it what might

386
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:01,879
be inadequate species of cover crop to

387
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:05,250
put in in this period here first of all

388
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,350
want to say that in the use of cover

389
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,279
crops in general across the Amazon is

390
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:11,459
sort of insipid

391
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:15,359
still um it hasn't really taken hold

392
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:18,450
just yet an example this is this map

393
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,209
from Kona B which is an agency that is

394
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,069
responsible for generating statistics

395
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,980
and data about agricultural production

396
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:29,279
in the country this is from July 18 and

397
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:34,079
it's for sorghum so we can see here in

398
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:37,379
the great majority of the Amazon region

399
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,990
there's nothing nothing for sorghum

400
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,820
the thing is though um I know for a fact

401
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,430
personally that there is sort of

402
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:46,799
implanting in the Amazon in our region

403
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,870
I've seen it know the farmers and I

404
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,619
talked to the president from the rural

405
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:54,809
syndicate in January and he said he

406
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,369
knows the farmers he knows the farms he

407
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,379
said yeah there's sorghum here there

408
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:00,509
might be a thousand hectares but there

409
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,260
saw them so on a macro scale you won't

410
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:09,480
see this I'm more local scale you'll

411
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:10,829
find the use of cover crops so then back

412
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,049
in the fall I started thinking about

413
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:15,509
what it is I wanted to do in terms of

414
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,980
writing and researching something and of

415
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:19,230
course I had an idea well you know I

416
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,150
look at about 50 species of cover crops

417
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,519
and write about them and their potential

418
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,070
for use in the Amazon and that became

419
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,269
became pretty evident very soon that I

420
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:29,220
couldn't do that

421
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,660
once I started to narrow down my focus

422
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,880
and really think about what it is I

423
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,440
wanted to say it became obvious that

424
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,620
even writing about maybe three or four

425
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,230
species would be tough but at any rate

426
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:43,678
some of the species I found here are

427
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,750
still Sciences they call it steel in

428
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,530
Brazil I think it might be called pencil

429
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:52,259
here wrote ilaria that's what they call

430
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:56,009
it there think about four species that

431
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:58,379
are used in Brazil sunhemp is what I've

432
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:01,049
seen their sorghum

433
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,720
Jack being a couple of different pasture

434
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,809
grasses and then pearl millet so

435
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,930
realizing that I could only use just one

436
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:13,859
species for this for this analysis I did

437
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:17,009
I opted to use pearl millet and the

438
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:19,979
title of the paper the first draft here

439
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:22,769
is the use of perilla as a cover crop

440
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,460
species in Amazonian agar ecosystems to

441
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:30,960
promote sustainable agriculture a

442
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:34,079
descriptive meta-analysis so then Y P

443
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,630
Glaucon basically because it appears to

444
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,929
have characteristics that make it

445
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:43,560
suitable for use in these systems down

446
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,710
Amazon and some of these characteristics

447
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,259
are that it's drought resistant

448
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,529
deep-rooted it's a c4 plant so they

449
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:55,019
adapted to tropical biomes systems it's

450
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:57,990
capable of a large biomass production

451
00:21:55,019 --> 00:22:01,079
which is important for no-till it's a

452
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,359
nutrient recycler it can be used as a

453
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:05,519
grain or forage crop seeds are

454
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,779
relatively cheap and easily available

455
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,420
and also because I personally know that

456
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:15,480
this is being used in the region in the

457
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,460
Amazon - I've seen it there there might

458
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,900
be a thousand hectares of it once again

459
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,900
maybe less so

460
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,798
what are the what are the aspects of

461
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:31,419
them that I decided to look at in terms

462
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:34,700
of the use of Perelman as a cover crop

463
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:37,059
well they're a bunch of them here I'm

464
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,620
gonna just focus on these four and bold

465
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:42,230
the potential for biomass generation

466
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:45,199
residue decomposition nutrient cycling

467
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,808
and the effect on the cash crop yield

468
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,009
and I also looked at some others soil C

469
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:54,859
inputs percentage of soil coverage and

470
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:58,480
weed control potential as a forage cache

471
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:00,979
or seek robbery and drug resistance so

472
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,140
the overarching question here is what

473
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,399
are the possible contributions to the

474
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:09,788
resilience and the sustainability in

475
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:12,589
Amazonian agro ecosystems okay and

476
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:15,500
you'll see that I call this a meta

477
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:17,869
analysis a descriptive meta analysis for

478
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,240
those of you who are familiar with meta

479
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:23,769
analyses you probably know that you have

480
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,859
to have a series of standard things like

481
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:31,700
risk of bias assessment analysis of

482
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:33,979
variation among the studies that you use

483
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,990
probably some statistical analyses to

484
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,839
predict things I didn't do any of that I

485
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,359
just gathered all the studies I could

486
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:43,158
find that fit my criteria which I'm

487
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,069
going to show all the studies I could

488
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,289
find and then just reported averages

489
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:50,599
made averages and reported variation

490
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:53,629
associated with those averages and I did

491
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:56,689
a few simple statistical test two T

492
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,700
tests so as far as the meta-analysis

493
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,740
goals study inclusion criteria that's

494
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,429
one of the basic things so what am i

495
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,159
criteria first of all the study had to

496
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:09,528
be conducted in the sahaba

497
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,649
or the Amazon biome had to be done on an

498
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:15,200
axis all soil and it had to be done in

499
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:18,769
the field with no irrigation so those

500
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:23,929
are the basic criteria that I used to

501
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:27,440
include exclude studies since I found

502
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:31,399
very few studies done in the Amazon I

503
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,409
think I found three I used studies done

504
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:36,439
on off soft soils in the Sahara as a

505
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,970
proxy for conditions in the Amazon and

506
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,990
that's really not that big

507
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:45,500
stretch think about because both seasons

508
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,710
have a really strong both biomes have a

509
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,559
really strong dry season during

510
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:54,289
basically the same months and they are a

511
00:24:51,559 --> 00:25:00,500
lot of oxisols they're a lot of the

512
00:24:54,289 --> 00:25:02,599
agriculture is done on oxisols so let's

513
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,690
quickly look at some data here dry

514
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:07,429
biomass generation kilograms per hectare

515
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,620
here permanently

516
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:12,100
announcer Sol's in Brazil and the

517
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:16,129
studies I found were all between 95 and

518
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:18,889
2018 so the number of studies here

519
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,110
looking at Brazil as a whole without

520
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:25,190
regard to soil type biome or anything

521
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:28,519
found 78 studies and the end here is

522
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:32,299
larger than the studies because some

523
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:34,700
studies had values for these parameters

524
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:37,309
biomass here for example they had

525
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,110
several values from different sites or

526
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:43,129
different years so I just included them

527
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:46,849
as a sample found three studies for the

528
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,880
Amazon and 43 for the Cercado so these

529
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,349
values put it into context in the

530
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,260
literature what's established in the

531
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:56,929
literature is six mega grams here

532
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,509
that's just 6,000 kilograms per hectare

533
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,810
as being necessary to establish notail

534
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:05,599
in Brazil so then our values here for

535
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:08,599
the Sahara are well above that and for

536
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,399
the Amazon it approaches six so it's

537
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,019
only have three studies you have to take

538
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,380
that as a grain of salt with a grain of

539
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:17,660
salt but over half of the studies that I

540
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,460
found for the dry biomass were greater

541
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,790
than six for this are hotter than the

542
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,759
Amazon so that shows that pearl millet

543
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:28,460
has the potential to create what can be

544
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,519
considered sufficient dry biomass on

545
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,640
these oxisols soils and seasonally dry

546
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,730
ecosystems

547
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,210
so then nutrients here we're looking at

548
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:42,170
nutrients in the biomass the dry biomass

549
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,659
so here we have nutrient content at 0 60

550
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,090
and 120 days

551
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,889
after desiccation and this is for

552
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:52,668
Primula that was grown for sixty days

553
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:55,098
and also grown for 180 days and so we

554
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:58,399
got two different periods for which it

555
00:26:55,098 --> 00:27:01,939
was grown and what we see here kilograms

556
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:04,358
per hectare is that basically for

557
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,759
permanently grown for sixty days

558
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:10,398
nitrogen potassium phosphorus and

559
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,798
potassium are greater then for her

560
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:15,768
mother grown for 180 days so there's

561
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,329
more nutrients in these plants when

562
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,579
they're desiccated basically at

563
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:21,408
flowering then if you let them mature

564
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:22,878
and set the seed so that's an

565
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:25,639
interesting result that'll explain a

566
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:27,738
little more that has implications for

567
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:30,978
management of pearl millet in these

568
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:33,200
systems so then what about release of

569
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:36,229
the nutrient so it's in the biomass what

570
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,129
about release well here we can see that

571
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:43,548
the release of NPK by pearl millet

572
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:45,949
biomass can be equal to the nutrients

573
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:48,979
that are exported in the cash crop so

574
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,899
looking here at soybeans and corn the

575
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:54,979
amounts of nutrients exported in four

576
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:57,038
and six mega grams of these on oxisols

577
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:59,509
oils in the sahaba

578
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,269
here we can see the nutrient content

579
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:04,548
that's released after 60 days of

580
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:07,460
decomposition so that's the end of these

581
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:09,138
orange bars and seeing these data from

582
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,960
the studies i gathered we can see that

583
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:13,758
pearl millet has the potential after 60

584
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,909
days of decomposition to replace

585
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,528
nutrients that are exported in soybeans

586
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:22,239
and corn so that's a pretty positive

587
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:25,669
result then the half-life of biomass the

588
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:28,159
studies had an average biomass of 36 for

589
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:30,019
the CN ratio so that shows that it's

590
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,559
probably a slower as far as the

591
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:38,288
decomposition goes half-life is about

592
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,288
109 days and then nutrients and

593
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:44,000
more or less than 60 here 60 days the

594
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,250
red line nutrients are all pretty much

595
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,558
near 50% or more here so that's a pretty

596
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,619
good result if after 60 days of

597
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,178
decomposition there's still a lot of

598
00:28:54,619 --> 00:29:00,048
nutrients left in the biomass and

599
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:01,909
there's also a lot that's released to

600
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:03,900
the soil that's a good result for

601
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:07,680
nutrient cycling

602
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:11,430
so then what about transfer then to the

603
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:14,640
soil the enrichment of the soil by the

604
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:18,390
pearl millet biomass so here we have

605
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,940
studies that had data for up to 20

606
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,970
centimeters for nutrients transferred

607
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,410
after 60 days of decomposition and I had

608
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,630
studies well these are the studies I

609
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:31,940
found this is the perilla and the

610
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,940
control there were no

611
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:38,270
sickled difference in the t-test I did

612
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:40,130
here but what we can see is that Perla

613
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:42,470
is able to transfer large amounts of

614
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,780
nutrients to the soil and when we think

615
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,269
about cultivation intensive cultivation

616
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:50,289
on oxisols low fertility oxisols

617
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:52,450
this is important result because

618
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,769
stainability sustainability of

619
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:58,700
agricultural activities on these soils

620
00:29:54,769 --> 00:30:01,819
is going to partially be related to be a

621
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:04,160
function of rather the ability of plant

622
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:07,569
species to absorb and efficiently

623
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:11,150
release nutrients in labile forms so

624
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:12,980
that's an interesting result and then

625
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,560
more specifically looking at the

626
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:18,470
phosphorus is transferred to the soil

627
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,450
here we've got a table now phosphorus

628
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,360
availability for soils of the state of

629
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:26,750
pata this is for umber appa

630
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:28,939
this shows the percent clay and then the

631
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,529
soil texture clay - sandy and here we

632
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,450
have low - very high concentrations of

633
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:39,589
phosphorus in the soil so remembering

634
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:42,230
that the average pea content transferred

635
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:48,069
to the soil from pearl millet was about

636
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:50,720
73 milligrams per decimeter cubed this

637
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:53,210
looking at the table we can we can see

638
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,480
that pearl millet has the potential to

639
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:00,380
raise pea levels to very high levels so

640
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,650
that could in theory reduce the need for

641
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,389
the use of phosphor fertile phosphorus

642
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,309
fertilizer

643
00:31:05,388 --> 00:31:09,469
and it's important to remember that

644
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:11,989
oxisols are the soil order it is the

645
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:15,889
soil order that has the highest capacity

646
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:17,720
for fixation of phosphorus and in the

647
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:20,298
Amazon thirty-four percent of the soils

648
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,038
are oxisols and in my region they're

649
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:24,319
more highly concentrated a little bit

650
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:27,739
north and then south of the Amazon River

651
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,418
in my region Western paadhai there's a

652
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:32,889
huge percentage of oxisols in that

653
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:32,889
region so this is an important result

654
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:40,669
there's one caveat though and that is

655
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:43,190
that these data 73 here for phosphorus

656
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:46,159
these data don't tell us anything about

657
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,720
the way that parameter accesses

658
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,539
phosphorus in the soil if it's able to

659
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,639
access sources of phosphorus that are

660
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:54,349
considered moderately label and then

661
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:57,229
leave them in more labelled forms and

662
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,509
which is really important for phosphorus

663
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,399
cycling so that brings up a research

664
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:04,730
question which is basically how can we

665
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,219
approve the availability of phosphorus

666
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:10,639
and these are egg recalled chiral soils

667
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:12,679
okay the question is other plants such

668
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:16,038
as perma the pearl millet that can mine

669
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,559
phosphorus access forms that are

670
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:22,339
moderately labile associated with iron

671
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,648
and aluminum in soil and then release it

672
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:27,589
in labile forms one mechanism would be

673
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:29,178
the release of organic acid anions by

674
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:31,638
the roots into the rice rhizosphere

675
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:34,100
which would then compete for P

676
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,508
absorption sites so that's an

677
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:38,628
interesting research question and those

678
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:40,190
data that that I gathered from the

679
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:41,808
studies don't tell us anything about

680
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,239
that

681
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:46,009
the idea would be to cultivate plants in

682
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:48,319
controlled experiments and then do a

683
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:50,538
sequential fractionation to try to

684
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,388
extract different fractions of soil

685
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:56,480
phosphorus and that would help us to

686
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:59,329
understand the capacity for Puma in this

687
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,409
case to effect changes in the sources

688
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:06,288
and reserves of phosphorus in the soil

689
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:09,470
okay so last data slide here what are

690
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:13,249
the effects of pearl millet on cash crop

691
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:15,319
yield okay here we have kilograms per

692
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:18,769
hectare and I found Studies on rice

693
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:21,678
soybeans and corn my sample size is here

694
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:24,159
I didn't find any statistical

695
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,840
differences with the simple t-tests

696
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,539
individual studies do show that there

697
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,849
are effects actually especially for rice

698
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:35,808
pearl millet does have an effect on

699
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:38,748
yields specifically associated with the

700
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:40,490
input recycling rather of phosphorus and

701
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:45,009
potassium into the soils through the

702
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:49,190
biomass however a bunch of studies I saw

703
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:52,519
that I reported and show that this

704
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:55,129
effect of increase of cash crop yield is

705
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:57,558
only possible with an input of inorganic

706
00:33:55,128 --> 00:34:00,048
nitrogen fertilizer and one of the ways

707
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:03,528
around that that I saw him in these

708
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:05,658
studies that I I gathered was the

709
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:08,539
question of intercropping intercropping

710
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:09,710
of pearl millet with species of croak

711
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:12,558
alladia sunhemp

712
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,659
and basically all the studies I saw on

713
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,000
the Oxus halls in sahaba this

714
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:19,669
intercropping resulted in higher yields

715
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,739
higher soil fertility higher yields of

716
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:25,429
the cash crop - and that's because of

717
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:30,199
the interaction between the N fixer the

718
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:32,119
sunhemp and the other benefits so that's

719
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,000
a pretty interesting result to the

720
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,970
question of intercropping

721
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,429
so to summarize some of this here they

722
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:44,439
eject the objective of the incorporation

723
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,440
of a cover crop by a farmer

724
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:48,909
to determine in this case how permanent

725
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:50,980
it would be managed in these systems for

726
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:54,730
example if the objective is just to

727
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:57,699
create biomass for mulch they can just

728
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,670
leave it basically 130 days or so is its

729
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:02,379
cycle you can leave it to grow as it

730
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,389
grows and matures even more it'll have a

731
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:10,960
higher leading concentration which could

732
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:14,529
be good for up for the biomass mulch now

733
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,750
remembering our available water balance

734
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,970
figure here with the different periods

735
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,619
of planting and harvest of soybeans and

736
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:27,339
second crop we have the question here

737
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:31,239
that if the objective is not just

738
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:33,130
biomass generation but nutrient cycling

739
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:35,759
then the idea would be try to

740
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:38,260
synchronize the planting of pearl millet

741
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,110
to maximize not just biomass but

742
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,970
nutrient transfer and from the data that

743
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,599
I was able to gather that looks to be

744
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:49,689
about 60 days of growth and 60 for

745
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,199
decomposition which fits nicely into

746
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,610
this period here of the dry season and

747
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:59,829
the four months window during the dry

748
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:04,780
season okay so now transitioning to some

749
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:09,279
present and future work in Brazil first

750
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:11,920
of all here's a map showing once again

751
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,230
the legal amazon with basically what i'm

752
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:21,670
located right there what we have is a

753
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:25,420
we've got a 30 hectare plot of land say

754
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:29,170
degraded pasture it's on a farm called

755
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,450
agua and what we want to do is create

756
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,269
sort of a model farm a demonstration

757
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:36,489
farm and an Agricultural Experiment

758
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:38,559
Research Station on this farm the owner

759
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:39,849
of this farm is a large animal

760
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,710
veterinarian

761
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:44,710
he's friend of mine he's a university

762
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,019
professor with me also and he

763
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,210
specializes in in bovine reproduction

764
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:51,849
and what he wants to do is create an

765
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,130
intensive cattle ranching system where

766
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:57,079
you've got rotations between pastures

767
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,210
and crops

768
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,179
you incorporate trees into the pastures

769
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,519
in the crops that's the integration

770
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,419
crops livestock and forest which is a

771
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,179
big deal

772
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:11,030
right now down in Brazil slowly taking

773
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:15,049
on in the Amazon region so this is our

774
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:18,860
plot of land here degraded master the

775
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:21,289
farmer is totally sold on the idea of

776
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,809
creating this project this model farm

777
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:25,130
and he's actually financed a good part

778
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,949
of the work we've been doing for the

779
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,490
last few years so this is a really great

780
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:34,719
opportunity for us

781
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:37,179
the idea would be to create sort of a

782
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,519
system like this which exists in

783
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:42,940
prodigal Mina's which is a region far

784
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,889
away in the state in the eastern part of

785
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,920
the state so you've got trees here

786
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:51,579
planted in rows with crops between the

787
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,769
trees and pastures with trees also and

788
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:56,949
then over time you rotate all of this

789
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:58,900
here's an example of soybeans with

790
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:02,889
eucalyptus trees planted in the middle

791
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,200
our idea is actually to see if we can't

792
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:07,690
plant on the topography following the

793
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,299
contour lines in that 30 hectare plot of

794
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:13,179
land that I showed that's uh this is a

795
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,099
an image from master student of mine

796
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:17,049
generated this image so that's our idea

797
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:19,119
is to do things a little bit differently

798
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:22,089
but the general idea is this is to

799
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,000
create an integrated system where you

800
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:28,509
have crops and pastures being rotated

801
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,679
when you use cover crops and also you

802
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,000
can do experiments in these these plots

803
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,809
another experiment that was just started

804
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,570
this year is attempting to say something

805
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:42,579
about the contribution of no-till

806
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:46,720
agriculture compared to conventional

807
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:49,650
agriculture in the Amazon so how does

808
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:53,889
that affect sustainability and the idea

809
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:56,410
so we have fields where no-till

810
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:58,659
agriculture soybeans planted right next

811
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,489
to conventionally planted soybeans and

812
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:02,139
that's replicated on five farms with the

813
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:04,149
same soil type and site history

814
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:07,449
basically and then we're gonna look at

815
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,608
crop productivity soil productivity and

816
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:12,039
microclimate parameters to try to say

817
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:16,900
something about no-till and Amazonian

818
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:19,570
Agrico systems soil fertility sampling

819
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:22,930
we did an intensive campaign of two

820
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,990
years of soil sampling in different

821
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:28,809
sites five different sites here in the

822
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:31,629
region integrated no-till crop pasture

823
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:35,019
rotation integrated no-till pasture

824
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:37,970
forests a managed pasture a degraded

825
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:41,119
pasture and the native forest control

826
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:44,179
so two years of data three seasons

827
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:49,130
within each year wet/dry and transition

828
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:53,059
and 720 total samples so just to show

829
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:56,539
some quick photos here the this is the

830
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:58,759
no-till corn soybean pasture site this

831
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:01,099
is managed pasture here's the

832
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,450
integration of crops livestock and

833
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:09,650
forest that forest is uh noble species

834
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:12,039
of wood mahogany Brazilian teak and a

835
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:15,170
bunch of others can't remember now

836
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:18,230
degraded pasture and then primary forest

837
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,909
so I just wanted to just include the

838
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,260
assist to show some of the things we've

839
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:28,338
been doing two years of data here three

840
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:31,099
different depths pH and the manage sites

841
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:34,789
gone up compared to the native forests

842
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:38,900
and then potential acidity here it's

843
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:41,420
gone down in comparison to the native

844
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,608
forests so in terms of availability of

845
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,980
nutrients nutrient cycling that's a

846
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:47,539
positive result

847
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,960
same thing for cation exchange capacity

848
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:54,219
and bass saturation here we can see our

849
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,960
sites in the manage sites basically

850
00:40:54,219 --> 00:41:00,679
cation exchange has gone up compared to

851
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,269
the forest and also base separation so

852
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,679
once again in terms of nutrient cycling

853
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:07,420
we can consider that a pot as a positive

854
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,559
result

855
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,980
more specifically now looking at

856
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:15,769
available soil phosphorus what we have

857
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:19,190
here in the manage sites no-till crop

858
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:21,469
pasture and the crop livestock forest we

859
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:23,960
have two years of data showing there's

860
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:27,500
more available phosphorus in these sites

861
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,900
20 meters in the soil compared to the

862
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,909
other sites so that's a really

863
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,099
interesting result when you think about

864
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:37,338
the problems with phosphorus

865
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:39,430
availability in the soil and also the

866
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:42,739
question of phosphorus a more

867
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:46,279
geopolitical question of phosphorus

868
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:47,989
reserves in the world and that will only

869
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,750
get more difficult for Brazil as time

870
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:53,169
goes of course

871
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:59,010
so concluding here I have no idea about

872
00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:01,900
time is that clock right yeah okay and

873
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:04,720
wanted to talk about a little bit about

874
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:10,150
expansion here and knowledge flows

875
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:12,219
amongst farmers we do a group together

876
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,410
with people from a brothel which are

877
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:16,059
part of our group we do these sort of

878
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:17,980
workshops where we'll get out and talk

879
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:21,279
to farmers this is something I've seen

880
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,949
here at Cornell and Matt Ryan's lab that

881
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,830
apparently they do really well

882
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:27,699
get together with farmers in the field

883
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:30,159
talk about their work

884
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:32,858
show recent research results bring them

885
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,019
here even and I think that's really

886
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:36,940
important to do and a little bit of done

887
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,710
of this there has shown me that there

888
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,030
are a lot of benefits to knowing what it

889
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,970
is that the people that are on the

890
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:46,269
frontline think what is their perception

891
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:47,289
in this particular workshop we wanted to

892
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:49,960
know what they thought were their

893
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:51,279
barriers to sustainable agricultural

894
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,070
activities what are the barriers

895
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,500
preventing them from planting trees and

896
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,390
building a nursery and engaging in some

897
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,630
of these activities on their on their

898
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:03,940
lands so we send out an invitation

899
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:07,599
doesn't appear too well here and we got

900
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:11,230
a really good response we talked with

901
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,599
about 20 soy bean corn farmers and

902
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:16,780
cattle ranchers some images here from

903
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,359
them from the event the way it works is

904
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,040
that will each member of our group will

905
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,389
give a five-minute maybe 10 minute

906
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,039
presentation on something that we're

907
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:25,659
working on and then we'll get together

908
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:27,639
with the farmers and sort of like a

909
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:30,129
brainstorming session where they'll

910
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:32,980
write down on small pieces of paper what

911
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,900
they think are barriers and then we'll

912
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,309
come up to the front of the room and put

913
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,680
them on the board and tally everything

914
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:42,429
up and what we end up creating is like

915
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:45,848
sort of a mental map of what this group

916
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:50,230
thinks our barriers and in this case

917
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:52,510
here the most important of these factors

918
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,990
here and the spyder plot was a lack of

919
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:58,510
land title um probably isn't a big

920
00:43:55,989 --> 00:44:00,519
problem here but in the brazilian amazon

921
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,619
it's a huge problem a lot of farmers

922
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,619
don't have title to the land so if you

923
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:05,090
don't have title

924
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:08,329
you really can't do a whole lot in terms

925
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:10,340
of getting credit from a bank to do some

926
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:12,369
of these incorporate some of these

927
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:15,200
sustainable activities on your property

928
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:17,480
so they know about a lot of this stuff

929
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,699
and they want to do it but without land

930
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,559
title it really makes things very

931
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:24,049
difficult for them so that was one of

932
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,509
the most important things the other was

933
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:29,720
the lack of technical assistance in the

934
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:32,540
region all the farmers basically said

935
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:34,389
that there's a big lack of of people

936
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:36,980
that are qualified to guide them through

937
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:39,409
these sort of processes and techniques

938
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,659
and things so what they end up doing is

939
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:45,679
is within their community

940
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:48,649
they end up looking to one person who

941
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,219
they perceive as being like the best of

942
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,260
them

943
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,939
you know they look up to this person and

944
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,860
in the case of this group there is a

945
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,990
farmer that they all mentioned that I

946
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,910
know personally this farmer they say

947
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:01,729
well that guy you know he reads he

948
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:03,589
studies he knows the literature and he's

949
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,639
he's able to incorporate new techniques

950
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:09,829
into his system so he does it they'll

951
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,690
look up to him they'll actually consult

952
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,150
with him and maybe follow his lead even

953
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,599
and so for us as a research group that's

954
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,950
really important to know because if you

955
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,349
if you can maintain the communication

956
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:24,349
line open with that one farmer who's

957
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:26,389
perceived to be you know the best then

958
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:29,089
you can that's sort of a conduit to be

959
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:32,259
able to get to the rest of the farmers

960
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:34,880
so that was an interesting result for me

961
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:38,420
participating in these workshops so to

962
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,940
summarize here then final comments I

963
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,050
mentioned that there was about a four

964
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,539
month window

965
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:48,080
dry season where we can incorporate a

966
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:50,570
drought resistant cover crop to improve

967
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:55,579
soil fertility generate biomass for

968
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:59,840
no-till pearl millet may be able to fit

969
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:02,750
this niche because it's able to generate

970
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,490
sufficient dry biomass and and also the

971
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,079
question of sixty days of growth and 60

972
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:08,750
days of decomposition to liberate

973
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,529
nutrients if it's managed that way it

974
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:13,949
could fit the niche

975
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:17,019
the dry biomass values for no-till

976
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:19,239
combining those from the Amazon and the

977
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:21,159
Serrano we got a little more than six

978
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,409
mega grams per hectare the literature

979
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:26,319
says six is sufficient to establish

980
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:30,159
no-till in Brazil but I question that I

981
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,930
put right here why this value the

982
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,690
citation that I saw everywhere that

983
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:37,539
everybody uses this from 2001 but I

984
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:40,150
didn't never saw anything about why six

985
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:42,579
mega grams was was established as the

986
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:45,010
correct value so that would need to be

987
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:47,860
tested also the idea would be to get out

988
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:49,630
into the Amazon in general two different

989
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,570
farms and document the use of cover

990
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,630
crops in the region that would involve a

991
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,070
lot of traveling that kind of thing

992
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,190
also test several types of cover crops

993
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:02,500
and controlled field experiments the

994
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:05,019
question of phosphorus cycling the the

995
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,539
ability to access moderate labile

996
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:09,759
reserves in soil and make them labile

997
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:12,210
this transformation phosphorus is very

998
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,240
interesting that should be investigated

999
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:18,670
for pearl millet and then the model

1000
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,839
experimental farm that's going to be

1001
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:24,490
something that's going to allow us to

1002
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:26,829
engage with farmers over time to show

1003
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:29,019
them what we're up to maybe show some

1004
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:30,940
new ideas and technologies and find out

1005
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:34,630
you know what their perceived

1006
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:38,860
difficulties are okay acknowledgments so

1007
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:40,840
I'd like to acknowledge copies it's a

1008
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,019
agency that's part of the Ministry of

1009
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,059
Education in Brazil they funded my

1010
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:48,759
proposal to come here and stay for a

1011
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:51,279
year on a sort of sabbatical I suppose

1012
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,680
it is so thank you very much copies the

1013
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,930
Cornell librarians when I started this

1014
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:59,679
work when I my first idea was do this

1015
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:01,659
grant was it systematic review sort of

1016
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,389
thing I went to the man library and I

1017
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:06,519
settle out with the Cornell librarians

1018
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:09,789
and talked with them great group of

1019
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:11,829
people really knowledgeable they they

1020
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:12,070
really sat with me helped me out quite a

1021
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:13,630
bit

1022
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,150
showed me all the great resource that

1023
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:20,980
the library has so thank you Cornell

1024
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:22,750
librarians Matt Ryan and the SCL I have

1025
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,699
to say thank you very much

1026
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,949
he's welcomed me with open arms since

1027
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:27,939
I've been here I've learned a lot with

1028
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:29,618
them even though we're from different

1029
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,740
areas it doesn't matter we're all here

1030
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:36,068
to learn I suppose so you know I thank

1031
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:45,879
them Matt especially very much and then

1032
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:48,039
of course finally family mmm sorry can't

1033
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,700
forget the family all of us it's the

1034
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:54,369
most important thing my family has been

1035
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:56,858
very patient with me they've come to a

1036
00:48:54,369 --> 00:49:02,260
new place a new culture learn a new

1037
00:48:56,858 --> 00:49:04,389
language and accepted the challenge 100%

1038
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,430
and I've been behind me the whole time

1039
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:08,980
that I've been here working been in

1040
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:11,139
library preparing this talk the paper

1041
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:23,679
and everything so uh we all can't forget

1042
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:31,389
our family thank you very much yeah I

1043
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:35,919
think so I don't know please oh jeez

1044
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:37,750
yeah um well there is a process thing is

1045
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,940
it cost money so a lot of people don't

1046
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:45,480
do it first of all it can be complicated

1047
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:50,050
like a lot of things in Brazil I think

1048
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,849
as long as there's no big conflict like

1049
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,190
between two people who say they're the

1050
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:56,619
owner of the land you can get it it just

1051
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:59,800
takes a certain amount of resources and

1052
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:01,690
money to do it and then that's not even

1053
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,010
the biggest issue with the farmers they

1054
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,950
want to know what the benefits will be

1055
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,510
if they if they get land title and after

1056
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:10,960
they get it they'll have to be

1057
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:14,410
registered into the there's a registry I

1058
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,269
can't remember the name right now but

1059
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:18,250
it's a national registry and then

1060
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:20,199
they'll have an obligation to do a whole

1061
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:22,539
bunch of things with their land geo

1062
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:24,399
referencing and report to the government

1063
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:26,230
they'll be monitored and his side of

1064
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,380
things so a lot of the landowners just

1065
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,088
say to heck with it so it's not that

1066
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,289
they can't do it like I said if as long

1067
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:34,059
as there's no there's no conflict

1068
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:35,980
between different landowners they're

1069
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:38,108
open to do the process

1070
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,070
it's just that sometimes they proceed

1071
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:40,690
that there really aren't that many

1072
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:49,349
benefits even though they would be able

1073
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:49,349
to get credit from the back yeah please

1074
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:27,940
perhaps four major droughts that boost

1075
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:35,679
your crops ten right well I did show you

1076
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:36,849
that actually that's some pretty it's an

1077
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,039
interesting point to be able to

1078
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:41,559
incorporate into the first draft of the

1079
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,329
paper which I didn't do so that's

1080
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,909
interesting I did show the figure I

1081
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:48,430
think of two hundred and forty days of

1082
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:50,588
decomposition so I could actually go

1083
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:54,250
back see those studies that went that

1084
00:51:50,588 --> 00:51:56,949
far to see what the soil enrichment

1085
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:58,059
factor would be I'm gonna try to

1086
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:01,210
remember that cuz that's actually pretty

1087
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:03,759
good yeah thank you thanks a lot very

1088
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:07,720
interesting certainty composition

1089
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,339
nutrient recycling component it sounded

1090
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:11,169
like you are sort of targeting having

1091
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:14,559
nutrient availability when the next crop

1092
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:16,180
was planted I have two questions about

1093
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,730
that one is would you want that actually

1094
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:23,078
to be more at the time when the major

1095
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:25,240
nutrient is no that would be hard to

1096
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,460
court a suppose I mean look on do it

1097
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:31,088
would just be a longer time to grow the

1098
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:35,889
crank just say oh maybe grow a little

1099
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:38,078
longer you know looking at that period

1100
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:39,848
of availability of the nutrients having

1101
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:43,000
more of an overlap with uptake of the

1102
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:46,240
suspects subsequently crime the other

1103
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,199
kind of half of my question is you know

1104
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:51,839
with the with the moisture

1105
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,929
cycle have you thought about that

1106
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:58,230
affecting all the processes you know the

1107
00:52:54,929 --> 00:53:00,089
growth in the decomposition like were

1108
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:03,929
these crops planted during that early

1109
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:07,950
year I assume they were give me planted

1110
00:53:03,929 --> 00:53:10,769
during the drive the dry period so how

1111
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:13,230
would that affect well just I guess the

1112
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:14,610
basic question is just work with the

1113
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:17,250
studies you're looking at where they all

1114
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,809
come across all planted during that Wow

1115
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,659
right right right

1116
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:25,469
um no that's something also that I could

1117
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:28,109
I could look at sort of shore up make

1118
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:31,349
stronger the the my case and in the

1119
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:34,920
paper that's actually pretty important I

1120
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:37,019
need to see when these were planted see

1121
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,840
in fact if they're actually during the

1122
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:41,519
real dry period yeah it makes sense

1123
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,559
better look at that I'm gonna write

1124
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:49,009
these down mentally I guess jeez

1125
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:53,610
was there one please yeah again really

1126
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:55,320
the you kind of alluded to the fact that

1127
00:53:53,610 --> 00:54:00,390
that you might want to combine the pearl

1128
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:02,280
millet with like um so why why did you

1129
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:04,289
not I mean in the end you didn't come

1130
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,840
back to that but would that make sense

1131
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:14,190
even if you follow one with soybean and

1132
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:16,950
maybe my yeah well I mean I probably

1133
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:19,800
should have not just here but also in

1134
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:23,189
the paper expanded on that paper was

1135
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:26,250
already it's probably too long this also

1136
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:29,610
in time constraints and everything but

1137
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:34,010
there's no question apparently the

1138
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:37,500
permit doesn't release enough nitrogen

1139
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:39,210
in some cases it gets sequestered in the

1140
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:43,079
biomass during decomposition something

1141
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:46,590
so combining it with the Sun hemp would

1142
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,779
be an excellent idea because the papers

1143
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:50,430
I've seen says it works I mean first of

1144
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,680
all that's the first thing the second

1145
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:54,359
thing is that Sun him is used I know

1146
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:57,480
personally a couple of different farmers

1147
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,670
they use it but they only use it once in

1148
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,548
a while and it's just for breaking

1149
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:05,148
nematode cycles

1150
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:07,969
basically is what it is but uh it would

1151
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:10,368
definitely I think you'd have to because

1152
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:13,778
you know adding what is it a hundred and

1153
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:16,399
twenty kilograms of nitrogen per hectare

1154
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:18,619
you can avoid that maybe putting in the

1155
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:21,139
sent out so I'm gonna try to expand on

1156
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:22,608
that too if I can maybe cut something

1157
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:24,648
out of the paper and include a section

1158
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:29,168
on intercropping I think it would make

1159
00:55:24,648 --> 00:55:29,168
my case a little bit strong

1160
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:45,440
this has been a production of Cornell
