University here in the garden of the

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,320
meavy educational center three

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,080
cornellians came to build a piece of

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,359
community-minded living sculpture with

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,799
students to start the planning process

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
they made a list of goals for the

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
project and everyone agreed creating a

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,800
private and quiet shaded space would

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,479
draw community members to the area to

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,679
create this contemplative space they

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,839
built this tunnel and Dome from Willow

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,840
and

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Dogwood the design of these pieces is

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,000
very nice the Dome sits within the curve

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,039
of the twisting tunnel and the entire

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,960
space is designed to maximize people's

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,800
interactions with the

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,518
sculptures while the layout of this

23
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,959
piece is interesting this sculpture is

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,239
seen better days this tunnel was created

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,000
using cuting of Willow and Dogwood which

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,118
were planted in the ground in the hopes

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,640
that they would grow roots and survive

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,519
this is a difficult practice because

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,200
fresh cuttings require a lot of water

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,199
and Care in order to become established

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,118
the more successful parts of the tunnel

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,320
are made from Willows like this one

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,478
which has survived because of its

34
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,319
thicker diameter one of the strengths of

35
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,438
living sculpture is the adaptability of

36
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,239
its components while this project may

37
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,078
not have turned out as planned this

38
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,560
tunnel and Dome are still effective

39
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:33,239
because plants like this bean vine and

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,640
these sunflowers are growing to fill in

41
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,879
the gaps it can be frustrating to work

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,519
with living materials but every project

43
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,519
has the potential to grow into something

44
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,519
new
