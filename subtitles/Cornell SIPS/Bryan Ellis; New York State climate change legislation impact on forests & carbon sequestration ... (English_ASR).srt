1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,559
my name is brian ellis i

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,039
am the section leader for the climate

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,198
forestry and carbon section in the

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,320
division of lamp and forest the new york

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,920
state dec so that's quite a mouthful

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,240
but today what i'm going to try to talk

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
to everyone about is

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,839
um

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,559
the new york state stats and trends of

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,119
our forest so we learned a lot about

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,159
carbon stock versus carbon sequestration

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,919
today

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,519
some things that affect it and i'm going

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
to talk about

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,879
the challenge that we have ahead

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,520
in terms of where new york forests are

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,599
so the status of those forests and then

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,359
i'm going to talk about some policy

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,198
issues talk about

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,719
the climate leadership and community

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,960
protection act the clcpa and the

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,439
forestry recommendations that we've made

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,280
there to help us meet our climate goals

26
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,719
by 2050

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,118
and a brief overview of of those main

28
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,519
strategies that we've we've identified

29
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,959
for combating climate change through

30
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,759
through forests

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,759
is keeping forests as forests and that's

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,000
avoiding conversion of our forests to

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,079
non-forested use

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
improved forest management within our

35
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,519
current forested areas

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,680
aforestation and reforestation

37
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,359
urban forestry for trees in our urban

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
areas which

39
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,400
have multiple benefits in terms of

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,478
carbon sequestration but also

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,079
cooling effects in those urban heat

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,438
islands

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,279
reducing energy costs for in those areas

44
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,279
and then i'm going to touch briefly on

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
bioeconomy but tim went over that really

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,159
well

47
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,519
and the benefits of it and you know

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
that's something that

49
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,879
uh the recommendations in the four feet

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,200
panel

51
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,839
outlay that need to be pushed further

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,200
and we need to really incentivize um

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,719
getting more of that on the landscape

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
and then i'm going to talk about some

55
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,599
current dec programs opportunities for

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
landowners um you know if we have

57
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,280
landowners out on the call here um that

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
dec has

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,919
um what you can do on your properties

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
um and obviously

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,399
uh this is work that dec has been doing

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,199
for a while um but hasn't um

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,719
had as much of a climate lens on it and

64
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
it also you know is something that's

65
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,598
going to need to be ramped up if we're

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,599
really going to

67
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,598
make an impact moving forward

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,199
so just a brief overview of the the

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,639
clcpa

70
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,959
it establi it was passed um a few years

71
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,079
ago an established climate action

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,878
council

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,000
to

74
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,318
which was made to develop a scoping plan

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,439
which is basically a plan of action for

76
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,679
us to meet our climate goals in new york

77
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,639
and those goals are

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,280
70

79
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,878
renewable energy by 2030 100 percent

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,039
zero emissions from electrical

81
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:12,560
generation by 2040 and 85 reduction in

82
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,959
greenhouse gas emissions uh by 2050 with

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,080
the the goal of net zero emissions in

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,360
new york by 2050 and so if you look at

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,840
those that 85 reduction in greenhouse

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,560
gas emissions um getting to that 100

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
percent the last 15 of that would be

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
from carbon sequestration within our

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
forests

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
and so that's you know where we're going

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,640
is looking at the carbon sequestration

92
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,840
rates of new york's forest working on

93
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,199
increasing that and and offsetting about

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
um 15

95
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,598
of

96
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:49,679
our emissions in new york uh with

97
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,679
with sequestration from our forests

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,199
so a brief overview of of our forests in

99
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,878
new york and tim tim talked about the

100
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,238
trends of forests in new york a little

101
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,318
bit um

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,200
and i think it was really important for

103
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,518
us to think about the the loss of

104
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,280
forests in new york um from the 18th

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,599
century into the 19th century um

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,799
and you know the the steady incline in

107
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,358
force that we've had as

108
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,040
forests have regrown on agricultural

109
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,959
lands and that's a really important

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
context to

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
think about when we're talking about

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,160
forests in new york so we have about

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,400
18.6 million acres of forest in new york

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
currently and that's about 16

115
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,198
or 62 percent of new york forest

116
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,799
and when i'm talking about these four

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
stats which i'm going to talk about for

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
the next couple slides here most of the

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
information that i'm talking about comes

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,639
from the forest inventory analysis

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,720
program or fia program and that's run by

122
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,000
the forest service it's permanent plots

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,199
across new york landscapes that

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,519
it monitors new york forests and we get

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
annual reports from those as well as

126
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,439
five year reports which are much more in

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
depth so the most recent one was

128
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,519
published in 2020

129
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,959
and that's where most of the data that

130
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:11,359
i'll be talking about in that comes from

131
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,599
but um so the the most concerning part

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
of this trend and as we you know it's

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
really great to think of new york forest

134
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,719
regrowing we've had increase in forest

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,360
area for over 50 years in new york state

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
um in close to 100 years now

137
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,479
and but in the last 10 years we've been

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,879
losing forests in new york um so since

139
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,399
about 2012 we've had a decrease of about

140
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,360
one percent of forest area

141
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,439
um and we're seeing when you look at you

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,160
break down that force loss we're seeing

143
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,879
that about 49 of it is from agriculture

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,120
and about 33 of it is from development

145
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,279
so you know this kind of tells us

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
that

147
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,599
we've kind of gained a lot of that force

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
that we we would gain naturally from

149
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
people abandoning agricultural fields

150
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,319
we're starting to see you know some

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,079
farmers take back those areas um and

152
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
then we're also seeing you know lots of

153
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,478
developments sprawl into our forested

154
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,439
areas and and affect those

155
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,000
those forested areas and i think um

156
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,399
as we look at the status of new york

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,879
forests and the gains and losses over

158
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:20,478
the years we'll typically see a flux

159
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:23,279
between agriculture and forests

160
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,719
every every year or you know every five

161
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,198
year cycle that we get these more

162
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,560
in-depth reports and so that's less

163
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,079
concerning because those areas are

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
natural areas that will be able to

165
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,399
regrow over time

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,478
the loss to development is definitely a

167
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,079
more concerning loss in that you know

168
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,079
those areas are definitely harder for

169
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,199
forests to reclaim or more permanent

170
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,159
loss and

171
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,680
um as tim laid out those are definitely

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,960
a big carbon uh release when we when we

173
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
talk about

174
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,000
loss to development

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,038
and so the next thing that i think is

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,918
important to discuss

177
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,318
when talking about these goals and

178
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,038
um

179
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,879
and the forest of new york is to

180
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,918
understand where our forests are in new

181
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,598
york um who owns our forest so we can

182
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,519
can think about it how to effect

183
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,038
management across the forests in new

184
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:20,719
york so um as many people here know

185
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,800
about 3.1 million acres of forest area

186
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,680
in new york is in the adirondack and

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,759
catskill park as well as you know uh

188
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
state parks and so those are areas that

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
are not managed they're

190
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,598
gaining

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,840
carbon stocks over time but you know as

192
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,918
they regrow we're gonna slow the

193
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,399
sequestration rate of those forests is

194
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,639
gonna continue to slow until you know we

195
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,560
reach kind of an equilibrium in those

196
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,079
areas and there's not a lot of

197
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
management that can happen in those

198
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,120
areas

199
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,560
but there are important carbon stores on

200
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
our landscape

201
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,319
in addition to that the state owns about

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,918
800 000 acres of state forest land

203
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,439
across new york

204
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,839
and those are actively managed forests

205
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,719
that are green certified

206
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,638
and

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
and their timber harvesting occurs on

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
those areas

209
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,758
but if you break that down that's not a

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,599
lot of the 18.6 million acres of forest

211
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,520
in new york and the rest of that is

212
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,199
privately owned um and so 74 of new york

213
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,758
forests are privately owned and if we're

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,598
gonna and so that's 69

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,240
of the carbon stocks uh on your forests

216
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,479
are owned by private landowners so if

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,360
you're going to make an impact in

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,278
terms of in the carbon stores and carbon

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,399
and forest space in new york you're

220
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,559
going to have to work with private

221
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,200
landowners and that's going to be a real

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,759
challenge because there's over 700 000

223
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,440
landowners

224
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:54,480
who own forests across new york

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,240
about 13.6 million acres of forest and

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,159
again we get this information from the

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,159
forest service and they have a national

228
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,519
woodland owner survey which they they

229
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,838
send out

230
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,919
every few years to to talk to woodland

231
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,080
owners about things that they care about

232
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,838
to figure out how many woodland donors

233
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
there are out and and we

234
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,720
use those statistics when trying to make

235
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
these kind of decisions um and so

236
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
about

237
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:23,519
close to 200 000 of those owners own 10

238
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,839
acres or more um which is about 68 of

239
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,240
the private land um and so you know i

240
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
break that statistic out just because um

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
ten acres

242
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,639
uh is an important

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,480
kind of uh reflection inflection point

244
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,319
for where you know you can do some

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
active management on those properties

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
where you know below 10 acres there's

247
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
there are some management actions that

248
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,079
can happen but really to to have a

249
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,680
timber harvest and to really actively

250
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,759
manage your properties you know we want

251
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,919
to focus on those forests that would

252
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,559
land owners who have a larger impact and

253
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,799
would be able to to do more sustainable

254
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
management on their properties

255
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,159
the concerning thing when thinking about

256
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,240
these landowners is that only 25 of them

257
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,480
of landowners surveyed in new york uh

258
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,959
used the forester uh professional

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,480
forester during their last harvest so

260
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,239
you know a lot of landowners are out

261
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
there managing their forests but aren't

262
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
um getting the

263
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,320
professional advice that they should be

264
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,320
when managing their properties um

265
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
so that's something that's going to so

266
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
private forests are really where the

267
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,639
take-home message here is where we're

268
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
really going to be able to make an

269
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,838
impact um when thinking about

270
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,680
increasing carbon stores across new york

271
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
and so the next thing

272
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,439
thinking about our our forests is what's

273
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,360
the structure of new york's forest so

274
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,640
we've talked about the the area of

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,120
forests increasing in new york over time

276
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,879
but um and that

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
is and there's a general aging of our

278
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,720
forests as well and so tim talked a lot

279
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,879
about um

280
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,879
the the trajectory of carbon

281
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,159
sequestration in the forest

282
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,439
um and carbon stores in a forest and if

283
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,759
you remember some of the things that he

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,200
talked about as as the force age is it

285
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,720
slows down and um you know we know that

286
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
our forests have been grown in new york

287
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,720
and the the data shows us that we have

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
an aging forest in new york so um over

289
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,800
the last number of years we've seen

290
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,560
decreases in the seedling sapling age

291
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:25,278
class forests and some of that is is

292
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,439
these forests regrowing we also have a

293
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,278
big regeneration issue in new york as

294
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
well um and

295
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,759
so that you know

296
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,879
leads to

297
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,679
a lot of concern over regrowth of forest

298
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,799
mostly due to increased deer populations

299
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,799
and invasive species

300
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,919
and so as those four stage we're going

301
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
to

302
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,000
they're going to slow down in terms of

303
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
carbon sequestration

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,958
the other thing to to note um when

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,039
looking at the data is that 43 of our

306
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,399
forests are moderately or poorly stocked

307
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,159
in new york and so

308
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,399
um

309
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,319
that's you know something that to take

310
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,879
into account that you know a lot of

311
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,639
those areas uh you know could have

312
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,720
higher stocking in those forests they're

313
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,600
degraded forest either through invasive

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,040
species or past management practices

315
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
and so there's going to be a lot of work

316
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,519
to be done within our current forest to

317
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,000
improve that stocking have them

318
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,039
fully occupy those sites

319
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,200
and maximize sequestration and carbon

320
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,039
storage within the forest there is new

321
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
york

322
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,838
and that's a pretty large area to be

323
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,958
working with

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,360
um we've also seen you know that kind of

325
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,078
leads into the same topic and increase

326
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,320
in what we in the four forestry world

327
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,278
call collar unacceptable growing stocks

328
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,519
so trees that would um not grow into a

329
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,759
forest product so we've seen an increase

330
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,519
in that in our forests over the last 10

331
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,000
years but that's a trend that we've been

332
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,480
seeing uh for a number of years so you

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,799
know that leads us to believe that

334
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,600
there's invasive species affecting our

335
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,359
forests out there um that there's past

336
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,759
management practices that you know have

337
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
taken the best and left the rest and as

338
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,399
those trees age you know they're not

339
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,560
going to have the economic value that

340
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
they would have um so that's going to

341
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,919
affect the type of management that's

342
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,079
going to be able to happen on those

343
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,399
properties and if those kind of harvests

344
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,719
are going to be economically viable or

345
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,958
if incentives um

346
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
are going to be necessary to to

347
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,039
encourage

348
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,278
and promote uh sustainable forestry on

349
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,278
those properties

350
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,519
the last thing i want to talk about

351
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:37,360
um in terms of our forest to kind of put

352
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,679
our uh policies into

353
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,759
into context here are the the tree

354
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,519
species in new york and tim talked a lot

355
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,360
about a little bit about assisted

356
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,600
migration um but if you look and i think

357
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
that's really an important point to hit

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,399
on

359
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
is what three species we have in our

360
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,399
forests new york where where those are

361
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,639
trending and so

362
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
red maple is a

363
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,120
is the most

364
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,078
uh common tree in new york by far

365
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,720
it's less commercially bought

366
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,719
less commercially valuable than a lot of

367
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,680
other trees in new york we've seen an

368
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,839
increase in this this tree species

369
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,439
in new york and a decrease in sugar

370
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,320
maple which is a much more valuable

371
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,839
species and longer-lived species

372
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,160
um

373
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,839
it's i kind of important to know as i

374
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,319
move through this is that eastern

375
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,040
hemlock and white ash are number four

376
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
and five as the most uh common trees in

377
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,679
new york

378
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,159
um

379
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,239
so you know we have two really big

380
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,078
invasive species that are affecting both

381
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
of those and that's going to be a really

382
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,559
big concern moving forward in terms of

383
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,399
the loss of those species from our

384
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,518
landscapes and the impact that that's

385
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,958
going to have on our forest as a whole

386
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,879
but overall we've seen relatively stable

387
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,479
species composition in our forests over

388
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,198
the last 10 years

389
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,360
with some gains and losses

390
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:05,519
it's one resource i just wanted to point

391
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,560
people out to is the usda tree atlas

392
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,480
and i

393
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,879
we can send a link around for that but

394
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,159
it's an interesting resource for folks

395
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,720
to look at projections on where tree

396
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,719
species

397
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,838
will will do well in terms of

398
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
future climate predictions so you know

399
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,199
if you've got some tree species that

400
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,439
you're looking at in your area that's

401
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,759
that's an interesting uh resource to

402
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,760
look at

403
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
all right and then

404
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,719
kind of the elephant in the room here is

405
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,359
uh

406
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,560
is invasive species and

407
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,519
um

408
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,838
we are affected by them

409
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,679
in new york especially we are affected

410
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,759
by them more than any other

411
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,599
state in the united states as you can

412
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,839
see by this map here we have more

413
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,278
invasive species

414
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,480
for county than than any other state in

415
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,360
the country and that's really due to the

416
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,360
you know commercial

417
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,639
commercial

418
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,000
commerce that is happening the ports

419
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,360
that we have

420
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,879
in new york city as well as um

421
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,839
as the

422
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,958
the seaway as well those

423
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,320
are really big entry points for

424
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:23,119
invasive species coming in on uh wood

425
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
wood packaging material like pallets

426
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,078
and some of the

427
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,040
the major invasive species that we're

428
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,719
seeing affecting new york um right now

429
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,919
asian longhorn beetles a really big

430
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
threat

431
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,599
but seems to be something that

432
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,879
has

433
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,839
we've had more effect um in controlling

434
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,320
um and recently have eradicated it from

435
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,480
some parts of long island that

436
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
that we had it in the past um there's

437
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,600
emerald ash borer which is widely

438
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,360
affecting ash trees across new york and

439
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,120
is having a really big impact on our

440
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
forest

441
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,278
hemlock wooly adelgid which was talked

442
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,159
about earlier has been in new york since

443
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,880
the 1980s and has been

444
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,038
been moving northward and has had a

445
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,120
really dramatic effect on

446
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,359
on the hemlocks in new york especially

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,879
in the hudson vat lower hudson valley in

448
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,719
the finger lakes region we're really

449
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,600
starting to see mortality in recent

450
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,480
years

451
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,958
due to hemlock willie delegate and

452
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,078
in the last few years we also have seen

453
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,439
this pest move up into the adirondacks

454
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:29,440
which at one point folks thought

455
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,080
might be able to resist hemlock wooly

456
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
delja due to the cold temperatures but

457
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,399
over time as

458
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,678
hwa has moved northward

459
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,480
it seems to have become very

460
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,320
weather and cold resistant it's doing

461
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,279
really well and that's where we have our

462
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,439
largest stocks of of hemlocks in new

463
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,839
york the most the the densest

464
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,679
populations of hemlocks in new york and

465
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,079
so that could be a real concern in the

466
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,240
next 20 or 30 years as hemlock will

467
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,480
adelgid moves up in that area

468
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,640
kate gets a foothold and then uh really

469
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,200
affects those forests in those areas

470
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
that some of them hemlock is the most

471
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,160
popul

472
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,640
common species in those in those areas

473
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,080
other species that we see affecting

474
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
forests the new york southern pine

475
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,960
beetle

476
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,839
has been found on long island it has

477
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,440
killed

478
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,480
thousands of acres

479
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,080
of pitch pine in long island

480
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,839
it's a species that

481
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,399
had never been found this far north

482
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,240
before it's common in the south

483
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,000
but due to climate change and warming

484
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,359
temperatures you know we're seeing it

485
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,798
expand its range uh into new york area

486
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,240
and so

487
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,000
that's going to be a really big concern

488
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,839
i know that even

489
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,798
in the last few years we've trapped

490
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:48,159
individuals uh much farther north than

491
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,400
long island um and so you know dec is

492
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,759
continually monitoring the pests to see

493
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,759
if we can to find it or in infestations

494
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,160
north of long island

495
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,319
you know the schwanngangs uh the albany

496
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,240
pine bush areas like that which we are

497
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,879
really concerned about the impact they

498
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,759
can have if that test takes a hold it

499
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
can

500
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,119
wipe out like in the south um hundreds

501
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,678
of acres

502
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,399
in a really short amount of time

503
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,720
spotted lanternflies and other ones that

504
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,280
might not be causing you know extreme

505
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,679
mortality um but could reduce

506
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,599
productivity and impact regeneration for

507
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,880
us so it's another test that we're

508
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,199
keeping an eye on

509
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,600
gypsy moth which

510
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,480
was very prevalent on our landscape last

511
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,399
year is also affecting affecting our

512
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,240
forests reducing productivity and can

513
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
cause widespread mortality at high

514
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,839
populations and of course touch on

515
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,840
disease

516
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,839
there's a variety of other species that

517
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,798
that have a large impact on our forests

518
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,759
and

519
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,599
this all compounds the problem and

520
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,000
speaks to kind issue that tim was

521
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,639
talking about in terms of permanence of

522
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,359
the carbon stores on those those forests

523
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,360
so it's important for us to to combat

524
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,879
those in order to

525
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,319
protect our forests and improve

526
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,960
sequestration across new york

527
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,399
so i won't um spend too much time on

528
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
this but this is just kind of an

529
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
overview slide and a good um

530
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,319
graphic in my mind on

531
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,880
the carbon cycle between forests

532
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,720
and um you know the important thing is

533
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
here is that young forest sequester

534
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,079
carbon faster mature forests store

535
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,759
carbon longer and carbon is released

536
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,558
from forests through things like land

537
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:34,079
use change insects and disease wildfire

538
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,759
and decomposition and harvests do have a

539
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,158
you know i would say the harvest do have

540
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,919
an impact on on carbon stores but

541
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
especially if those products go to

542
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,320
durable goods like we talked about in

543
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,400
the previous uh presentation

544
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,279
um you know that carbon forward long

545
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,038
term and can have a huge benefit

546
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,879
in terms of

547
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:58,079
continued sequestration forest

548
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,080
management and and climate change

549
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,519
so

550
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
just to kind of bring this back to a

551
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,240
policy lens now that we've put it into

552
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,038
context and where our new york forests

553
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,038
are currently

554
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,319
we're looking at the graph on the left

555
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,480
here talks about our sequestration goals

556
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,158
and the current sequestration rate in

557
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,640
new york forest

558
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,600
so how many million metric tons per year

559
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:28,559
our forests are sequestering and in

560
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,558
about 1990 so 30 years ago or so we were

561
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,440
storing about 30 million metric tons of

562
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,919
carbon um we've seen that rate decrease

563
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,558
as our forest has aged been affected by

564
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,880
invasive species

565
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,000
to you know about 25

566
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,600
million metric tons today 26 somewhere

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
around there and we again we get this

568
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,678
data from

569
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,480
the forest service uh inventory analysis

570
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,360
project as well as i'm using some land

571
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
cover

572
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,558
uh data as well to look at

573
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
using satellite imagery to see where

574
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,678
forests are and make some calculations

575
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,240
there and so looking forward we're

576
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,000
hoping to try to reverse that trend by

577
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,679
2030 through our strategies um in terms

578
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,880
of keeping forests as forests and

579
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,400
improving forest management a4 station

580
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
reforestation

581
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,679
adding trees to our urban landscapes and

582
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,280
then

583
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,960
using good forest management and

584
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,480
bioeconomy

585
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,319
to

586
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,279
to sequester carbon and we're going to

587
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,240
need to

588
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,720
if we were to um offset 15

589
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,038
of of emissions by 2050 we're going to

590
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,440
need to sequester about or have our

591
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,679
forest sequester about 60 million metric

592
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,840
tons so over double what

593
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,360
they're sequestering today so that's a

594
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,038
tall order uh for our forest

595
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,359
but you know i think

596
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,720
we have some really aggressive

597
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,279
tactics that we're looking to move

598
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,919
forward and you know we're going to to

599
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,399
see how far we can get on to reaching

600
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,400
that goal

601
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,839
so uh

602
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,519
first strategy that i want to talk a

603
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,839
little bit about is keeping foresters

604
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,480
for us

605
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,480
and on the right here we see the current

606
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,960
carbon stores in new york and this is

607
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,038
the info information put out by fia but

608
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
we are also working with

609
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,960
esf

610
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,080
utilizing some satellite imagery

611
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,640
lidar data to try to refine this

612
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,319
um and so we will hopefully in the

613
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,120
coming years have some

614
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,359
uh

615
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,199
more precise tools coming on to tell us

616
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,319
where we're gaining carbon where we're

617
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,000
losing carbon to target some of our work

618
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,359
and so that's really important work

619
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,038
that's going on

620
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,278
but if you look at this area you see

621
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,278
that our highest carbon stores

622
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,880
unsurprisingly are in the adirondacks in

623
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,079
the catskill park

624
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,278
areas the tug hill also has quite a bit

625
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,879
of carbon stored

626
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,558
but you see a lot of opportunity in the

627
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,840
finger lakes region the north country

628
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,558
and

629
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,278
and areas in in the in there um the

630
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,278
hudson valley also seems to have a lot

631
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,159
less carbon stores

632
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,159
definitely probably related to the

633
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,278
um

634
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
to

635
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,319
things like development and things like

636
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:22,158
that in that area

637
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,079
so our strategies um for keeping forces

638
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,320
for us obviously one of the main things

639
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,558
here would be land acquisition so fee

640
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,558
and conservation easements are a really

641
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,158
important part of that so fee ownership

642
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,519
would be purchasing the property

643
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,080
outright

644
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,639
in conservation easements

645
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:42,319
let the land keep the land owned in

646
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,320
private hands but

647
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,440
usually it's the purchasing of

648
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,839
development rights of that property so

649
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,519
it keeps those forests as forests

650
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,000
while allowing for

651
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,599
them to be working lands especially when

652
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,599
talking about the adirondack park

653
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,038
the this strategy would relate to state

654
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,678
acquisitions municipal acquisitions land

655
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,679
trust acquisitions but you know taking

656
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,440
that development pressure away from

657
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
those properties

658
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,798
i we think that you know local

659
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,120
governments are going to be a key part

660
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,798
of this and including

661
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,479
acquisition of really important

662
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,079
properties to them

663
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,558
and their communities in their

664
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,038
comprehensive plans and two new programs

665
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,960
that we've been rolling out at dec this

666
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,879
year are a community forest grant

667
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,558
program which

668
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,120
uh funds

669
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,000
municipalities to purchase community

670
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,678
forests um land that might not fit you

671
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,038
know a state profile for what a state

672
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,440
would purchase but

673
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,200
and keeps the hands the forests and

674
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
local control

675
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
as well as a conservation easement for

676
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,759
land trust program

677
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,840
which is going to help fund

678
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,879
some land trust purchasing more

679
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,879
properties across new york

680
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,519
the next strategy here is um real

681
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
property tax incentives for forest land

682
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,759
owners and this strategy really fits

683
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,079
into both

684
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,240
uh improved forest management as well as

685
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,879
keeping forces for us so i'm going to

686
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,000
kind of talk about it here

687
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,360
but i think it's important to note that

688
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,519
properties that are managed under

689
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:26,240
the current 4ada forest tax law program

690
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,240
are harvest more sustainably than

691
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,759
properties that are not and some studies

692
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,519
have shown that in new york especially

693
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,480
in the watershed the new york city

694
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,278
watershed region as well as better man

695
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,679
bmps occur on those properties as well

696
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,558
but there are definitely incentives tied

697
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,278
to

698
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,200
to a lot of those practices which

699
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,880
encourage good management

700
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,278
and so

701
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,840
our 488 forest tax law program is a

702
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:55,038
program that's been around since the

703
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:57,839
1970s it what came together after

704
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,720
an older program 480

705
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,278
and it's a timber focus program so it's

706
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,839
managing properties for the for

707
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,359
sustainable timber products coming off

708
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,240
that property

709
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,399
parcels have to be at least 50 acres

710
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,679
of forests

711
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,440
and there's penalties in terms of

712
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,278
taking your property out of 48 and so

713
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,240
since this program is older it's not

714
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,119
carbon focused it is really um

715
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,399
a timber production focus we think that

716
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,918
it needs some updates um legislatively

717
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,558
to be amended

718
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,559
and that's something that you know the

719
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:40,960
is the recommendation that came from the

720
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,158
forestry panel with the clcpa um

721
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,038
and

722
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,600
uh to modernize the program uh reduce

723
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,480
that acre threshold possibly to allow

724
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,398
more lenders to take uh ben you know

725
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,200
take advantage of the program currently

726
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,439
only nine percent of um eligible

727
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,319
landowners in new york are are part of

728
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,798
this um but if you try to get out of 4da

729
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,720
they're also very strict penalties so

730
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,639
that's how it really helps people keep

731
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,600
their properties by reducing the burden

732
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
of taxes on them is an 80

733
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,278
reduction in the assessed value of those

734
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,038
properties

735
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,960
but also

736
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,679
uh because those properties will be

737
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,159
benefiting the public and uh creating a

738
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,519
sustained forest product off of them

739
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,760
they're required to have management

740
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,240
plans be managed by a professional

741
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,879
forester and those plans are reviewed by

742
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,798
dec staff

743
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,200
in addition to that program i think the

744
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,038
state has recognized the importance that

745
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
not everyone wants to manage their

746
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,879
properties for timber and that's also

747
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,000
that has a real benefit and so 480b and

748
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,240
480c are two newer programs that uh were

749
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,480
recommended out of the 4c panel that

750
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,120
have smaller acreage requirements for

751
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,440
landowners

752
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,000
and you know timber harvesting is not a

753
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,679
requirement of that property but if done

754
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,480
would have to be done by a professional

755
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,919
forester and and go through the dec

756
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,839
approval process

757
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,159
and so that you know ensures that

758
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,918
sustainable practices are happening on

759
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,960
the property

760
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,480
but also gives people a tax benefit for

761
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,319
holding forest land in new york um

762
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,558
while reducing the tax burden on those

763
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,678
properties um to help people you know

764
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,720
keep those properties um in forests and

765
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,200
keep them

766
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,319
from getting partialized and fragmented

767
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,798
we've seen

768
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,759
over the last number of years

769
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:36,480
a reduction in the average size of

770
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,599
forest land holdings in new york as

771
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,360
properties get continually split up

772
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,918
which limits the potential for those

773
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,879
properties to be managed sustainably

774
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
and

775
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,240
increases development on those

776
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,079
properties

777
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,679
and so you know there's some specifics

778
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,278
here in terms of

779
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,519
how those programs would work and i'd be

780
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,759
glad to talk about it more with folks

781
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,759
but you know they are are relatively

782
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,200
general recommendations but we see a

783
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,200
need to

784
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,880
give the landowners more options to get

785
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,798
more landowners enrolled in these type

786
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,559
of programs so these programs have a

787
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,879
broader impact

788
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:13,519
all the states around new york currently

789
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,919
have tax law programs

790
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,720
they all are similar but also very

791
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,240
different and you know programs like

792
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,038
vermont's use value appraisal program

793
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
have

794
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:29,359
much higher enrollment and you see you

795
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,359
know 60 70 of the four eligible forests

796
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,359
in that those areas

797
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,639
enrolled in those programs so it has

798
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,519
those programs tend to have a broader

799
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,600
scope

800
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,639
they affect more landowners and and can

801
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,839
really

802
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,759
push the

803
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,240
you know good management out onto the

804
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,240
landscape

805
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
and the last

806
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,839
strategy here is regulating forest land

807
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
conversion

808
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,119
and as

809
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,840
we talk about the importance of carbon

810
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,759
stores and combating carbon

811
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,158
and combating climate change and carbon

812
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,119
sequestration we recognize the

813
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,039
importance of forests uh for all new

814
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,079
yorkers for the value that those forests

815
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:12,398
provide and similar to um you know

816
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,798
wetland protection laws which saw the

817
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,239
importance of wetlands um

818
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,359
you know this

819
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,480
would this regulation or keeping forces

820
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,398
forest law um would try to prevent

821
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,759
land um

822
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:30,398
land conversion uh and so

823
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,720
the law would be set up similar to

824
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,158
what a um

825
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
what our wetland law would be which

826
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,559
would look to avoid impacts the forest

827
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
to minimize where possible and then to

828
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,639
mitigate those carbon losses

829
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,240
um

830
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,200
one of the recommendations before she

831
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
panel

832
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,480
talked about was exempting agriculture

833
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,159
from from this as land kind of fluxes

834
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,480
between those two

835
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,880
areas regularly and

836
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,880
agricultural lands would be

837
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,559
still working land

838
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
and the soil would still be intact in

839
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:06,720
those areas so that was an important

840
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
distinction that the panel recommended

841
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,480
participating in carbon markets is a

842
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,360
pretty complicated thing and i can talk

843
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,798
about it more as well but um you know

844
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:21,678
these are ways carbon markets are

845
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,200
uh growing in popularity we see you know

846
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,038
a number of folks starting to get

847
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
involved in them especially if they have

848
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,640
larger land holdings of 2 000 or more

849
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,119
acres

850
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,919
but they do promote good forest

851
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,000
management on those properties through

852
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,720
long-term contracts that are typically

853
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,599
signed by most of these and it's

854
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,159
something that the clc the

855
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,158
that they need to be explored more

856
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,519
to see how we can

857
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,039
and

858
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,159
incentivize good management on the

859
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:51,919
properties

860
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,399
um

861
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,440
in terms of we do not have a mandatory

862
00:32:54,398 --> 00:33:00,239
market in new york and that's something

863
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,600
that that hasn't been set up yet um as

864
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,798
the clcta puts quite a bit of

865
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,119
um

866
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,278
strict regulations on

867
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:12,319
those on how that would be set up in

868
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:14,240
terms of offsets needing to be within 25

869
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,960
miles i think it is of

870
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,519
of an emission source so

871
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,440
that would make it quite challenging to

872
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,359
put something like that together

873
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,919
because a lot of the mission sources you

874
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,000
know don't have available uh mitigation

875
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,880
areas close to

876
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
um

877
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
to those source areas

878
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,679
all right so the next strategy that i

879
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,600
want to talk about here is improved

880
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,640
forest management so

881
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,719
the importance of um

882
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,159
of increasing the carbon stocks in our

883
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,640
current forests

884
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,039
and uh the i talked about a little bit

885
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,799
earlier but forest pests play a huge

886
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,200
role in your forest

887
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,000
and and the carbon stocks there we've

888
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,558
seen

889
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,319
emerald ash borer especially and hemlock

890
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,240
willie aldridge having

891
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,759
impact on our forest

892
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,399
across new york

893
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,960
as we we lose those species

894
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,519
from the landscape

895
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,599
and so these forest pests can reduce

896
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,838
productivity increase mortality on the

897
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,559
landscape and there's an increased need

898
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,799
for prevention rapid response i'm going

899
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,759
to talk a little bit about later about

900
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,639
some resources that folks can

901
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,599
can

902
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,519
get to

903
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,519
with that and dec has a bureau of

904
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,679
invasive species management that that

905
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:33,759
can help folks with management of their

906
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,800
forests and combat invasive species

907
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,200
the next

908
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,519
is improved silviculture and restoration

909
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,678
of degraded stands and

910
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,199
you know i think it's important that we

911
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,200
facilitate good management on our

912
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,878
properties and reduce and eliminate high

913
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,319
grading

914
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,799
in those forests so we don't have those

915
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,800
degraded stands and under stock stands

916
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
um taking the best and leaving the rest

917
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,720
is a practice that

918
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,118
has been documented in new york it

919
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,598
reduces genetic

920
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,680
quality of trees in the area and the

921
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,440
capacity of those forced to recover and

922
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,960
tim talked a little bit about how to

923
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
deal with those stands unfortunately we

924
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,559
don't have very good low-grade markets

925
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,838
to deal with a lot of these degraded

926
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,599
stands so

927
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,440
we're going to need real incentives to

928
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,838
help landowners have the tools they need

929
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,240
to restore these stands

930
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,159
obviously outreach to landowners

931
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,679
carb specific carbon training for

932
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,679
foresters and incentives to to help

933
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,399
landowners

934
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,399
restore impacted stands

935
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,440
one of the big issues in new york and

936
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,358
the

937
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,240
the map here on the right talks about

938
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,719
regeneration issues in new york and dr

939
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:44,239
and over browsing by deer are is a huge

940
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:46,159
issue in new york in terms of forestry

941
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,239
the important thing to look at with this

942
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,039
map is anything that's red orange or

943
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,759
yellow is considered insecure areas in

944
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,679
terms of regeneration so if you lose a

945
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,040
force in that area due to

946
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,799
invasive species a wind disturbance

947
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,239
or a harvest

948
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
those are areas that you cannot

949
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,679
guarantee that you're going to get that

950
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,679
forest coming back

951
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,519
naturally or very quickly and so you

952
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,519
could have continuation of some like

953
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,199
shrublands which have a limited

954
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,639
potential for sequestration and

955
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,399
regeneration

956
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,440
there are a few areas in new york that

957
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,838
have secure generation regeneration but

958
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,400
those areas are few and far between

959
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,920
this work was done by tnc and

960
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,280
you know i can provide some some of

961
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,680
those links for folks if they're

962
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,240
interested

963
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:34,639
a really big strategy here is terms of a

964
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,000
forestation reforestation so combating

965
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,639
the loss of forests we're really going

966
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,280
to need to plant new trees um in areas

967
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,000
identify and prioritize areas that need

968
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,440
new trees and um

969
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,358
and try to

970
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,240
to reforest our our our landscape

971
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,639
so

972
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,598
the work the map here on the right is

973
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,759
work done by tnc again

974
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,760
on the reforestation hub

975
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,960
there's some really interesting work

976
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,680
here on availability of land for

977
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,079
reforestation

978
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,319
i think it's kind of important to if you

979
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,839
think back to our carbon stock snap that

980
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,000
we were putting up is that

981
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,759
the areas that have the lowest carbon

982
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,358
stock seem to have the most area

983
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,119
available for reforestation so the

984
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,639
adirondacks and the catskills don't have

985
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,240
a lot of area that we're going to be

986
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,559
able to reforest but you know your

987
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,879
finger lakes region um your north

988
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,279
country are areas where we can really

989
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,160
make an impact this strategy

990
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,160
um tnc

991
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,799
estimated close to four million acres

992
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,920
might be available for reforestation i

993
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,079
think actual um acreage is going to be a

994
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,200
bit lower than that and you know maybe

995
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,880
in the 1 million to 2 million range in

996
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,639
terms of you know what people are

997
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,559
willing and want forests on their

998
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,239
property

999
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,799
what areas

1000
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,719
are being used for pasture and for

1001
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,880
agricultural purposes so where we're

1002
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,358
going to be able to put that those trees

1003
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
and i think there's also an important

1004
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,039
crossroads here

1005
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,640
in terms of the conflict with renewable

1006
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:11,838
energy so a lot of the areas that are

1007
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,759
good locations for solar siting are also

1008
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,960
good locations for planting so you know

1009
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,400
there's going to be a need to prioritize

1010
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,320
both of those actions and so um

1011
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,599
and so we're gonna have to put solar out

1012
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,079
in the landscape we're gonna have to put

1013
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,559
forests on the landscape and

1014
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,160
um gonna need to make sure that those

1015
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,320
two are not in conflict with each other

1016
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,480
and we're doing both of them

1017
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,079
simultaneously

1018
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,838
the other thing that we're going to work

1019
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,280
on is reforesting our under stock stands

1020
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,719
and so that's going to be a really

1021
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,400
important part of this process as well

1022
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,919
i'm just going to talk really briefly

1023
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,680
about urban forestry urban forestry is

1024
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,320
a really important part of our carbon

1025
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,199
stocks than that it um those trees in

1026
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,480
urban settings sequester carbon

1027
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,480
they also

1028
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,880
reduce energy costs

1029
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,639
and of our homes

1030
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,400
and so they they have that

1031
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,319
multiple effect

1032
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,960
in terms of climate change and so

1033
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,280
increasing uh tree canopies in our urban

1034
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,599
areas is going to be really important

1035
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,480
the dec currently has grant programs for

1036
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,400
communities that we put out regularly in

1037
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,760
this space and you know we're going to

1038
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,440
need to really

1039
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,720
ramp those programs up if we're going to

1040
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,480
make an impact in that area

1041
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,959
we have you know generally seen a

1042
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,599
decrease in our urban forest over the

1043
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,838
the last number of years um and you know

1044
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,039
i can just tell you from my community as

1045
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:41,519
we have increased wind storms um we i

1046
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,119
see trees come down um then i hear

1047
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,719
chainsaws going as everyone starts

1048
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,680
taking some more trees down and very

1049
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,759
rarely do i see folks replant big trees

1050
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,679
um sometimes i'll see small trees but

1051
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,280
you know i see very few big trees being

1052
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,639
replanted in our communities and that's

1053
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,480
something that you know we're going to

1054
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,480
need to work on reversing that trend

1055
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,000
and bioeconomy is also really important

1056
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
so this

1057
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
use of durable wood products

1058
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,318
supporting our forest industry and the

1059
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,480
creation of those can be essential if

1060
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,800
we're going to you know continue having

1061
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,719
good management on our landscape

1062
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,480
um also you know these lumber products

1063
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,239
are sequestering or you know have

1064
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,760
sequestered carbon um while the you know

1065
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,479
substitute products they have like

1066
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,119
concrete or steel you know uh take quite

1067
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,679
a bit of carbon to create and so you

1068
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,079
know there's a real a lot to be gained

1069
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,239
by using these products and there are

1070
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,480
definitely a lot of hurdles in terms of

1071
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,399
the construction industry

1072
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,639
what they are used to using standard

1073
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,720
practices and getting these practices

1074
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,039
out in the landscape i think mass timber

1075
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,480
it has a real potential to make a big

1076
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,199
impact if we can

1077
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,599
get more adoption from

1078
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,480
developers when making properties when

1079
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,480
making buildings

1080
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,159
so the last section of my talk today i

1081
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,318
just want to talk about some

1082
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,159
opportunities that landowners have a lot

1083
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,079
of these

1084
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,078
programs have been running long-standing

1085
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,760
programs but we have some new programs

1086
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,760
at dec

1087
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,960
that can help landowners

1088
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,960
manage their properties

1089
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,318
you know there's a lot of things that

1090
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,680
we've recommended in the clcpa to help

1091
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,838
improve

1092
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:29,199
forest management on the landscape

1093
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:31,358
and a lot of those haven't been

1094
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,399
implemented yet so there's a lot to be

1095
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,679
gained

1096
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,160
you know a lot of things that hopefully

1097
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,759
will be coming down the line um but this

1098
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,960
is you know kind of what's available

1099
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,960
right now and so i'm going to run

1100
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,318
through a couple dec programs and touch

1101
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
briefly on

1102
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,960
the natural resource conservation

1103
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,639
services program which is uh

1104
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,960
the environmental quality incentives

1105
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,199
program equip it's it's quite a long

1106
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,960
name but um

1107
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,960
you know that has is a long-standing

1108
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,559
program um that

1109
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,639
you know helps people do improved force

1110
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:04,239
management on the property so

1111
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,519
um equip has a forced stand improvement

1112
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,279
practice

1113
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,000
which helps people you know improve the

1114
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,319
sustained forced health and productivity

1115
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,079
and one of the newer

1116
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,960
practices that they're allowing here is

1117
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,960
increase or maintain carbon storage

1118
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,960
in their forests is another

1119
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,199
practice and so

1120
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,880
you need to talk with a professional

1121
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,598
forester if you want to get involved in

1122
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,519
these programs or your local nrcs office

1123
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,519
this is a grant program and i i

1124
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,880
apologize i'm not sure when they they

1125
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,759
open up their program but um

1126
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,519
it's

1127
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,200
it's also cost share so i think

1128
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,440
landowners do have to

1129
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,838
do some contributing to this kind of a

1130
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,838
program

1131
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,959
our dc's for stewardship program is

1132
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:53,358
long-standing it connects to landowners

1133
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,960
across the landscape with professional

1134
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,598
forestry advice

1135
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,838
and management advice dec land or forest

1136
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,760
staff will go out and walk the land with

1137
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:03,358
the landowner and work on

1138
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,599
either putting together a paper

1139
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,279
management plan for them or giving them

1140
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,559
some technical assistance and basic

1141
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,560
guidance

1142
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,559
based on availability of our staff

1143
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,440
unfortunately in reduction in the amount

1144
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,920
of staff that we have to do this

1145
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,318
you know we don't do a full inventory

1146
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,559
and stuff that a consulting forester

1147
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,838
would do and so after you know

1148
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,279
connecting with the land owner and

1149
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,559
finding out what their goals for

1150
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,440
management are and what they're looking

1151
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,000
to do we often refer them to a

1152
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,800
cooperating forester private consultant

1153
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,239
who works on a fee basis with them

1154
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,079
for a lot of what they want to do if

1155
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,838
you're looking to do a timber harvest we

1156
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,240
always recommend working with a

1157
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,920
consulting forester

1158
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,679
to get the best outcome that you're

1159
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,680
looking for on that harvest

1160
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,560
our 4da program as i talked about a

1161
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,480
little bit earlier needs to be

1162
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,159
updated but it is still a really

1163
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,039
beneficial program

1164
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:02,000
it provides an 80 reduction in the

1165
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,920
assessed that value of forest land that

1166
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
someone owns that's committed to this

1167
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,838
program it's a rolling 10-year

1168
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,318
commitment and so every year that you

1169
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,159
get the benefit you are

1170
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:14,880
enrolled for another 10 years out from

1171
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,399
that and has put the lien on the deed

1172
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,318
and so it really is sort of like a con

1173
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,599
temporary conservation easement on those

1174
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,119
properties

1175
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,880
but it also you know connects those

1176
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,200
landowners with the tools that they need

1177
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,838
to properly manage their properties

1178
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,118
through professional forester force

1179
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,239
and

1180
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,079
and dec oversight in terms of reviewing

1181
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,838
those management plans and prescriptions

1182
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,839
for those harvests

1183
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,838
but the big crux here is that landowners

1184
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,719
have to have at least 50 acres to commit

1185
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,559
and you know there are a lot of

1186
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,559
requirements of the program so it's

1187
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,159
really important that landowners know

1188
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,239
what they're getting into when they sign

1189
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,838
up for this kind of a program

1190
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,239
but you know only nine percent of new

1191
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,279
york forests are enrolled in this um

1192
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,519
so it's

1193
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,000
really a small percentage of new york

1194
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,920
forests and so we need to really expand

1195
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,039
this in order to

1196
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,880
make a big impact out on the landscape

1197
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,599
just a few other programs we run our

1198
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,200
trees for trips programs buffer in a bag

1199
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,160
through the saratoga tree nursery

1200
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,519
provides

1201
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,118
trees for land

1202
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,838
for landowners who are looking to

1203
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,838
reforest

1204
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,039
reforest riparian areas our saratoga

1205
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:26,318
tree nursery does sealing sales each

1206
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,800
year and sells

1207
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,318
pretty cheap ceilings to folks across

1208
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,160
new york

1209
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,279
and our urban forestry grant program is

1210
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,719
available to municipalities and um and

1211
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,680
non-profits

1212
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,318
uh to either get urban management plans

1213
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,639
do tree planting um

1214
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,318
work and and things like that so really

1215
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,679
is working in that space and i think

1216
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,039
that the newest

1217
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,919
round of that grant is going to be

1218
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,920
released sometime in 2022.

1219
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,639
and then i just want to talk briefly

1220
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,480
about our newest program that where we

1221
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,318
started we just finished our first round

1222
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,318
in new york which is regenerate new york

1223
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,559
which is really you know targeting some

1224
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,599
of this climate work

1225
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,880
and

1226
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,599
um

1227
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,720
we had a few out four eligible practices

1228
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,800
here a4 station reforestation stand

1229
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,358
restoration competing controlling

1230
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,039
competing vegetation and deer enclosures

1231
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,039
and this is a

1232
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,679
um

1233
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,880
the round one had about 450 000 dollars

1234
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:31,199
that we allocated to landowners between

1235
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,160
that at least three thousand to fifty

1236
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:37,519
thousand dollars um

1237
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,118
in money for that there was a 25 percent

1238
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,318
match for landowners so they had to

1239
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,160
match some of the work that was

1240
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,639
happening out there but it you know

1241
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,719
helps get some some of this work out in

1242
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,960
the landscape and get it started you

1243
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:52,559
know unfortunately when thinking about

1244
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,199
the impact of this program that 450 000

1245
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,480
got us about 500 acres of impacted sites

1246
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,118
so we're going to

1247
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,199
if we want to reforest a million acres

1248
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,880
you know this might not be the easiest

1249
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,318
way to do it is getting a lot of that

1250
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,358
work done we're going to really need to

1251
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,358
ramp up what we're doing

1252
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,240
and then i

1253
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,400
really briefly talked about invasive

1254
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,719
species i mentioned we have a bureau of

1255
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,639
invasive species and ecosystem health in

1256
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,159
dec

1257
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,920
and

1258
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,159
we've got folks out there surveying for

1259
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,318
invasive species we do really rely on

1260
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,719
citizen scientists and i just wanted to

1261
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,800
mention here imap invasives is a great

1262
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,358
resource for folks if you don't know

1263
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,119
about it it's a way to report invasive

1264
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,358
species that you see

1265
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,358
all your submissions will be reviewed so

1266
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,519
if you're not sure what it is you can

1267
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,358
still put it in and a dec staff member

1268
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,480
is going to look at it and confirm or

1269
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,078
deny

1270
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,920
what you see out there and so that's a

1271
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,160
great resource for folks to connect them

1272
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,720
with some technical experts

1273
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:54,159
our forest health email is also a way to

1274
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,519
email pictures and questions and

1275
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:57,279
there are local

1276
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,519
partnerships for regional invasive

1277
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,680
species management or prisms

1278
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,519
that are grassroots networks for

1279
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,759
managing invasive species across new

1280
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,400
york that dec funds

1281
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,160
and our local experts at some of the

1282
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,838
invasive species in your area so if

1283
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,000
you've got invasive species questions

1284
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,920
there are a lot of resources out there

1285
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,440
for you

1286
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,119
and

1287
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,400
dec is here to help as well as our

1288
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,760
partners

1289
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,760
that is all that i had today

1290
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,199
that was fantastic brian thank you so

1291
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,519
much

1292
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:33,480
peter will field some questions and i

1293
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,480
will set out a poll

1294
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:40,880
yes thanks very much brian and and

1295
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,479
thanks back to tim also for a lot of

1296
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,079
great information

1297
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,519
we have a question

1298
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,559
uh

1299
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,920
please discuss how the clcpa limits

1300
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,920
offset possibilities

1301
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,318
yeah so i mentioned this briefly and i'm

1302
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,720
not an expert in the offset

1303
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,199
field but in terms of

1304
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,199
i know that the clcpa in terms of its

1305
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,199
mandatory if you were to set up a

1306
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,239
mandatory market where folks are able to

1307
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,039
offset

1308
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,719
um it limits the distance that those

1309
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,318
offsets could be

1310
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:15,199
placed from

1311
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,759
um

1312
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,960
from where that emission source is

1313
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
and so

1314
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,720
you know that's a

1315
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,799
important part of it i think also it's

1316
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,879
important to note that in terms of you

1317
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,839
know statewide sequestration and carbon

1318
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,640
neutrality goal by 2050

1319
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,799
we're not looking at offsets it's more

1320
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,719
the total sequestration

1321
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,640
rate for new york forest

1322
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,879
and so that's an important distinction

1323
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,879
there

1324
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,838
great thanks

1325
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,838
another question

1326
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,920
has the department of lands and forests

1327
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,280
consulted with the department of ag and

1328
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,159
markets on goals for aforestation

1329
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:00,079
or reforestation of agricultural areas

1330
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,078
are there a specific strategies

1331
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:08,799
so this is a great um outcome from the

1332
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,358
uh 4g panel as it was um

1333
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,599
it was working directly with ag markets

1334
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,759
on this and so you know we we've

1335
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,000
collaborated quite a bit in terms of

1336
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,040
that we haven't we're still working on

1337
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,559
creating prioritization of areas um but

1338
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,079
you know and i think some of the work

1339
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,720
that's been done by

1340
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,800
private groups on tnc for example you

1341
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,239
know trying to identify those marginal

1342
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,000
lands that are not currently in

1343
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:36,479
agricultural production that would be um

1344
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,838
ideal for creating forests and we have

1345
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,159
definitely worked with

1346
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:44,000
um worked with agon markets and and will

1347
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,000
continue to especially with their soil

1348
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,760
and water conservation districts with uh

1349
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,358
which are um

1350
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,559
really have a lot of on the ground

1351
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:54,639
knowledge on in this area

1352
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,800
great thanks so much

1353
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,799
uh here's another question what is the

1354
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,200
status of 480b and 480c

1355
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,760
are they enacted where can we get more

1356
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:05,759
information

1357
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:11,440
um so those were recommended by the

1358
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,879
forestry panel 480b and 4dc they are not

1359
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
enacted they

1360
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,240
um

1361
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:22,000
i will say here in terms of um the clcpa

1362
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,838
and you know our climate work is that

1363
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,760
the scoping plan which i mentioned

1364
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,599
earlier is

1365
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,280
being developed and will be released for

1366
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,838
public comment in

1367
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,680
2022

1368
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:38,400
so in january of 2022 in just a few days

1369
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,639
and so the recommendations um that came

1370
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,920
out of the forest panels work

1371
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,679
are in there

1372
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,440
those are two recommendations that were

1373
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,399
created in there

1374
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,720
they are not enacted they are just

1375
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,800
currently recommendations the the plan

1376
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,199
will be available for public comment all

1377
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,200
of next year um and you know we look for

1378
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:00,318
the legislature to be to move on those

1379
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:02,239
if it's something that they prioritize

1380
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,440
thanks and here's

1381
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:08,719
another question about the clcpa

1382
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,880
does the clcpa or any current proposed

1383
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,439
legislation take deer management and

1384
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,920
deer impact on forest regeneration into

1385
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,920
account

1386
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,920
um in the recommendations we do talk

1387
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,880
about fear management and regeneration

1388
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,838
issues

1389
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,280
um

1390
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:29,119
though

1391
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,839
you know i would say that um

1392
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,960
it is is not a prime focus i think some

1393
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:35,358
of the work that we've done to

1394
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,079
regenerate new york um

1395
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:40,318
talks about more about excluding beer

1396
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,960
from regeneration areas through fencing

1397
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:45,920
practices and things like that um

1398
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,400
and and does not directly talk about

1399
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,880
reducing populations of herds across new

1400
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,880
york state

1401
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,159
okay

1402
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,879
another question since new york state

1403
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:01,440
does not have a licensure program for

1404
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,680
foresters how will the state bring in

1405
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,559
loggers or other folks that do not have

1406
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:10,480
training into plans to improve silver

1407
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,480
culture for carbon sequestration

1408
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,200
that's an important point

1409
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,759
that we don't have a licensing program

1410
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:20,480
for forest foresters across new york

1411
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,920
what we do have is the long-standing

1412
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,760
cooperating forester program at dec so

1413
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,720
folks that

1414
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:31,680
are on that list are our folks that

1415
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,759
cooperate with dec they have a set of

1416
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,000
wrecks of requirements in terms of

1417
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,079
education to have that and we're working

1418
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,838
on um

1419
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,400
getting training directly to those

1420
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,480
members as well as you know

1421
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,960
the the forestry professionals in

1422
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,240
general in this area um you know that's

1423
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,880
something that

1424
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:53,039
some local recent grants have to have

1425
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,000
started and we're hoping to roll out in

1426
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,759
the next few years

1427
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,318
so here's a question i think you've

1428
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,319
partially answered this but clearly it's

1429
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,440
on people's minds is there an

1430
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:07,358
anticipated timeline for implementation

1431
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,559
of legislative opportunities for

1432
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,558
landowners under the clcpa

1433
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,119
so the

1434
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,318
in terms of the plan the plan the

1435
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,318
scoping plan will be

1436
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,399
you know out for public comment

1437
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,520
all

1438
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,240
you know for a period of time next year

1439
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,759
um i'm not sure exactly at the timeline

1440
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,479
that that's going to be out i think it

1441
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,079
will be you know 120 160 day comment

1442
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,039
period

1443
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,240
and the

1444
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:42,798
plan is to finalize that by 2023

1445
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,798
and so then you know we would hope that

1446
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,199
the implementation of those

1447
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,920
recommendations would come soon after

1448
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,480
that

1449
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,838
um you know i think dec has a lot of

1450
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,838
programs in this area which i

1451
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,759
highlighted as well and you know we're

1452
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,440
already you know moving forward and

1453
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,960
trying to integrate carbon management

1454
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,039
into those programs as quickly as

1455
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,760
possible so what we're able to do

1456
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:06,079
without legislative approval um we're

1457
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,000
moving forward with within our dec

1458
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,960
programs currently

1459
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,960
well thanks brian
