1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,958
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,120
University okay so hi everyone my name

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,519
is Elise tomaseski I'm really excited to

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,559
talk about my research where I've been

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,719
using chrisper cast 9 to Target fruit

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,599
obis related genes in filis graa and

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,320
I'll also go over an unexpected path

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,519
that my research has taken over the last

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,599
couple of years so fisus graa or ground

10
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,038
cherry is my model species it's a

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,320
species that I work on it is a solonus

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,719
fruit crop species and it produces small

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,359
sweet yellow berries however it is an

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,840
underutilized species that's not grown

15
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,119
on a large scale largely because it is a

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,960
semi-domesticated species as it has a

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,599
sprawling growth habit and high rates of

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,000
fruit drop PR the name ground

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
cherry the fruit are covered by an

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,480
inflated caix or a husk and the husk the

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,280
color does not always corate with the

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,078
ripeness of the fruit so on the left are

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,399
fruit that had dropped and I peeled back

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,359
the Kos all of these and there are a

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,920
there is a clear gradient of ripeness in

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,118
the fruit so even though they have

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,640
dropped they are not always rip not only

28
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,640
is that an issue but the fruit drop is

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
an issue because you can then introduce

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
soil born pests or pathogens to the

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,840
fruit and making them unsellable and

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,040
Farmers would lose and profit that

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,400
way therefore for my research I am using

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,840
frisper cast 9 and fistus graa as my

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,680
model species to explore the genetics

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,478
behind fruit exision as well as trying

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,439
to develop ground cherry lines with

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,280
reduced fruit drop

39
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,078
there are four main steps of fruit

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
excision or fruit drop however the

41
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,000
genetics behind each step is largely

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,280
unknown these four steps include the

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,560
formation of an obis Zone which are

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,359
small cytoplasmically dense cells this

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,118
is where the Detachment occurs and it

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,799
forms on the pedestal that connects the

47
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,799
fruit to the plate these obyan Zone

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,118
cells then become competent to external

49
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,680
signals that induce cell separation and

50
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,879
then CIS cence and Detachment occurs for

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,920
my research though I am interested in

52
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,879
aing the genetics behind the obis Zone

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,478
formation and how that

54
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:09,399
occurs a likely group of genes for me to

55
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,439
Target were Mbox transcription facets

56
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,479
these are largely known to upregulate or

57
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,280
induce floral organ development and

58
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,318
they're also known to work in groups of

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,840
four or a

60
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,799
Teter in tomato which I'm kind of

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
illustrating on the left here there are

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,959
three known Mbox transcription factors

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,878
that induce obis Zone development these

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
include jointless and what I'm showing

65
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,199
is a wild type pedestal on the top and a

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,920
jointless mutant pedestal on the bottom

67
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,399
there is no obis Zone this is also the

68
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:43,039
same for mutants of ma P where MC as my

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,920
diagram shows and jointless 2 however

70
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,120
interestingly the jointless 2 orthologue

71
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,439
does not exist in fesal fora and I'll

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
talk about that more at the end of my

73
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,239
presentation but for my work I'm using

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,878
crisper cast 9 to Target the orthologue

75
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,759
of ma cix which is npf3 and the

76
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,840
orthologue of jointless which is also

77
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,840
named jointless and I hypothesize that

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,120
That Knocking out these genes would also

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,799
inhibit or not have an exision Zone form

80
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,680
on the pedesto and that is exactly what

81
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,439
I found so on the left is a wild type BR

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,200
cherry fruit and zooming in it's very

83
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,400
clear where this exision zone is present

84
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,039
this is where the ccent stops on the

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,158
pedestal this is where the fruit will

86
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,158
detach however in my mutant in the

87
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,878
middle here this subcision Zone does not

88
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,439
exist it's not present by the naked eye

89
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,840
in fact these fruit will continue to

90
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,799
stay on the plant and actually Decay or

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,840
uh continue to ripen until a physical

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,438
force is applied however I do want to

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,920
note that it's not impossible to pull

94
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,318
these fruit off it's not harming the

95
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,039
plant like it would in a Pepper or a

96
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,039
golden

97
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,280
Berry similarly to my jointless mutants

98
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,400
my npf3 mutants also do not form an

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,360
exision Zone shown in the middle picture

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,719
here as

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,120
well another phenotype that I'm seeing

102
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,158
on these npf3 mutants only is that the

103
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,039
Kix does not coales to a single point uh

104
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,519
as it does in the wild headp you can

105
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,120
also see the berry in there it's

106
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,519
completely yellow so it's already ripen

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,680
which is a great phenotype that I like

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
to see and it's helping with the

109
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,360
uniformity of

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
ripening so just because I couldn't see

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,079
the Obion Zone by ey doesn't mean that

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,959
it didn't form and I wanted to see on a

113
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,239
microscopic level if the Obion Zone was

114
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,040
forming so what I did was I chose fruit

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,840
that the cix or the fruit was starting

116
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,400
to ripen I embedded those in parin wax

117
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,478
and sectioned those and what I saw was

118
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,439
an Obion Zone in my wild PPE so on the

119
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,519
very left what you can how to orient

120
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,360
yourself is that on the left would be

121
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,758
the pedestal connecting to the plant and

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
towards to the right would be connecting

123
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,919
to the fruit there is a clear zone of

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
obsidion Zone cells they're small and

125
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,399
Darkly stained however in my jointless

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,319
Mutant shown in the middle here this

127
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,198
Obion zone is not present I don't see

128
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,639
these small banding SS similarly in my

129
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,639
mpf 3 mutant this also doesn't exist

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,560
this is exactly what I wanted to

131
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,720
see zooming out we on a larger scale

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,519
this is also important both not only in

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
a large scale agricultural setting but

134
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,799
in the greenhouse so I grew up wild type

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,360
plants and my Mutant both jointless npf3

136
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,400
and these are going at the same time

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,160
everything's the same and you can see

138
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,839
there large accumulation of fruit

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,960
occurring on the the rakes that hold up

140
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,319
the pl not only does this cause more

141
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,560
time for me as a researcher to have to

142
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,879
go and clean my green houses but you're

143
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,120
increasing pressure of both diseases and

144
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,279
pests in the greenhouse similarly as

145
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,840
I've already stated on a large scale

146
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,239
this would be bad because You' be losing

147
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,839
profit due to fruit that are on the

148
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,918
ground so my mutants are holding up and

149
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,519
they're dropping maybe one or two fruit

150
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,959
likely because you're jumping into the

151
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,399
at that

152
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,758
point up until this point you guys have

153
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,959
kindly assumed that I have created

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,520
Knockouts however the last couple of

155
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,159
years I've had a lot of issues detecting

156
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,159
what edits I've made using crisper cast

157
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,000
I couldn't produce an amplion using PCR

158
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,199
despite many different methods and uh

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,519
attempts and what looking further I

160
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,639
found that my region is Rich in tandem

161
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,680
at repeats which makes PCR an awful

162
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,639
nightmare so I found a PCR protocol from

163
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,319
daughter wall and colleagues where they

164
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759
use a two-step PCR method and they lower

165
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,360
the EXT extension temperature and

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,479
increase the amount of begging inpl

167
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,240
typically an extension temperature of 72

168
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,279
degrees is used and I couldn't get an

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,240
amplion shown by this gel here so when I

170
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,478
lower the extension temperature to 68

171
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,360
degrees I was able to get an amplion so

172
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:23,680
using that method and my optimized

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,680
protocol I finally got bands which I was

174
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,800
really excited for so it's clear the the

175
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,639
band on the very right is my wild type

176
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,319
and all of my meals are evidence of

177
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,038
deletions in the gene itself this re

178
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,120
jointless by the way however this was

179
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,759
also concerning to me because fos graa

180
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,959
is reported to be a diploid so at

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,038
maximum I should be getting two edited

182
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,918
alals and I'm seeing three bands in most

183
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,318
of my examples here this indicated to me

184
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:52,000
that these weren't actually diploid so I

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,000
had to figure this out and I did this

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,959
with two ways first with a pollen

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,918
germination screen that was adapted from

188
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,000
the Litman lab where they found that

189
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,719
diploid plants had one pollen tube per

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,680
pollen grain however non diploids would

191
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,160
have a mixture of two pollen tubes per

192
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,038
pollen grin what I'm showing on the left

193
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,160
here the picture of my wild type fist

194
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,878
grusa pollen and thankfully for me these

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,599
all have one pollen two per pollen grain

196
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,240
meaning that my stock is in fact

197
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:22,079
Diffy what I'm showing now are pictures

198
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,199
of my mutants from jointless so the top

199
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,839
two here they have these two pollen

200
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,038
tubes for pollen grain as well as this

201
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,279
bottom left one here indicating to me

202
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:33,360
that they're not diff also interestingly

203
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,519
my non-transformed control or my wild

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,400
type that went through regeneration also

205
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,799
had two pollen tubes for poll grade this

206
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:41,079
is actually good for me because now I

207
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,240
have a tetrol wild type that I can use

208
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,158
for

209
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,038
comparison I kind of already spoiled it

210
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,519
a little bit but I then needed to use

211
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,240
flow cytometry to kind of figure out

212
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,639
what was going on if I had an anupy A

213
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,000
hexaploid or a tetrol so I was using

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,960
Leaf tissue with the help of Lena Wilson

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,519
and essentially what you can do with uh

216
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,318
flow cytometry is estimate your Tetra or

217
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,198
your Ploy level based on the Nuclear

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,680
fluoresence So essentially a diploid

219
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,560
would have half the amount of

220
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,038
fluorescence as a tetr and this would be

221
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,720
shown by an increase on the x-axis so on

222
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,318
the left you have a diploid Peak at 50

223
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,879
and on the right we have a tou Peak at

224
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,360
100 for my samples this is exactly what

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,759
I saw so my on the left is my wild type

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
and I had a fluoresence level of 10,000

227
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
but my non-transformed control or the

228
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,799
Tetra wild type that I expected was at

229
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,278
20,000 doubling the fluoresence peak

230
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
indicating to me that it was a toucher

231
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,879
point this was also the case for my

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,680
jointless plants as well as my npf3

233
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,719
plant so before I go on to what's next I

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,399
also sympathize greatly with those who

235
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,680
work with poly deoy plants has been a

236
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,159
lot of work but I still have a lot more

237
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,319
to go um I'm planning I'm do in the

238
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,120
process of trying to identify other Mbox

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,360
transcription factors that interact with

240
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,159
jointless and npf3 seeing what might

241
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,919
have taken the place of joint list too I

242
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,120
then will once I get candidates I plan

243
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,120
to Target them using crisper and also

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,959
screen those for any obis Zone

245
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,639
prototypes and with that I'd like to

246
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,000
thank all of our committee members all

247
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,759
of the members from the van G Bon Labs

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,278
as well as the bti greenhouse staff for

249
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,360
keeping my plants healthy and happy uh

250
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,360
the flow citometry team especially Lena

251
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,800
Wilson and Jackie Mahoney as well as the

252
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,519
Litman lab members Sergey and MAA from

253
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,919
BCI for their help with the microscopy

254
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,278
work as well as Victoria and tisar who

255
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,479
were my Ru students Joseph Hill who

256
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,639
helped a lot with the PCR

257
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
troubleshooting and last but not least

258
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,519
Nathan re who was a former member of the

259
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,519
B Club who helped with the jointless

260
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,759
crisper construct design as well as

261
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,480
generating the mpf 3s and with that I'm

262
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,480
happy to take any

263
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:49,039
questions

264
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,120
yes very nice uh is it easier to look at

265
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,000
col to look at like group tips for or I

266
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,919
was also considering doing that um I

267
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,360
because the pro the protocol for bplus

268
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,519
in the pollen had already been figured

269
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,480
out it was a three hour protocol for me

270
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,078
so I could collect pollen germinate it

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,039
and then I was looking in the microscope

272
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,559
pretty like four three to four hours

273
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,319
later so it worked well for me I could

274
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,958
use the root tip

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,959
squash about three hours yeah three to

276
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,200
four yeah I don't want to be this person

277
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,320
here but we'll

278
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,600
see um so

279
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,639
while he's doing that I promise they do

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,839
um I what really started this off for me

281
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,919
was I was in the greenhouse and I

282
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,320
noticed that my flowers were incredibly

283
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,519
large I thought I was kind of going

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,200
crazy for a second there but the flowers

285
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,959
are very large and if he's able to get

286
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,560
this up I'll show you the other thing I

287
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,439
noticed in the flowers themselves was

288
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:52,199
deeper anti in pigmentation um but

289
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,240
you'll also have larger leaves they're a

290
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,800
lot Greener so I can pretty easily

291
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,320
detect a teslo versus a diploid in

292
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,039
my if it ever comes back you'll be able

293
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,639
to see it there we go so not only are

294
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,919
they larger but they're also more

295
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,079
pigmented um both in the petals and the

296
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,479
filaments I this isn't necessarily a

297
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:12,039
phenotype I think this is a jointless

298
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,039
phenotype but yeah I'm just showing the

299
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,919
darker pigmentation here and in the fils

300
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,919
you have an pigmentation

301
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,439
like we don't really have any other this

302
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,839
gr or ground cherry accessions that I

303
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,560
could screen I mean we've screened the

304
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,800
wild Ty for that that we have and it's

305
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,119
deploy um our goldenberry which is also

306
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,838
a fist L is a petri Floy that we know

307
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,959
and that people have reported on a

308
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,760
lature um but I've screen I have created

309
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,000
other knockout lines that I'm not

310
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,879
showing today I think three of them

311
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,399
almost all of them were touch employees

312
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,278
as well I know other people in the lab

313
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,278
have generated them as well and it's

314
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,360
about 80% you'll get that are touch or

315
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,639
touch the high

316
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,839
in I'll keep the ball moving here so

317
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,039
thank you hello everyone good afternoon

318
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,399
um as you said my name is Ain I'm a

319
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,958
third year PhD student in Mike G's lab

320
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
um and I'm excited to talk with you all

321
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:23,559
today about integration of different

322
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,920
proximal remote sensors for uh improved

323
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:29,319
characterization of ergonomically

324
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,838
important traits such as yield

325
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,959
so proximal remote sensors have

326
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,079
applications to both

327
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,278
highy and breeding programs and by

328
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,039
researchers for other projects as well

329
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,879
as Precision

330
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:47,120
agriculture so traditional phenotyping

331
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,639
methods are typically time and labor

332
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,320
intensive um and can be temporarily

333
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,320
constrained um high thut phenotyping on

334
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,560
the other hand may allow things like uh

335
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,760
early season prediction of end of season

336
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:05,359
traits um thereby uh decreasing the time

337
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,559
breeding cycle um can help with

338
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,720
phenotyping more individuals for uh Goos

339
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,399
or training populations for genomic

340
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,879
prediction um and uh being able to

341
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,078
phenti a greater temporal resolution uh

342
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,399
may help understanding of genotype by

343
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,078
environment interactions and uh

344
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,759
parameterizing prop growth

345
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:34,000
model and then um for Growers um the

346
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,879
ability to detect pest or disease and

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,078
allocate resources to different parts of

348
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,078
the

349
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,759
field however uh application of proxim

350
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:50,278
amount sensors to each of these things

351
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:52,958
relies on both the uh relevance and the

352
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,480
accuracy and different sensors capture

353
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,559
different Spectra um and different

354
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,079
platforms allow collection across

355
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:03,159
varying scales so um there may be unique

356
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,958
information contained within each of

357
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:08,240
these that may increase both the

358
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,758
relevance and accuracy um of using these

359
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,320
sensors

360
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:16,600
however because of the uh complex and

361
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,600
high dimensional nature of these uh of

362
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,920
the data streams collected from these uh

363
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,800
sensors integration is uncommon and

364
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,799
typically lacks

365
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,119
generalizability so I'm going to be

366
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,879
talking about two different platforms

367
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,679
and sensors first we have uh

368
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,958
multispectral images selected by unied

369
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,599
aerial

370
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,799
verticles um and then we also have blar

371
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,839
scans collected by unoccupied ground

372
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:46,799
Vehicles so um all of this data was

373
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,959
collected on genom to field maze hybrids

374
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,879
planted at musra research

375
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:56,198
for and these are U these are all two

376
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,838
row plot now the multispectral images

377
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:01,719
you can see here have five things we

378
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,360
have blue green and red which constitute

379
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,399
typical image um and then we have red

380
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,440
Edge and near infrared as

381
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:14,759
well so uh the multispectral camera is

382
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,480
mounted to the bottom of the Drone here

383
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,879
um and all of the raw images have about

384
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,039
80% overlap so these are cards stitched

385
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,799
together using a software called piix 4D

386
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,078
to create an orth

387
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,198
Mosaic that orth Mosaic is been uploaded

388
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,479
to platform called image free developed

389
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,000
in the robins

390
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,680
lab uh to take the orthomosaic and split

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,679
it into these thought level images

392
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,440
here so the uh lar scans are collected

393
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,318
by the ground Rover here the lighter

394
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,399
camera you can see uh on the back um the

395
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:58,439
Rover is uh driven in between the rows

396
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,799
of the two row plots um and the lighter

397
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,040
scans are converted into

398
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,559
three-dimensional Point plots so you can

399
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,439
see the the two rows here and some

400
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,638
additional points being picked up from

401
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,240
adjacent plots which are ultimately

402
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,600
propped out uh to give us this this spr

403
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,318
plot here now each of these uh points

404
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,079
has an X Y and Z coordinate uh denoting

405
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:24,078
its position in space so uh the lar

406
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:27,359
scans give us a 3D reconstruction of

407
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,359
each plot

408
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,879
so in order to achieve integration uh

409
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
we're using um machine learning models

410
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:46,159
called autoencoders so an autoencoder is

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,120
a deep unsupervised um machine learning

412
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:52,600
model which takes uh its input for

413
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,318
example our multispectral image um

414
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,120
passes it through a first neural network

415
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,879
the encoder to produce um what is called

416
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,318
the latent space here so this latent

417
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,640
space is a reduced representation of the

418
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,318
original

419
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,120
image this uh latent space has then

420
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,678
passed through a second neural network

421
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:16,159
the decoder which is analogous to the

422
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,240
first to reproduce that original image

423
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,240
and this model is optimized uh such that

424
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,359
the difference between the original and

425
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,838
the Reconstruction is

426
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,719
minimized um and in that way the uh

427
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:33,359
latent space or the latent phenotypes

428
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,679
um are we you know we hope the important

429
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,558
features reducing the noise of these

430
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,519
images so we first trained this model on

431
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:45,798
the um multi-spectral images um with an

432
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:49,400
original dimensionality of about 40,000

433
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:54,319
values um down to a single Vector that

434
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,320
is um 512 um

435
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,519
values so achieving um integration on

436
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,640
these images um will include will

437
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,599
involve taking training these models on

438
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,280
multispectral images um and again on

439
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,439
point clots extracting the latent space

440
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:17,759
from each of these and um concatenating

441
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,720
them into a single object which can then

442
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,720
be used for

443
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:31,319
prediction so to evaluate um training of

444
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:33,558
the auto on multispectral images and the

445
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:37,720
point pods which I'll show in a moment

446
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:40,240
um we uh looked at visualizations of the

447
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,919
original images and the uh

448
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,038
reconstruction so you can see here that

449
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,400
uh the latent space um was able to

450
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:52,200
effectively

451
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,200
reconstruct our original

452
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:00,959
image so we similarly trained a model on

453
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,879
the lier skin uh this involves a little

454
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,240
bit or a couple of additional

455
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,480
prepressing steps so we take the um

456
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,279
original point5 as you can see on the

457
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,558
left um kind of Stack the two rows

458
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:18,000
together um so taking this xais and

459
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:22,440
flipping it um and then compressing

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,038
along the time Dimension here to produce

461
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,279
um a

462
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,519
triangular uh single Dimension density

463
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,798
map and again you can see that the

464
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,279
latent space contained both the

465
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:38,240
sufficient and necessary information to

466
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:40,279
reconstruct this um High dimensional

467
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,000
image so the next thing that we wanted

468
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,558
to do was um investigate using

469
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,519
preliminary investigations of what kind

470
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:52,038
of information was contained within the

471
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,839
lane space so um this is showing a PCA

472
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,798
thoughts of the

473
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,639
512 Len codes extracted from each of

474
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,119
about

475
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,120
5,000 colored first by ndbi and again by

476
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,519
the

477
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,918
date um so this is signaling that there

478
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,679
is biologically relevant information

479
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:14,480
contained within the latent space and

480
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,640
similarly do the same thing for our

481
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,640
Point

482
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,640
CL

483
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:29,879
pattern so our next

484
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:32,240
steps are to uh take the the latent

485
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,280
spaces and use those to predict ground

486
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,200
truth phenotypes so we've done some

487
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:41,639
preliminary tests of this with um grain

488
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,600
yield which I've um not shown here um

489
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,280
taking some uh you know simple linear

490
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,079
models um we are seeing bi electrical

491
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,079
signal um

492
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,678
and in particular um we are looking at

493
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:59,639
different ways to account for the

494
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:01,798
temporal data um that we have here

495
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,200
so with that I'd like to thank my

496
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:09,359
committee might def Sun Margaret Smith

497
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,640
i' like to thank Liam um Nick leac Amy

498
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,479
Schultz and others um who have helped

499
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,320
collect all of this data and with that

500
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,360
I'll take

501
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:24,158
question how do you measure that the

502
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,158
reconstructed image is good

503
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,798
enough that's a great question so

504
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:34,400
um Ely we'd like to use the prediction

505
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:39,000
accuracy from that second step so once

506
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,000
you take in the L using those

507
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:47,558
toyp um but you know the initial tests

508
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,839
looking at the loss of these different

509
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,240
different um you know I wouldn't it's

510
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:57,480
it's possible that

511
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,079
uh more blurry or higher lck in the auto

512
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,679
and would actually be

513
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,678
greater prediction

514
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,679
accuracy

515
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,879
the over

516
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
model

517
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,120
timately are you planning on looking at

518
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:26,159
I guess I'm curious when it comes

519
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,079
to incorporating

520
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,240
this mod

521
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,240
The

522
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,278
drus

523
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,038
Beneficial other or it's

524
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:45,038
really that you think

525
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:48,278
it's yeah absolutely so um ultimately I

526
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:51,759
think that will depend on the trade info

527
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:54,400
um but for something like um you know

528
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:59,359
more complex like yields

529
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:02,960
or Lai or resource um

530
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:05,079
the you know 3D architecture that that

531
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,840
something we are hypothesizing will lend

532
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,480
additional information that will

533
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,199
increase that accuracy um that is

534
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,798
something that we're saying to test as

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,240
well so we just use the Rovers we just

536
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,240
use the Drone

537
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,159
together can you go back to the slide

538
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:31,400
with the PCA I guess I was there was

539
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:34,799
that the pc1 had explained 9 % Mar so

540
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,120
which suggest that all 52 are pretty

541
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,119
highly

542
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,760
correlated understand that

543
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,919
right so why not just represent this

544
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,599
with two values instead of 512 I mean

545
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,320
like that first PC is explaining almost

546
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,319
everything that you have in your

547
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:05,519
52 yeah yeah so I think the

548
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:07,720
the advantage of not using something

549
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,519
would be you don't have that linearity

550
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,720
constraint um on the looking at the

551
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,839
relationship between the

552
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,720
different

553
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:23,000
um the you know one

554
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
potential reason that that that first

555
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,720
value is

556
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,520
high really highly correlated with the

557
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,798
date or something so you're really able

558
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,918
to pick out like the brightness level so

559
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:40,278
even though that high percentage it

560
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:43,278
might be something that's not

561
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,278
biologically

562
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,640
but if you did the the auto process on

563
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,600
just one

564
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:59,038
dat so so that dat isn't a factor

565
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,038
causing variation

566
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:07,558
what would it look

567
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:07,558
like maybe thing is swamped by dat yeah

568
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,720
that's you

569
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,398
get yeah so um From Below you're going

570
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,918
to get through two reconstructions of

571
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:32,918
like the ears help for example where

572
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:38,000
it's from above um particularly later

573
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:40,840
days that Cy closure to to on that um

574
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,558
yeah like Dan count

575
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,678
um yeah other that below py that you

576
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,678
have

577
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:56,000
that wonder if you tried uh going Auto

578
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:59,759
ENC train it's looking for heritability

579
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,558
so what you do do you train not the same

580
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,640
row you get

581
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:08,319
aired replicated Row in

582
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,480
other and build the

583
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,278
space yeah that that's a great Point um

584
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,079
something that we have talked about Jing

585
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,038
but not doing yet is int introducing you

586
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:22,439
know like a secondary loss function for

587
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:25,000
genotype or a you know spatial location

588
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,320
in the field or something like that so

589
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,038
um yeah I actually just actually make a

590
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:33,038
result

591
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,038
opposite

592
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,880
replic

593
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,678
us just

594
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,520
so like in other words you want the

595
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,120
decoder to generate something that

596
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,480
resembles the

597
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,798
other you can also do this by running

598
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,440
the r opposite direction grows and other

599
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:04,918
sides grow so that's the other things

600
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,960
people doing like props they're trying

601
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,960
to they run out one

602
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,278
side okay yeah thank you yeah definitely

603
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,679
try yeah yeah thank you
