1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,460
University all right thanks Frank

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,349
thanks for coming today this is

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,940
something that I started at at Madison

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,859
before I had my little hiatus on this

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,618
topic for my three and a half years here

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,210
and nikka working with Frank and then

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,009
researcher we've kind of picked back up

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,320
at Nebraska and it's something that's

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,580
really been pretty impactful through our

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,210
turf industry and so I'm really excited

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:29,428
to be able to share share with you today

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,560
at Nebraska I have a three-way split I'm

14
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,530
an extension specialist so 50% of my

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,719
time is extension and then I 20%

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,179
teaching load and a 3% research load

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,649
which I enjoy people usually hate

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,479
three-way splits but I really do like

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,660
doing all three aspects of the job and

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:48,988
for my extension side I really focus on

21
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,369
how to become more precise managers so

22
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,899
you know how are we making sure that

23
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,038
we're applying the right fertilizer is

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,170
the right amount of water or the right

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,870
product when it's needed and one of the

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,120
ways of doing that is to harness data

27
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,339
and analyze data and to make decisions

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,018
that are based on models and the latest

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,430
research so that we're not you know

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,520
getting stuck in these calendar-based

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,368
systems kind of like in turf but also I

32
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,798
know for my time here and a lot of our

33
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,259
crops like apples right we have a spray

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,880
schedule we sit down we sprayed every

35
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,769
week or two weeks because we can't

36
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,289
tolerate any type of disease or any type

37
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,929
of past or in a turf situation and grass

38
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,700
wants us to look and perform well and so

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,549
we're trying constantly trying to bat a

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,020
balance or input so that the grass is

41
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,750
looking good but it's not looking too

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:36,149
good and it's also you know free of any

43
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,280
kind of disease or weed or insect pests

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,618
and so I'm really gonna talk today about

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,299
how do we use that data it's gonna be

46
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,250
kind of a high-pitched pop kind of a

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,079
high of you and I want to tell a little

48
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,328
bit of a story of how I've gotten to

49
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,459
this point where I started off you know

50
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,548
their backyard putting green and and now

51
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,618
I'm you know the CEO of a start-up tech

52
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,509
company and you know it's it's quite a

53
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,030
learning curve over the last 10 years to

54
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,649
go from one to the other

55
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,478
so kind of my challenge is it's hurting

56
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,030
a turf industry I think the challenge of

57
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,909
people like Frank and other extension

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,649
specialists and different crops are you

59
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,989
know there's a lot of information out

60
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,409
there now social media has been huge for

61
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,360
me

62
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,549
I've really been able to grow my my

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,530
presence in the turf industry and grab

64
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,110
like 3,500 twitter twitter followers and

65
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,310
are all turf people and he just it's a

66
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,810
great way to get information out there

67
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,699
now when you have all these people

68
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,439
constantly putting information out there

69
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,479
there's a lot of information that's new

70
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,180
things can get buried and so that can be

71
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,879
kind of a challenge how do we gain

72
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,099
better adoption of best management

73
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,169
practices and got me on a horticultural

74
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,139
when we have you know good science any

75
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:46,500
bad science being spewed through

76
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,879
different social media sites that's one

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,310
of the challenges that I see right now

78
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,349
another challenge is we have all this

79
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,560
data we can collect how are we taking

80
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:57,509
that data and those data and we bring

81
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,000
them together so that we can make quick

82
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:03,090
decisions we we don't have time to spend

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,740
10 hours a day trying to combine all

84
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,939
these data and trying to analyze them

85
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,210
and then make a decision you almost get

86
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,859
paralyzed by that data and then also you

87
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,110
know what's the return on investment to

88
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,420
spending all that time or to buying the

89
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,790
equipment or to paying for computer

90
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,639
power to analyze all these data so that

91
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:23,189
we can make decisions and so great I can

92
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,229
I can do GPS free applications on my

93
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,090
golf course or on any kind of farm

94
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:30,539
am I getting a return either in plant

95
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,670
bility or from economic perspective or

96
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,949
from a time perspective and so we really

97
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,539
have to keep all of those things in mind

98
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,669
we're trying to understand what we can

99
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,129
do is extension specialists to try to

100
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,750
expand the reach of our of our

101
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,389
programming and we're seeing

102
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,219
technologies exploding too so 10 years

103
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,559
ago no golf courses had these soil

104
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,930
moisture probes and now everybody has

105
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,360
them and they have an app now that this

106
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,099
probe can't agree with and then we have

107
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,480
drones coming in a turf industry and

108
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,039
they can make pretty maps but they

109
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,769
really can't so really tell you what to

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,359
do with the information that's on these

111
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,969
different maps this is thermal imaging

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,530
there's different crop indices like NDVI

113
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:09,359
or ndre

114
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,459
and so we have all these different

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,560
disparate sources of information

116
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,680
nothing is talking to each other I got

117
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,230
my soil moisture map I got my my thermal

118
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,418
imaging map I have you know handwritten

119
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,509
data from how fast the putting greens

120
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,219
are from where the cup might be cutting

121
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:27,240
green how do I combined all that

122
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,210
information right

123
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,848
now it's all sputum screwed around it's

124
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,948
really hard for a superintendent or even

125
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:38,250
a sports field manager to handle all

126
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,110
that to them make clear decisions we

127
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,360
also have a lot of weather models and so

128
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,340
this is far from a website at Michigan

129
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,410
State does a nice job on your own degree

130
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,478
day track with that net and they take

131
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,550
different pest models and from this they

132
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,180
can understand you know some of the

133
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,250
phonology and some of the different

134
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,620
timings and life cycles of different

135
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,569
pests and different plants and give some

136
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,180
feedback but again this is not another

137
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:08,158
source of information the turf manager

138
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,990
has to actively seek out I think that

139
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:12,750
we're gonna continue to see these models

140
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,970
expand over time in our industry I think

141
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,189
across a lot of industries you know pest

142
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,599
models have historically been something

143
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:21,120
that we've been doing research on now

144
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:22,529
for 30 or 40 years I think Frankie

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,228
applies the research for the annual

146
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,568
bluegrass this particular challenging

147
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:29,158
weed that's permit making seed heads and

148
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,658
when would you spray when would you

149
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:33,899
expect to see these seed heads from

150
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:35,879
occurring we have some newer models for

151
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,870
really challenging diseases like dollar

152
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:44,009
spots it's a disease that can be pretty

153
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,478
problematic in our climate and some some

154
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,819
new models are predicting when that's

155
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,529
going to emerge you're also seeing some

156
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,050
newer models though away from the pest

157
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:54,718
models for things like nutrient use and

158
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,699
growth potential before I'm here today

159
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:58,829
we are talking in Frank's office about

160
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,590
golf courses now actually just keeping

161
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,818
track of how many clippings are good and

162
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,589
this seems like something that you'd

163
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,870
think is kind of fundamental for growing

164
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:09,060
grass we wouldn't know about how much

165
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,879
grass is being mowed because that's

166
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,129
gonna tell us how ability its ability to

167
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,259
kind of handle traffic how nutrients are

168
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,908
being removed during the clipping finger

169
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,189
moves how sugar is being allocated

170
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:21,959
within that plant and we're not leaving

171
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,250
doing that and so that's an opportunity

172
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,129
there and I think people are starting to

173
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,019
explore but I want to talk about some of

174
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:29,879
the research that I started doing as a

175
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,978
high school student and that's turned

176
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,810
into what I've been doing now and that's

177
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,338
looking at plant growth regulators I'm

178
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,918
going to use this as kind of a backdrop

179
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:41,009
for the context the story has shown how

180
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,519
I've kind of developed into building

181
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,899
this

182
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,519
decision support tool so Plato's

183
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,439
regulators are frequently applied to

184
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,439
highly maintained turf but they're also

185
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,699
extremely difficult to understand if

186
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,800
they're working and because of that

187
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,439
they're hot they're very frequently

188
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,658
misunderstood so most of the products

189
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,908
that we're using in turf inhibit

190
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:06,000
gibberellin biosynthesis biosynthesis

191
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:07,680
and that hormone crosses our leaves to

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,569
elongate so the more jibber elements

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,550
present the faster the grass is growing

194
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:14,520
I'm sure many here they have to mow

195
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,918
lawns probably would love to spray these

196
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,418
four layers on your grass because you

197
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,939
don't want to have to mow it as much and

198
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:23,848
so that's kind of what the the thinking

199
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,918
is behind some of these products so some

200
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:27,478
of the common ones that the most common

201
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,908
one is a particular product connects up

202
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,399
a couple it's a very safe plant growth

203
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,089
regulator very minimal negative

204
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,848
attributes

205
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:38,310
phyto toxicity is low and then we have

206
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:40,978
some some other PG R's Pat the future's

207
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,680
all and humid all those are route absorb

208
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,889
PG are a little bit more cytotoxic and

209
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,449
turf but still use pretty frequently and

210
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,860
so you might think well why am i putting

211
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,990
down something that's gonna make my

212
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,990
grass grow slower on a golf course

213
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,718
you mow a green every day you mow

214
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,490
fairways two or three times a week

215
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:02,550
well the real benefit to these products

216
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,528
come from they reduce clipping yields

217
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,300
which therefore reduce our nutrient

218
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:08,339
requirements and we're also mowing less

219
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,348
of that stored carbohydrate off so we've

220
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,168
seen flat health benefits we see an

221
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,759
improved strokes times and we also see

222
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:18,149
enhancements and inter playability

223
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,278
performance you see a denser stand of

224
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:23,848
turf you see an increase in green color

225
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:25,889
so I got into this research because of

226
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:28,468
this stress tolerance when I was fifteen

227
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,930
I had that back yard putting green I had

228
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:33,658
a lot of shade issues by trying to

229
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,250
suppress some of the phytochrome growth

230
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,439
response from growing grass in the shade

231
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,809
we're putting these products out onto

232
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,700
the turf and as a high school kid I'm

233
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,799
like honey I just work how do you how do

234
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,629
you make sense out of this so a

235
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,219
superintendent I worked for word kind of

236
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,860
explained it to me it's just kind of how

237
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,410
would I draw a drawn up for holidays

238
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,778
products worked so we have relative

239
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,049
clipping yield here on the y-axis so

240
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:56,789
this

241
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,559
how fast the grass would grow if we did

242
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:02,009
not apply a plant growth regulator and

243
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,588
then at day zero I put down my primo max

244
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:06,120
Whiterun x-pac ethel and we see that the

245
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,250
cleveland he'll start to grow slower and

246
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,720
slower and slower and so we see a 20

247
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,970
percent reduction in our clipping you

248
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,310
not a lot but enough to improve that

249
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,100
plant health and reduce it the nutrient

250
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:19,500
removal and then after about a week we

251
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,089
saw it kind of wear off and then all the

252
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,009
sugars that we'd store and all the

253
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,200
benefits that we gained in the

254
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,970
suppression phase then kind of get

255
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,540
burned later on in this rebound phase

256
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,850
you see a buildup of gibberellin

257
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:35,669
precursors and so once that PGR is gone

258
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,709
now all those precursors become active

259
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,240
forms of gibberellin and the grass grows

260
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,129
like crazy and it burns your

261
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,019
carbohydrates and all the plant health

262
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:45,600
benefits we're trying to see our loss

263
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,129
and so you'd think okay it's pretty

264
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,040
simple you know you just have to just

265
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:51,870
apply the PGR is fairly frequently to to

266
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,000
maintain clipping yield suppression you

267
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,070
want to avoid the rebound so you might

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,759
say I need to apply of every about ten

269
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,620
days

270
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,659
you could also say I just watch the

271
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,440
grass and when it starts to regrow maybe

272
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:06,689
I'll just reapply the PGR the problem

273
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,579
with that is the absolute clipping

274
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,899
yields are all over the board and this

275
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:11,639
is what we were talking about at Frank's

276
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,490
office before this thing's like

277
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:17,490
mineralization of nitrogen water status

278
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,709
other environmental factors cause the

279
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,778
absolute clipping yield to fluctuate a

280
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:24,599
lot from day to day so the black line

281
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,519
here is plots that are treated or not

282
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,470
treated with plant growth regulators and

283
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,179
the red lines are plots that were

284
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,519
treated with plant growth regulators and

285
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:35,129
so there's times where we apply the PGR

286
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,809
and we had less clipping yield and then

287
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,208
the PGR wears off and we see a little

288
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:41,099
bit of a rebound and then we reapply the

289
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,389
PGR we have a little more suppression

290
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,759
and then it wears off and it's

291
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:46,230
rebounding again but we're not

292
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,909
maintaining that clipping yield

293
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,259
suppression so we're not maintaining all

294
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,939
those plant health benefits

295
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,919
therefore we shouldn't waste our money

296
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,630
with these applications and if we're

297
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,439
like me growing grass in the shade we're

298
00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:01,980
not really maximizing the health of that

299
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,560
turf and this is a prime example this is

300
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,300
a 2015 PGA Championship I was

301
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,989
volunteering there at Whistling Straits

302
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,240
going into that

303
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,310
that tournament they were dry they were

304
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,959
cool weather and then the Friday before

305
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:15,549
the tournament week started they got

306
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,069
three quarters of an inch of rain and

307
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,469
then it got really warm we see a

308
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,750
mineralization flush there's a big

309
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,940
increase in plant available water and we

310
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,190
see really really rapid growth during

311
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,899
the week of the tournament they ended up

312
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,970
using the models I want to talk about in

313
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,639
a second so we knew that PG others were

314
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,680
working but if they weren't apply using

315
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,330
those models they would say hey that PG

316
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,829
r doesn't work anymore his prime she

317
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,200
says crap you know I don't waste my

318
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,300
money on it so we needed some kind of a

319
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,950
model to help guide these applications

320
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:46,990
because her eyes aren't going to really

321
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,970
tell us you forgetting clipping yield

322
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,560
suppression or rebound therefore are we

323
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,339
getting these plant health benefits or

324
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,958
not so look at that look at the class

325
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,020
research this is you know before I

326
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,359
started my research in 2005 we found

327
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,850
that during the summertime we see a

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,028
reduction and efficacy of the product

329
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:11,379
specifically how long did it last so we

330
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:13,240
found that it lasted for pretty sure so

331
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,009
if I wanted to visualize that curve I

332
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,589
showed before which would be in that

333
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:20,230
blue line when it's really hot outside

334
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,029
I'm talking about ethica heatwave so

335
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,320
that the Haveri temperature would be 90

336
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:26,679
degrees so that's like a high of you

337
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,149
know upper 90s lows in the upper 70s you

338
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,620
know we're seeing like seven days of

339
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,539
gross suppression out of these these

340
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,459
products like primo max which next back

341
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:34,750
Gothel but there we go it's the kind of

342
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,429
weather like we're having right now or

343
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,940
maybe even colder than right now we

344
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:43,328
might get three three weeks gross

345
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,980
oppression with that same product so

346
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,569
this was you know something we did and

347
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,930
early two-thousands got published in

348
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,000
2009 and now how do I get this into the

349
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:54,549
hands of our superintendents right

350
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,549
that's a challenge to me as an extension

351
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:59,199
specialist can I make this easy and you

352
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,669
know talking about a sine wave curve

353
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,709
it's a really good way for people's eyes

354
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:05,679
to glaze over really really quickly

355
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:07,929
right so we wanted to do was try to see

356
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,028
if there some kind of a way that we can

357
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:12,039
predict these timings so what we did is

358
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:14,700
we applied a growing degree to a base

359
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,469
approach to trying to see if we could

360
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,959
understand this the skew and the period

361
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,790
of the sine wave based on growing degree

362
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,829
to accumulation and get it

363
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:27,610
from thinking about things in calendar

364
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:30,129
days since research was started in 2008

365
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,659
it's pretty boring it's pretty simple I

366
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:33,250
think it's kind of novel way of thinking

367
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:35,559
about something but actually doing it's

368
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,480
not very hard you go out you spray your

369
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,329
plant growth regulators and then you

370
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,700
just collect clippings over and over and

371
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,830
over every day for ten years or not look

372
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,750
to what 70,000 clippings have been

373
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,820
collected from this research you have

374
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,970
different PG ARS different rates

375
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,800
different grass areas it's a lot and

376
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,050
then all you do is we just fit the

377
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,809
relative clipping yield to the growing

378
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:00,039
degree dead data and then from that we

379
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,159
can estimate what our application

380
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,629
intervals are so our first study was

381
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,939
done with this tradition pack Athlon

382
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,559
Bank cross cutting greens and when we we

383
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,440
follow only applied as the label said

384
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,569
every four weeks that we'd apply the PGR

385
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,460
and then we have suppression and then it

386
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,710
wear off and we get that rebound so very

387
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,750
counterintuitive counterproductive not

388
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,360
helping help them our plant out weed

389
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,399
reapply suppression rebound suppression

390
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,110
and then the starting to occur on that

391
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,600
through applications obviously not what

392
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,550
we want to do but we took all this data

393
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,740
instead of plotting it as Cal today on

394
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:36,129
the bottom we did it as cumulative

395
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,710
growing degree days after application so

396
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:40,179
this is application at day zero and then

397
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,980
growing degree days which is just a

398
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,949
summation of the average air temperature

399
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,740
in degrees Celsius we use for the base

400
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,259
of 0 degrees Celsius using graphs we

401
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,240
test a different basis and the base zero

402
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:54,220
had the greatest through R squared value

403
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,909
so that's why we had confidence in that

404
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,730
but we found that for about 0 to 200

405
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:02,289
growing degree days after application we

406
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,970
had suppression and then from about

407
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:06,459
three to eight hundred nine degrees we

408
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,750
had a rebound and so if we based on a

409
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,750
research done else they would apply it

410
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,159
230 or fewer growing degree days be able

411
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,009
to maintain their creeping yield

412
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,679
suppression so this could be if the

413
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:20,049
average temperature is 20 degrees that's

414
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,969
10 days if the average temperature is 10

415
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,859
degrees you've got 22 intervals right so

416
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,149
now it's being flexible so we're

417
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,100
applying these herbicides and these

418
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:29,049
plant protection products based on the

419
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,460
metabolism of the product and not just

420
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:34,120
based on what the label says for a

421
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,580
counter so what we still only applied PG

422
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,590
ours every 200 growing degree

423
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,480
we had a nice even clipping the old

424
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:42,210
suppression averaging about fifteen

425
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,980
percent less than the control and it no

426
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,370
was at or below the control for the

427
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,930
entire growing season as a result we saw

428
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,399
an improvement in the color and the

429
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:52,199
quality and it danced to you that plant

430
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,649
you see an improvement and things like

431
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,360
shade tolerance and heat tolerance and

432
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,220
we throw know that application rate

433
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,259
didn't really affect interval very much

434
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,240
I only talked about that today for lack

435
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,590
of time but if you've got higher rates

436
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,360
instead of having fifteen percent

437
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:12,090
average depression you might get thirty

438
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,830
percent so we've been doing this tile

439
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,360
for ten years how's the first study

440
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,100
we've been doing it for all these

441
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
different plant growth regulators and

442
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,570
this is just the table for one putting

443
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,419
green so this is creeping bentgrass

444
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,830
putting green the rate range so but the

445
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,349
rate effect would have on the amount of

446
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,910
suppression what the ideal intervals it

447
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,409
being growing degree days for all the

448
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:33,269
different products and then a

449
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:35,279
superintendent start mixing products on

450
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,079
me and they start asking but what if I

451
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,789
mix this product with that product

452
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,550
you know how much suppression do I get

453
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,319
how long does it last right and so these

454
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,639
are really challenging questions I go I

455
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,850
don't know I get to figure it out

456
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,279
yourself I guess so again I'm taking all

457
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,860
this data and I can get a publishing

458
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,899
it's great that's not the last step the

459
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,090
last step is getting it into the hands

460
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,980
of our end users so they can actually

461
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,009
use it and make decisions and how

462
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,529
they're applying their products so it

463
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,990
was a non computer person but a data

464
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:09,180
person as most you guys are you go to

465
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,620
Excel so you build Excel sheets like

466
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,959
this and I was pretty proud of this

467
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,659
there's a lot of if-then statements in

468
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,209
there and looking up a files and color

469
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,830
code based on things so the

470
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,259
superintendent would come in pick their

471
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,659
temperature unit their active ingredient

472
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,940
the rate they wanted to use then our

473
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,170
models were kicking on the backside tell

474
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,150
them what their ideal growing the

475
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,620
greeting interval should be if they

476
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,990
wanted to make their own they could even

477
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,639
set their own interval and then I would

478
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,019
come in and they could pick is if the

479
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,270
days they applied the plant growth

480
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,650
regulators and it would tell them what

481
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,809
their cumulative growing degree days

482
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,610
were and their approximate levels of

483
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,899
clipping the old suppression and then

484
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:48,269
they would warn them when they need to

485
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,400
reapply I even knew some extra if things

486
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,289
in there so you can

487
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,820
in the forecasted weather and so you

488
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:55,909
could say well maybe I have to reapply

489
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:59,059
on this state even though it's currently

490
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,100
you know a week away it works pretty

491
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,839
well it worked really well for bang

492
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:05,059
crash screams but there were some

493
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,129
challenges there another question

494
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,109
someone asked was well this is great I'm

495
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,180
really bad at sprayer math so can you

496
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,219
help me out with a sprayer math so you

497
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,930
go to another sheet and you you haven't

498
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,569
put in this the area that they want to

499
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,730
spray and you know the sprayer setup how

500
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:22,399
many gallons of water are they gonna put

501
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,720
over an acre and then what products so

502
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
they want to use and so you start

503
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,500
building all this into Excel and you put

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,109
it out there on your website and people

505
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:37,099
start downloading it but there's some

506
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:40,429
problems with that the first one is new

507
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:42,379
versions so every time I get a new model

508
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,420
data and I need to add something to it I

509
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,820
can't just easily go off to everybody

510
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,620
and say hey here's the new version of

511
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,029
the website of the app you got to stop

512
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,809
using the old one and use the new one

513
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:55,819
right so that was always an issue but

514
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:58,519
other problem was bugs and more

515
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:00,529
typically user problems you could

516
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,420
imagine if you had a cell that's got

517
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,609
like five if-then statements in there

518
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,440
and someone clicks the wrong cell and

519
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,250
then they send it to you and say can you

520
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,509
fix this for me

521
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:15,829
it's a little frustrating their problem

522
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,349
to is they had to manually enter their

523
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:19,449
weather data over and over and over so

524
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,829
this was some of the kind of the

525
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,890
functional problems with an Excel type

526
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:25,970
of an approach to to using these

527
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,860
different types of models I know

528
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,350
Cornell's got some great models their

529
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:32,809
Excel base for things like soil test

530
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:34,849
interpretations and mineralization and

531
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,409
they're really good but they can be a

532
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,579
little bit intimidating even for me I

533
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,920
thought they no should know what's going

534
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:42,439
on I still looking at no like okay how

535
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,690
do I do this you know the right way

536
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,190
from a bigger picture perspective though

537
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,940
it's an Extension educator I'm

538
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:52,519
constantly asked about you know how do

539
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,920
you document this kind of stuff how do

540
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,319
you document your impact instead of just

541
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,940
saying like well it was downloaded 400

542
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,069
times well big deal are four people

543
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,559
actually using it are they actually

544
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:05,299
implementing the recommendations based

545
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,069
on this so they just download it once

546
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,359
and then you know threw it out because

547
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,939
they didn't know how to use it and so

548
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,069
that's another problem that we have an

549
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,180
extension as it is how do we document

550
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:16,279
what we're doing if we write a

551
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,830
publication about how we should do

552
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,389
something but then we don't really and

553
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,769
they can come no how many times it's

554
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,480
downloaded we still don't know how

555
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,670
people actually doing it are we getting

556
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,009
a change in practice and so we needed

557
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,850
some ways more interactive this is very

558
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:31,129
one-sided

559
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,889
I give them information it goes out to

560
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,960
them they choose to use it or not I want

561
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,090
something that I give out to them they

562
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,340
can use within this they're using it

563
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:42,199
it's coming back to me so that I can

564
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,909
understand you know how are they using

565
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,950
these products I'll be implementing it

566
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,500
what are some ways I could evolve my

567
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,450
research committees to meet some of the

568
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,160
challenges that they're giving me so I

569
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:59,299
need I need some more communication

570
00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:00,860
through my extension so it was it became

571
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,349
pretty clear to me and this actually

572
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:06,439
came to me it clear to me at Cornell one

573
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:08,959
of my good friends in small was Plant

574
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,420
Pathology PhD student work and decision

575
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,799
support tool and Bill Fry's lab and I

576
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,390
was like I got this idea for one for

577
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,369
Turk to when I freeze plant growth

578
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,610
regulators and he's like I'll ask cool

579
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:20,929
bill and so I left Cornell and I you

580
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,879
know no I'm a professor and I have a

581
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,500
startup package and I'm like I want to

582
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,470
put some money into trying to build on

583
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,029
that which is really intimidating right

584
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,089
because none of us have background in

585
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,920
really software design and it's a whole

586
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,919
language and something we're just not

587
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,410
really comfortable with it took some

588
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,120
time it took about two years so the

589
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,100
first thing you're thinking about is you

590
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,809
got to find developers that you can

591
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:46,789
actually do this and in Lincoln we're

592
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,609
having this surge of they call it the

593
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,889
silicon Prairie now all these companies

594
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:55,788
are coming from Silicon Valley to cheat

595
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:59,359
Nebraska there's a wealth of student

596
00:21:55,788 --> 00:22:01,398
new graduates and so it's hard to find

597
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:04,038
even developers and you get what you pay

598
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:05,358
for you can pay a lot of money like 200

599
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,669
grand to build a map but it might be

600
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:09,558
awesome but if you missed the market

601
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,090
anything but other thing I'll redevelop

602
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,099
it and it's gonna be 200 more thousand

603
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:15,709
dollars to get it there or you do what I

604
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:18,079
do and you hire some cheaper small firm

605
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,879
they take forever and they're not

606
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,148
responsive so it took a couple years to

607
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:24,769
kind of get things going

608
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:25,998
funding support was important so one of

609
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,159
the things I did is I went to my

610
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:30,048
department head and said iris idea

611
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,929
can you help you know help me with that

612
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:35,058
initial startup cost you try making

613
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,919
money on it I'll pay you back if we

614
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:38,898
don't make money on it then I guess

615
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,970
you're out so you know not a lot of risk

616
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:44,658
for him but he still said it's a good

617
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:47,118
enough idea we're going to do it design

618
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:49,460
considerations this is huge I'm building

619
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:51,259
an app it's got to be intuitive people

620
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,819
on your phone right now I'm sure you're

621
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,979
realizing if the app is not intuitive

622
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:58,069
and easy you're not gonna use it right

623
00:22:54,979 --> 00:23:00,830
and only you know how a grower is going

624
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,479
to use this type of technology because

625
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,069
you've probably done it you work with

626
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:05,330
them in the field you know what they

627
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:08,388
want to see you know what they don't

628
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:10,249
want to see an app guide my first

629
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:12,829
attempt at this they did it themselves

630
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:15,048
it was hideous and ugly and not

631
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:17,928
functional so now I have to come in

632
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:19,668
every time we do variants I draw up in

633
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,649
PowerPoint this is what I want to do

634
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,690
this is how it has to work it takes time

635
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:25,758
but you save time and money later on

636
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,409
because you're not redoing is there

637
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:33,319
their initial tab which usually is

638
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:35,210
nowhere near what and use yours and then

639
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,739
you spend all this money you're on the

640
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,239
hook and now you have to figure out how

641
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:40,639
am I going to advertise it home and get

642
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:43,220
adoption the benefit there is having

643
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:44,628
that big Twitter following if you build

644
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,829
something that works you get this good

645
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,028
word of mouth especially in the

646
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,819
tight-knit community like the turf

647
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:54,200
industry and so we've seen a really nice

648
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:56,239
adoption of it this is not greenkeeper

649
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,919
this is what I did for my my interview

650
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:59,389
though at Nebraska so I came in right

651
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,489
away and said this is what I want to

652
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:03,378
build when I get here and so I drew this

653
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:05,179
up right before my interview you know it

654
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:07,158
had things like my record keeper and

655
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,769
right like the weather forecast and pest

656
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:13,310
outbreak maps and online resource

657
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:15,769
that link to our information it was

658
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:17,509
gonna display things like what products

659
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:20,299
were applied so I can keep tracking my

660
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,920
PG arse if I'm tracking my PJs I can

661
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:24,319
also track fungicides I can track

662
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,980
fertilizers I can track water right so

663
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,960
that just kind of became intuitive and

664
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,299
if I know someone's true spraying on

665
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,890
fungicide for example now I can start

666
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:36,019
seeing where they are and start building

667
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,210
Maps as I understand oh maybe we have a

668
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:40,339
lot of dollar spot outbreak in southeast

669
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,079
Nebraska well their users could then

670
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:43,789
gain and learn from that so instead of

671
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,899
having to pick up the phone and say hey

672
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,970
what are you seeing your course right

673
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,560
now they can just go onto the app and

674
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,450
they can see what's kind of going on in

675
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,279
their region so over time we've ended up

676
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,710
building our app called greenkeeper and

677
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,539
so this is a decision support tool it's

678
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,220
got a terrible name it's green keeper

679
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,379
app it's not really an app you download

680
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,480
it's a web-based apps but it really

681
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,070
confuses people so if you're ever gonna

682
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,680
build an app make sure it's really a

683
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:11,119
native app for your phone or just call

684
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,039
it green keeper which is the way I try

685
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,439
to refer to it now unfortunately that

686
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,980
domain was unavailable so keep your app

687
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,180
is where it's at right now and so you

688
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,670
can access it through internet browser

689
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,289
one nice thing about this is think about

690
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,400
your growers they are gonna be in the

691
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,559
field they're gonna want to sit on the

692
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,300
phone they might see on a tablet they

693
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,329
might do a lot of data entry on their

694
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:35,240
computer so by doing a web-based app now

695
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:36,919
they have a lot more flexibility in in

696
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,130
how they can interact with that and they

697
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:43,430
can see in access or data any any other

698
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:46,580
location they said what it really looks

699
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,710
like it is not pretty in the app side we

700
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:51,559
call this front end front end makes

701
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,329
things look beautiful my guys love doing

702
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,759
the backend stuff figuring out the

703
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:58,429
algorithms figuring out the code they

704
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,930
hate Fernet so that's the thing I could

705
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,160
hire someone to make it look pretty

706
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,930
but we're finding from our

707
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,820
superintendents is they love it because

708
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,549
it's ugly but it's simple and it's easy

709
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:09,500
so they can log in they can see what's

710
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,409
been applied to their greens they can

711
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,880
watch the products expire they can see

712
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,470
how they've been fertilizing if you

713
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,900
scroll down they click at the weather

714
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,960
but get reminders when things you know

715
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,300
come out of control and so it's it's

716
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,950
real simple website

717
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,839
if you're looking okay we're do any

718
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,730
website analytics to see how many people

719
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,230
are using your site one thing people

720
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,630
want is a low number it's called their

721
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,599
bounce rate a bounce rate means you go

722
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,040
onto the website and then you want

723
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,569
someone to stick there and click around

724
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,889
they don't want to like log on to your

725
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:42,679
site and say this I don't need anything

726
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,810
here in this leap but for me I want a

727
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,450
decent bounce rate because I want my

728
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:49,519
superintendents to log in every day look

729
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,740
at the homepage and go I'm pretty good

730
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,809
today I can go on and do something else

731
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,910
right so that's actually a good thing to

732
00:26:53,809 --> 00:27:02,149
have sometimes you said to know what the

733
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:04,310
goal so our PGR display is real easy now

734
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,050
that the a query keeps track of five

735
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:07,789
hundred and seventy variants of those

736
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:09,710
grown ingredients so they don't have to

737
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:11,990
know all of the the ins and outs of the

738
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,660
model I had automatic grabs or other

739
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,250
data every night I have to pay for that

740
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,960
used to be six hundred dollars a month

741
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,829
we switches over to a different provider

742
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,299
that's fifty bucks a month but you know

743
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:24,949
it's automatically in the weather data

744
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:27,169
and the ten-day forecast

745
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,529
so for these PG hours for example this

746
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:33,890
one trim it Popovich's all what I was

747
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:35,839
praying for was PGR a day I sprayed the

748
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,310
day it's likely to expire based on the

749
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,879
forecast in this case it really has

750
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:39,649
expired

751
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,450
the amount of growing degree days that

752
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,370
we're at versus what we are goal

753
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,740
reapplication interval was and then how

754
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:47,209
much Depression a rebound that we get so

755
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,769
this treatment is starting to go from

756
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,259
suppression into rebound

757
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,509
whereas this primo max on the t's is

758
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:55,549
still not yet expired and it's going to

759
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,289
expire you know several weeks later so

760
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,909
real quick superintendent looks at it

761
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,230
and go oh I'm gonna spray next Monday

762
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,090
I'll throw the Primo on the tank then

763
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,950
they go on with their day it's quick

764
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:08,329
it's easy and all the data is in the

765
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:10,069
background we've also been expanded it

766
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:12,349
to do things like the sprayer mixing we

767
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:13,789
know they struggle with math so they is

768
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:16,129
coming down when they pick I'm treating

769
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,200
my greens this is the sprayer it tells

770
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,790
them how many tanks how many gallons and

771
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,740
then they come in they picked the

772
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,960
products they want to use the raids the

773
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,509
pass the interval they'd like to use if

774
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,130
it's not based on growing degree days

775
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:30,079
and it gives them a nice list of how

776
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,660
much product is needed to makes a full

777
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,849
tank to make partial thanks it keeps

778
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,920
track of all this inventory so it's real

779
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:39,349
simple for a superintendent

780
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,080
and you know have that and they push

781
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:43,669
finalized mix they get a PDF they can

782
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,829
print off they give it off to a spray

783
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,019
tech you're an intern and they mix it up

784
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:49,129
and it's less chance for a math there so

785
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,289
right there we could have a big impact

786
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,330
but trying to minimize some of those

787
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:55,159
math days he always comes on to me

788
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:58,029
though for that math to be right right

789
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,890
so you have to do a lot of we call it QA

790
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:02,389
Quality Assurance and make sure that you

791
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,770
know you do different models so your

792
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,620
make sure your math is working a way

793
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:08,650
that needs to work so it's recording the

794
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,939
big features of greenkeeper initially

795
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,070
and so over the last two years we've

796
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,500
gone from zero to thirty eight hundred

797
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:17,689
courses fifty nine hundred users

798
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,759
multiple users can be shared at one

799
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,460
course and we've tracked eighty-nine

800
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,440
thousand different products so what I'm

801
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,829
talking about extension impacts now

802
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,529
that's my impact I can show who's using

803
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:32,089
it how's how it's being used how offer

804
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:35,029
they logging in but more importantly

805
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:37,759
right here products being tracked I can

806
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:39,950
see how are they using this PGR aaanthor

807
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,200
ways how they using this BGR and greens

808
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,940
what rates are they using what intervals

809
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,789
- they like all the sudden now I can

810
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,590
document my impact to my extension bean

811
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:50,599
is show that my research is being

812
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:52,339
applied directly to growers and they're

813
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,269
using it and that's something you get

814
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:58,759
when you develop an app like this so you

815
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:00,289
know Google Analytics is great so right

816
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:06,440
now you know we're doing about one point

817
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:08,299
seven thousand logins a month from our

818
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,309
different users and so we have a bunch

819
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:12,200
of users that try it out but these are

820
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:15,139
kind of our monthly active users one

821
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,670
point seven hundred one thousand seven

822
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:22,180
areas which is really really great

823
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:22,180
amount of adoption for through the app

824
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:29,480
our users are highly engaged which is

825
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:32,240
great they give us amazing testimonials

826
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,549
like Bill keen here you know with

827
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,440
greenkeeper I've made five fewer PGR

828
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:38,659
apps for my greens and two fewer to my

829
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,789
fairways that's real savings and product

830
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,990
later another way you can rate document

831
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:45,259
your impact if you're an extension

832
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,970
specialist the other problem trade-off

833
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:49,849
there they give you a lot of feedback

834
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,839
they feel invested in this so they're

835
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,399
going to tell you what they

836
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:56,449
what they like what they don't like

837
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:59,120
that's all kind of being added and it's

838
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,680
great because then you do what they want

839
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,629
it's other buddies about how they you

840
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,060
know and they had the idea for this and

841
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:08,420
we did this and it's continuing to make

842
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:09,829
this decision support you will grow so

843
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,779
if you're thinking about developing a

844
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:13,369
tool like this the the most important

845
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,059
thing to remember to make it successful

846
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:20,089
is that you need to offer your end-users

847
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:22,369
more value and time and money than they

848
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:24,289
put into an application there's a lot of

849
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:26,269
apps out there they want you to answer

850
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:28,490
all this information you know everything

851
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:30,589
but they don't really give anything back

852
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:33,319
this app is giving you so much

853
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:34,909
information back with past models and

854
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,399
fertilizer tracking fertilizer

855
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,019
recommendations these PG are models that

856
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,519
could be complex people to calculate

857
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:42,079
it's all right there and it's

858
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,389
automatically updating for them

859
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,649
and so that it's worth their time so you

860
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,120
can give you all their sprayer

861
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:51,740
information to assess your room so you

862
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,469
know like this the new dollar spot model

863
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,329
again make it real simple so that we

864
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,670
have all their areas there they put a

865
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:00,470
stress disease threshold their wrist

866
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,779
rest rolled so they can look at some

867
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,430
really complex model it automatically

868
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:07,069
tells them not the number just are they

869
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,779
protected or at risk real simple real

870
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:11,210
quick

871
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:12,680
it can it consults with the yet what

872
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,269
fungicides have been spray if a

873
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,670
fungicide had been sprayed on these back

874
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:18,589
nineties and this namely your threshold

875
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,700
was above 20% it would just say

876
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:21,740
protective because you're still

877
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,870
protected if the growers I need to know

878
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,460
oh that fungicide protects against this

879
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:30,439
disease it's automatically my penalty

880
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,509
another like pet peeve of mine is soils

881
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,509
and we've all you know we do modeling

882
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:37,059
and the front understand with the soil

883
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:39,650
phosphorus potassium levels are

884
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,839
maintaining our turf but then you look

885
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,640
at soil test reports from labs and

886
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,500
they're gonna analyze everything all

887
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,330
your molybdenum is know whoa what are

888
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,039
you talking about you molybdenum is low

889
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:52,429
like it's crazy there's no research to

890
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,079
support that that number so then we said

891
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,880
okay well we can do soil testing we can

892
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,889
you tissue testing in here you just pick

893
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,170
where your samples from and knows about

894
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,630
your site you give a little barcode you

895
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,679
send it off to lab two days later we get

896
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,869
the important thing oil pH

897
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,720
for pH Organa matter may looks three may

898
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:11,699
look phosphorus potassium the things

899
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,399
actually important and then we give

900
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,259
University recommendations so if you're

901
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,469
doing like a salt test on sand and you

902
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:20,519
sink your sodium is high it just says

903
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,249
interpretations is not applicable you're

904
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,409
on sand you don't have the population of

905
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:27,028
clay right other globs would try to

906
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:29,070
scare you and tell you you got Polly's

907
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:30,868
products down now we can just pump the

908
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:33,240
universal recommendations right into a

909
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:35,368
tool and we can do it cheap we do like

910
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,200
twenty bucks for a sample independent

911
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:39,178
soils consultants can charge you $100

912
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,369
for a sample and so we can just kind of

913
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:43,369
cut some of that right out of the system

914
00:33:44,778 --> 00:33:50,429
there have been some growing pains we've

915
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,950
been growing a lot and the university

916
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:55,769
knows is that bill this is awesome eat a

917
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,360
former LLC like cool you know I had the

918
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,769
support and the protection of the big

919
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,158
University behind you

920
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:03,990
he knew this pretty low risk who has

921
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,100
ever done a SWOT analysis you know

922
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,010
strengths weaknesses opportunities

923
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:10,230
threats universities come on we don't

924
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,389
have SWOT analysis we don't when you're

925
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,250
you have protection behind you if you're

926
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,899
a private industry you better know those

927
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,449
you know your weaknesses and your

928
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:20,909
threats really clearly so a little bit

929
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:22,469
scared about that they said first of all

930
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,869
you're making money and universities

931
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,338
nonprofit so that's a problem you're

932
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,929
putting credit cards state law in

933
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,519
Nebraska says we cannot store credit

934
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:31,079
card information so that was a problem

935
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,628
and then you have all the university

936
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,490
constraints about user agreements and

937
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:37,409
how do you use the logo and all this

938
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,500
stuff it just got crazy so we had to

939
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,338
form an LLC another Cornell alumni my

940
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,440
master's advisor

941
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:46,039
I've sold out and I formed our turf

942
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,280
great LLC and now we pay a small royalty

943
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:52,230
revenue to Nebraska the other problem

944
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,409
comes up in is now we have all these

945
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,088
ideas how do we fund it right it's a

946
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,740
free app people want stuff for free

947
00:34:57,088 --> 00:35:00,199
online like for some reason people think

948
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:02,129
they don't have to pay for stuff online

949
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:04,529
so there's different there's different

950
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,640
models out there for us to kind of make

951
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,040
this work

952
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,598
but you know looking for partnerships

953
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,940
looking at ways they can roll the

954
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,289
greenkeeper app and so develop rapidly

955
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,880
because there's other apps out there and

956
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:16,369
if we're not developing then we're going

957
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,010
to have some problems

958
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:22,039
and then you know just the challenges of

959
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,810
trying to run a small growing startup on

960
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,460
top of having a three-way appointment as

961
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:27,230
a professor so these are some of the

962
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,690
challenges that I've been trying to face

963
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,280
they're very supportive of this because

964
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,389
they are getting some royalty money out

965
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
of it

966
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:35,779
but it's just some of the issues that

967
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,940
I'm having so if you're thinking about

968
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,430
developing an app and successful these

969
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,960
are some real things that come along a

970
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,279
couple years later that are gonna be

971
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,929
kind of smack you in the face and you

972
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,730
have to be kind of aware of as I kind of

973
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:51,679
wrap up though I wanted to show you know

974
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,030
where is the app going it's much it's

975
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,159
give me a much broader than the things

976
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,260
I've showed today and you know I'm not

977
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:59,269
doing much PGI research we've done a lot

978
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,430
of it but we're not we're doing you're

979
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:04,099
getting into GPS freyr's variable rate

980
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:06,250
sensors you know the big thing in egg

981
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:09,469
crops the sensors on mowers and drones

982
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,090
but we don't need that in turf why we

983
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:12,709
take a drone over our grass every day

984
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,200
every three days right and it's got a

985
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:18,230
active sensor connected to a battery so

986
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:20,809
we can have really nice crop matter crop

987
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,550
monitoring cops coding technology it's

988
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:25,009
just sitting on the back of a mower and

989
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,650
so from that we can look at water status

990
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:29,510
and disease and a nitrogen status and

991
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,750
and so this is some of the data that

992
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:35,300
we've been collecting this is just a

993
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,679
different fairway over time as you can

994
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,990
see the stress starts picking up in the

995
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,029
summer time so we're able to start

996
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,679
looking at that and modeling that and so

997
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,900
all the research that we're doing now is

998
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:46,429
getting pumped right back into our

999
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,680
greenkeepers so we're trying to balance

1000
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,779
you know our research to make sure we're

1001
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,909
sitting the needs that you need for

1002
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,070
precision turf management and so this

1003
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:58,899
this is one one of them things I think

1004
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,900
we're really excited about going forward

1005
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:03,920
if you don't want to use a sensor on a

1006
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,610
more you can all use it on a Segway so

1007
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,260
this is one of our GIS guys who you know

1008
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:12,829
is also a pilot but he's got us is a

1009
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,330
pollen scientific ACS for 30 crop sensor

1010
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,849
on there and he's just driving a putting

1011
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:19,670
green and from that you know he can get

1012
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,380
up it can learn a lot about you know how

1013
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,360
that puting green grass is performing

1014
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,360
nitrogen is performing

1015
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:31,419
and then ultimately we hope I want

1016
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,819
greenkeeper to look something like this

1017
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,889
so this is kind of a Google Earth

1018
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,559
overlay of the different fairways here

1019
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:40,779
at this gym acre golf course is a golf

1020
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,610
course that I kind of took over from the

1021
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,830
city our students now I'll take care of

1022
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,730
this is awesome your students are taking

1023
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,139
care of it they're getting real-world

1024
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,329
experience and then I can use as a

1025
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:51,940
research test facility and so now we're

1026
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:54,400
looking at you know mating GPS failure

1027
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,050
rate end applications to try to even out

1028
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,690
some of these differences in the

1029
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,430
chlorophyll content of these leaves and

1030
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:05,740
so I think it's a pretty cool

1031
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:07,480
opportunity to have that in Lincoln so

1032
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm not gonna go long because Katie and

1033
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,070
I both remember sitting and seminars I

1034
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,809
just go way over so I'm gonna wrap up

1035
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,960
here because I know you guys probably

1036
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:18,429
want to go to how was your day if you're

1037
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,230
thinking about decision support tool is

1038
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:22,750
an extension I think it's a great way to

1039
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,369
engage your growers and to expand your

1040
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,409
audience and it's really interactive

1041
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,659
they're getting it two-sided you're not

1042
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:29,980
just you know providing information and

1043
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:31,769
just hoping and praying that they're

1044
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,090
actually using what you're telling them

1045
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:36,099
I think it's a lot opportunities out

1046
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,570
there this is church but a lot of

1047
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:39,279
especially our highly maintained

1048
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,860
specialty crops and we see a lot of

1049
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,570
applications being applied a lot of data

1050
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,190
could be being collected you know I

1051
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,769
think there's aa plication Xin there

1052
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,110
apples grapes green house my wife is

1053
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:51,789
doing hop stuff now in Nebraska and just

1054
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,849
keeping track of all that you know downy

1055
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:57,610
mildew pressure applications fertility

1056
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:59,469
drip lines et a lot of data you could

1057
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,750
build these types interfaces for lots of

1058
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:03,849
different crops out there it's a great

1059
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,489
way for our for us to integrate our

1060
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:08,380
science in a way that's intuitive and

1061
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:09,939
helpful to our growers and something

1062
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,789
that they want to engage and that's how

1063
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,240
you can go from zero users to you know

1064
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:18,909
3800 golf courses in two years

1065
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:20,439
perspective there's about 12,500 preen

1066
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:22,329
nicely maintained golf courses in the

1067
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,880
United States so for us I have about a

1068
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:27,519
quarter of those you know maintain the

1069
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,710
golf courses it kind of picks up for the

1070
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,860
3,000 mom-and-pop so you know I barely

1071
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,380
solvent I think it's a pretty massive

1072
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,539
amount of integration and it's just by

1073
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,769
using the our data and putting it away

1074
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,239
this intuitive and helpful and ease

1075
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:44,509
so thank you very much for having me

1076
00:39:42,239 --> 00:40:12,479
today I'd be happy to take any questions

1077
00:39:44,510 --> 00:40:14,640
now hi Bill Jennifer grant I hate your

1078
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,048
questions for you you talked about you

1079
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,788
know keeping the competitive edge and

1080
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:20,759
that there's a lot of competition out

1081
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:22,470
there could you comment on what you see

1082
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,240
as competition in the turf industry

1083
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:26,159
right now are these for this type of

1084
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:30,088
information and applications and

1085
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:34,679
secondly on what I wondered if you have

1086
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:36,538
many or any non golf course users yeah

1087
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:37,500
the first other edge of the second

1088
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,809
question first

1089
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,980
that's we have sports turf people are

1090
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:43,048
using it we actually have athletic

1091
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,750
fields built in as an area type of thing

1092
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:48,000
greenkeeper so when the grown degree do

1093
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:50,849
miles for sports turf is also in

1094
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,250
greenkeeper I guess from a competition

1095
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,650
perspective there's different apps out

1096
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,739
there there's a bunch like on Lincoln

1097
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,420
and playbooks and a lot of them are

1098
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,879
keeping track of apps but it's different

1099
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,400
from us versus them and we're giving

1100
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,349
them the users information back we're

1101
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,240
having those models in there and some of

1102
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:10,798
us 570 models I haven't published

1103
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,479
because I haven't been proprietary so

1104
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:14,639
you know they just can't put it into

1105
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,230
their apps and so that's an issue I

1106
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,058
think the biggest threat right now for

1107
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,789
us there's a lot of apps there's a lot

1108
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,650
of like growing technologies or sensor

1109
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:24,329
technologies for soil moisture meters

1110
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,278
and we're seeing partnerships happen

1111
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:27,839
really rapidly and so I think that's

1112
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:30,659
going to be the one thing we look at is

1113
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,548
you know making constantly assessing how

1114
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,379
those parts is performing and looking at

1115
00:41:32,548 --> 00:41:38,358
it from a business perspective now that

1116
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,358
it's LLC not just university I

1117
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:49,979
so your screen up there says protected

1118
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:56,220
from dollar spot so what happens when

1119
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:57,960
the Golf Course does get so that if you

1120
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:01,289
go back to that they they can actually

1121
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,119
pick their threshold and so what you'd

1122
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:07,079
say then is okay maybe you have a weaker

1123
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,660
cultivar of grass and so you have to go

1124
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,920
to low-earth action thresholds and so

1125
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:13,649
that's the way we kind of make that

1126
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,730
happen and also to when they put in

1127
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,410
their interval for how long those

1128
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,240
fungicides last they know it's really

1129
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,409
high pressure don't put a 28-day

1130
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,169
interval if you know it's long in the

1131
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:23,219
last 14 days my counterpart at Wisconsin

1132
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,588
to is trying to take some of this

1133
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:27,989
growing degree day type environmental

1134
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:29,820
degradation modeling and research and

1135
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:31,949
applying it to fungicides and other

1136
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,039
types of control products soo so we can

1137
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:37,019
try to put this together with other

1138
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,029
products the bigger challenge there is P

1139
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:41,088
guys are easy and the PG air is gone it

1140
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,230
starts to where it starts to respond the

1141
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:45,299
fungicide is gone from the plant tissue

1142
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,490
it still may be having an impact on the

1143
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,500
pest and so there's give me a lot more

1144
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:52,799
dynamic there when you're dealing with

1145
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,050
the plant residual and the pest response

1146
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,880
to that that critical dose of that

1147
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,410
pesticide so it's a little bit more

1148
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:10,619
challenging than the PGR which is a

1149
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:14,759
pretty easy way into is there any way to

1150
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:17,010
track from these users she I was able to

1151
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,050
reduce my pesticide herbicide by just

1152
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:23,700
like whatever use over time yeah that's

1153
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,890
one thing we don't have yet and we

1154
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:27,719
talked about is you know we can pool

1155
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:29,909
data and they can look at how they're

1156
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,549
number either active ingredient has been

1157
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:34,289
reduced or they're aiq or whatever

1158
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,450
metric that you want to use to assess

1159
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:38,369
the risk and then we can rate how is my

1160
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:40,469
number changes over time but i'm more

1161
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:42,059
importantly may be more helpful is how

1162
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:44,399
are you doing relative to your peers in

1163
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:45,809
your area and so now if you're looking

1164
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,820
like well i'm really high and i'm really

1165
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:49,170
expensive and they're really low what

1166
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,150
are they doing differently how can I

1167
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:53,170
change my management so I think that

1168
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,240
that would be you know one way

1169
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,700
working on that right now with some of

1170
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,529
the the new organism from from a price

1171
00:43:57,699 --> 00:44:03,129
in a use perspective and your first

1172
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,900
question was the evaluation is not

1173
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,298
built-in yet we're just roaming through

1174
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,740
like Survey monkeys and and we're

1175
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:10,420
getting a lot of feedback through

1176
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:12,308
looking at how the products are being

1177
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,010
used in different regions too so we

1178
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:16,150
don't even have to use their bias

1179
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,650
results we can look at their actual

1180
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,930
product to use and so they can say

1181
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,298
they're good but I see you know they're

1182
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:23,769
low lumo use at this golf course may be

1183
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:25,780
a very different than that golf course

1184
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:43,769
and so sometimes it can be some bias and

1185
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:43,769
how to answer those surveys they're both

1186
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:32,980
so do you think universities we should

1187
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:34,809
have our own extension isn't writing dis

1188
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,119
articles anymore right it's doing

1189
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:38,798
podcasts like Frank does I do videos now

1190
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,510
where's building apps and we need the

1191
00:45:38,798 --> 00:45:42,579
infrastructure at universities to

1192
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,589
produce a diversity of media and I don't

1193
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:46,240
think we have it I keep pushing my

1194
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:48,009
department head to say we need a podcast

1195
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,019
booth where I can go in with good

1196
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,880
microphones and it's soundproof it's not

1197
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:53,469
me in an equity office with the fan

1198
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,240
blowing on from the air-conditioner vent

1199
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:56,858
so I think that that's definitely

1200
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:59,759
something that would make a lot of sense

1201
00:45:56,858 --> 00:46:02,650
I tried to go and turn off the app and

1202
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,859
this is kind of dysfunction within there

1203
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:06,910
that world I had to go external and pay

1204
00:46:05,858 --> 00:46:08,739
someone else

1205
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:10,690
to do it so I think having those

1206
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:12,818
resources would make extension a lot

1207
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,200
better then finding ways to fund

1208
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:15,788
ourselves right we're not going to get a

1209
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:18,308
lot of federal funding anymore or state

1210
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:19,780
funding so doing things like this your

1211
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:22,089
money milk is going directly back into

1212
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,490
my program support extension in the

1213
00:46:22,088 --> 00:46:26,318
support research and so finding revenue

1214
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,939
models I think one of the challenges

1215
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,949
though is you know that's where

1216
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,630
university is telling us to do I did

1217
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:32,409
that I'd like you be the poster child of

1218
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,920
it and what I do

1219
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:38,558
how many start an LLC so you know Leslie

1220
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,539
finances me it helps me out as a company

1221
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,859
owner and the university is some royalty

1222
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:43,960
back but they need to have some better

1223
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:45,608
way of figuring out how to raise money

1224
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,088
in extension so we can build these tools

1225
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:50,769
and it's not just charge for downloads

1226
00:46:49,088 --> 00:46:53,440
of a you know some kind of a net guide

1227
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:55,389
or some kind of a pamphlet and I think

1228
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,619
these tools are a really some way where

1229
00:46:55,389 --> 00:46:58,719
we can actually make a lot of money

1230
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:00,608
selling decision support tools and

1231
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,779
taking our brains and helping our

1232
00:47:00,608 --> 00:47:11,558
growers you know make the right

1233
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:15,309
decisions this has been a production of

1234
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:18,000
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

1235
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:18,000
