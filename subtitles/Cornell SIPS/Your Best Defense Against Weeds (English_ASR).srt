1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
Queens in lawns is the single most

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,298
popular complaint we get from most

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,490
homeowners and what what we need to get

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,469
people to understand is that the weeds

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,789
are invading because they're more

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,789
competitive and they're more competitive

7
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,129
because we are not creating a growing

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:20,009
environment that makes the grass more

9
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,259
competitive so if you've just got a few

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,800
weeds here and there hand weeding is

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,679
always an option this is where mowing

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,618
ties in with weeds because when you mow

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,238
too low the plants are less competitive

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,159
and when the plant when the grass plants

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,649
are less competitive the weeds are more

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,140
competitive if you can tolerate some

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,509
small patches of weeds in your lawn

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,670
you shouldn't have to really do much

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,589
about weed control but if you let the

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,780
weeds get too prolific then you'll have

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,670
more weeds than grass most people find

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,820
that objectionable so you want to find

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,149
that balance and a lot of that is mowing

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,590
properly feeding properly irrigating

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,109
selectively to keep the grass

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,809
competitive making sure you've got the

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,519
right grass for what it is you're

28
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,500
willing to do for it you have to set

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,020
your expectations and then recognize

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,040
your you know what you're willing to do

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,039
to get that long
