1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,639
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:09,529
University good afternoon everyone my

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,929
name is Bill Weldon and I'm a graduate

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:13,519
student at Cornell University in this

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,460
section of plant pathology and plant

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,989
microbiology my advisor is dr. David

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:24,140
godori and our lab largely focuses on

8
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:25,729
powdery mildews right now and almost all

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,939
of my graduate research is focused on

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,278
powdery mildew pops this was a

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,369
presentation that I gave in December of

12
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:37,850
2017 at the Cornell hot conference

13
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:41,149
hosted at SUNY Morrisville and I wanted

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,570
to record a copy of this presentation

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,549
and get posted online so that people

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,439
could access the PowerPoint and also

17
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,909
just have some audio nourish and help

18
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,799
hopefully explain some of the slides

19
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:54,879
because there are some animations with

20
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,839
some of the slides just in case as

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,280
anybody that's considering growing hops

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,250
or just currently growing hops might

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,840
find this presentation helpful so the

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,358
presentation title is differences in

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,969
managing the mildews and it's intended

26
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:09,649
to provide some help with staying out of

27
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:12,379
trouble with powdery mildew and downy

28
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:15,079
mildew which are both pathogens that we

29
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:17,449
have to worry about in hot production

30
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:19,129
quite frequently here up in the

31
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,399
Northeast and throughout the country

32
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,399
actually

33
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,869
[Music]

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,250
okay so why why care about downy and

35
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,379
powdery mildew well both pathogens are

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,049
ubiquitously distributed across New York

37
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:43,269
and the other eastern US states

38
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,460
throughout the Midwest and also on the

39
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:48,250
Pacific Northwest

40
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,609
their destruction capability is quite

41
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,489
high

42
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:55,090
they're capable of causing pretty

43
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:56,709
drastic yield losses they are major

44
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,960
factors and what pushed the New York cop

45
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:05,048
industry of the 20th century westward

46
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:07,239
and this was largely caused and any time

47
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,769
it's in the yard is the the losses are

48
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:14,348
caused through distortion browning and

49
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:16,480
reduction or variation in alpha acid

50
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:19,268
content so it could change the Alpha

51
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,250
acid profile for that given variety

52
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,840
which would also just make that variety

53
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,389
not acceptable for Brewers point of view

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,769
an example of when so powdery mildew

55
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,289
when it first arrived in Pacific

56
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,909
Northwest it caused over 10 million

57
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:37,659
dollars in losses in Washington that

58
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:40,239
first year and so it's it's really if it

59
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:41,769
it gets going in a yard it's really

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,189
quite capable of causing some pretty

61
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,530
significant you'll bust

62
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:50,889
so both pathogens are capable of causing

63
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,199
direct loss through modifying distorting

64
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,530
Brown and Hopkins but the downy mildew

65
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,909
can also have the additional impact of

66
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,120
causing systemic infection of the Hawk

67
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:03,159
room so the pathogen can get into the

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,889
crown of the Hotte plant and it can

69
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,469
exist there from season to season so

70
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,389
it's a systemic infection that persists

71
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:12,879
from year to year and this causes

72
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:14,650
indirect losses through the reduction in

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,079
the vigor of the hot planets so each

74
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,930
season the hot plant just gets less and

75
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:22,840
less vigorous until it gets the ultimate

76
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,269
point where one spring it would just

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,579
won't push you chopped push new new

78
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:31,409
shoots that following season and so it

79
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,409
can kill the hot plant that one

80
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,990
so the importance of properly

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,420
distinguishing between the two diseases

82
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,920
you might ask won't the management

83
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,769
approach be the same regardless of which

84
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,379
diseases present they're both pathogens

85
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,960
and I'm just gonna spray fungicides in

86
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,030
my yard if I see either and it doesn't

87
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,260
really matter whether I know which one

88
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,939
is actually there because I'm just gonna

89
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,849
be spraying anyways so what difference

90
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:58,939
does it make and that's not necessarily

91
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,859
the right approach and the way I think

92
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:03,829
of this is it's similar to being able to

93
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:09,140
properly respond to a fire versus a

94
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:11,740
tornado and so both are very destructive

95
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,119
natural disasters a fire in a tornado

96
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,639
but if you're sitting in your house and

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,189
you look out the window and you see a

98
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,099
tornado your response when you see a

99
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:23,600
tornado is to hightail it down into the

100
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,240
basement and that would be the right

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,850
move to make if there was in fact a

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,100
tornado outside of your house however if

103
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,379
you think you see a tornado you go to

104
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,939
the basement but in reality there's

105
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,129
actually a forest fire outside of your

106
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,920
house then by going to the basement

107
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,779
you've pretty much done the worst worst

108
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,340
thing that you could do in response to a

109
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:45,349
forest fire you you've trapped yourself

110
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:48,079
out in the basement and you're gonna end

111
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,020
up running around your pants on fire and

112
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,569
it's not gonna be a great situation and

113
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:55,639
I liken that to kind of differentiating

114
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,339
properly differentiating powdery and

115
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,449
downy mildew on between one another so

116
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,819
why care about the differences between

117
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,979
downy and powdery mildew well the two

118
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,659
organisms responsible for downing and

119
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,270
powdery belong two completely different

120
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,090
kingdoms so if you look at this figure

121
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:13,039
on the right here this is just a very

122
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,289
simple Tree of Life so you have like

123
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,189
your animals on one branch your plants

124
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,750
on another branch bacteria down here but

125
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:22,550
the branches that I want to point your

126
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,970
attention to are fungi you know my seeds

127
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,340
and the reason for that is that in fungi

128
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,960
so in the branch of fungi the organism

129
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:32,359
responsible for causing hot powdery

130
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:35,739
mildew is a fungus so it belongs here

131
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,810
and the fungus let's say is your fire

132
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,660
however the organism that causes hot

133
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,939
downy mildew is not a fungus

134
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,830
it's an LM I see and so this is your

135
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,290
tornado all right so these are two

136
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:50,089
completely different branches on the

137
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,420
tree of life these organisms are very

138
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:55,189
capable of causing destruction but the

139
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,780
reason this impacts you is that downy

140
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,879
mildew and powdery mildew generally

141
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,189
require different fungicides for good

142
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,250
specific control they're on different

143
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:06,889
branches and so the fungicides target

144
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,199
that target fungi those cellular

145
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,339
processes often aren't present in all my

146
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,589
seats because they're on a completely

147
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:14,659
different branch and so most modern

148
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,939
fungicides designed to control powdery

149
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,890
mildew do little to nothing to manage

150
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,719
downy mildew and vice versa

151
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,479
so it's critically important that you're

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,920
properly identifying what pathogen what

153
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,550
disease is present in your yard

154
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:32,540
because it really impacts how effective

155
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,430
your response is going to be so some

156
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:39,470
fungicides generally specific to downy

157
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:40,939
mildew are listed here on the left under

158
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,650
sides generally specific to powdery

159
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:47,120
mildew or on the right and so if you

160
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:48,859
were to think that you had powdery

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,439
mildew in your yard but you actually had

162
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,509
downy and then you decided to apply any

163
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,279
of these products on the right there

164
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,230
really would be very little efficacy and

165
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,609
kind of controlling disease because you

166
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,439
actually have damn email during her yard

167
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:05,439
and these these fungicides aren't

168
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,439
designed to target oh my seed organisms

169
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,329
they're

170
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,450
some cases of overlapping efficacy on

171
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:18,490
both powdery and downy mildew so one

172
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:20,229
example is pristine or Flint and these

173
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,329
products will provide downy mildew

174
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,480
suppression when used primarily for

175
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:27,310
powdery mildew control so there is there

176
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,930
are our few cases where you get a little

177
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,879
bit of overlapping control and maybe

178
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,370
your primarily sprang for powdery mildew

179
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,490
but you get some of this back back

180
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,709
handed control and Daniel do I want to

181
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,329
emphasize that these are examples these

182
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,430
products you always be used according to

183
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:44,500
the label in a given state and it's

184
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,090
important to check that any products

185
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,269
that you're using are actually labeled

186
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:53,319
for hops so some of these with a stir

187
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:57,729
seize on these slides I looked up as of

188
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,339
at least December of 2017 and the 2017

189
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,680
Cornell IPM production guide that they

190
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:05,529
are not labeled for use in New York but

191
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:11,769
they are put here as examples for people

192
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:14,259
that may be in different states so now

193
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,909
they're kind of the crux how to properly

194
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,849
differentiate between downy and powdery

195
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,410
mildew hopefully at this point we have a

196
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,510
little bit of an appreciation that these

197
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,270
diseases are capable of causing some

198
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,730
pretty drastic yield losses in your yard

199
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:30,129
and that it's important to be able to

200
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:33,340
proper properly differentiate the two

201
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,779
diseases between one another so now how

202
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,410
how to differentiate between downy

203
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,409
powdery mildew

204
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:45,100
what to physically look for in New York

205
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:48,489
in the case of downy mildew early in the

206
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,950
season the first infected shoots coming

207
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,980
out of ground are called basal spikes

208
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,110
when they are infected with Daniel do in

209
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,370
the case of powdery mildew these first

210
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:02,500
shoots are called flag shoots but the

211
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,710
basal spikes of downy mildew the very

212
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,850
characteristic kind of appearance of a

213
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:12,190
basal spike is a very chlorotic color so

214
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,500
slight yellowing in comparison to the

215
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,400
rest of the more kind of more vibrant

216
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,529
green of the healthy hot shoots there's

217
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,100
a general downward curling of the leaves

218
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:28,120
and the shoot appears very stunted and

219
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,409
so the distances between the points

220
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,629
where these two leaves are being

221
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:34,600
produced and this next set of leaves is

222
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:38,710
very very short and so the the shoot

223
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,240
appears very stunted if you look on the

224
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,450
underside of these leaves you're very

225
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,659
likely to see black purple purplish

226
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,950
masses of spores that are produced

227
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,240
exclusively on the underside of the

228
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,310
leaves and those are your downy mildew

229
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,830
spores but this is your very

230
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:56,500
characteristic basal spike which you

231
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,870
will see among the early shoots emerging

232
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,909
in the spring if downy mildew has

233
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,000
successfully overwintered in your yard

234
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:06,990
and is emerging on some of these new new

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,240
shoots from the case of powdery mildew

236
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,419
nope so here here are a couple more

237
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,990
examples of basal spikes in your yard or

238
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:19,899
in a yard so this is a basal spike this

239
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,610
is a basal spike here but then there are

240
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,740
other instances of some taller shoots

241
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,879
maybe in the background here where

242
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,350
they're not quite as stunted and they

243
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,299
the basal spikes are just very chlorotic

244
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,340
they're very yellow and they once it

245
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:37,059
once you've seen one on the yard they

246
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,460
tend to be quite noticeable you just

247
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:43,039
have to kind of be aware and cognizant

248
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,440
of what you're looking for these base

249
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,899
Spike's can also form on your lateral

250
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,370
branches of hops should downy mildew be

251
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,839
present in your yard at the time when

252
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,399
lateral branches are being produced and

253
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,790
those are called aerial spikes and they

254
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,708
have very character characteristics as

255
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,490
their basal spikes except they're

256
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:02,629
forming on your lateral branches and so

257
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,360
there they could be higher up in the

258
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:09,620
canopy but they're again those new buds

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,470
that are pushing and you get these very

260
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,778
chlorotic leaves with down lower stunted

261
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,870
growth they curl downwards and you're

262
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:21,559
you'll likely see masses of damning

263
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,980
mildew on the underside of the leaves so

264
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,888
in the case of powdery mildew they're

265
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,278
termed flag chutes and these flag shoots

266
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:33,759
again emerge early spring when the hops

267
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:38,509
start breaking ground and the buds that

268
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:41,480
emerge infected with powdery mildew up

269
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:44,539
here as this picture to the right where

270
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,870
the shoot is very strikingly white the

271
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,189
leaves are also typically stunted but

272
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,839
the major kind of defining

273
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,910
characteristic of a flag shoot is just

274
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,740
the striking white appearance in

275
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,208
comparison to all of the green healthy

276
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,909
tissue that doesn't have powdery mildew

277
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:01,039
surrounding it and that's that's where

278
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:07,309
the term flag shoot comes from it sticks

279
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:09,559
out like flag one other difference

280
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:12,169
between downy and powdery mildew is the

281
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,568
coloration of the spores so downy mildew

282
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:16,789
has very darkly pigmented spores and

283
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:19,370
this results in clusters of purple to

284
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:22,039
black colonies on the leaf these

285
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,409
colonies exist exclusively on the

286
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,360
underside of the weave which is very

287
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:28,338
it's a very defining characteristic of

288
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,419
downy mildew so if you're questioning

289
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,050
whether you have downy mildew in your

290
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:34,159
yard or not and you see spores being

291
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:36,169
produced on the upper side of the leaf

292
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,969
that's kind of a deterrent and maybe

293
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,919
makes you think that maybe it's not

294
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,079
downy mildew you should be only saying

295
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,500
spores on the underside of the leaves in

296
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,719
the case of downy alternatively for

297
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,360
powdery mildew they produce transparent

298
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,790
non-pigmented spores and this results in

299
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,740
masses of clear spores that when you're

300
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,779
looking at it macroscopically appears

301
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,149
white fluffy colonies on the leaf

302
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,339
and these colonies can be produced both

303
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:04,279
on the upper surface and the lower

304
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:07,190
surface of your leaves the hop cones

305
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,199
also the case for Daddy mill do on your

306
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,620
stems pretty much any green above ground

307
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,180
tissue

308
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,710
um can harbor these these organisms so

309
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,539
these are some of your downy mildew

310
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,210
sports you can see that they're darkly

311
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:23,240
pigmented and when you start looking at

312
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:25,970
these with your naked eye so okay in

313
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,269
comparison this is these are your spores

314
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,940
produced by powdery mildew and they are

315
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,340
not pigmented they kind of appear in

316
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,980
these little stacks of bead-like spores

317
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,410
and when you look at that microscope

318
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,940
macroscopically with with your eye what

319
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:43,939
you see is kind of a white fluffy cotton

320
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,680
and so here are the examples of what you

321
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,500
might see when you just look at it

322
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,179
visually again notice how downy mildew

323
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,590
is these all these spores are on the

324
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:56,539
underside of the leaf they are black to

325
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,100
purple and so they are much darker

326
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,769
typically than your powdery mildew

327
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,480
colonies and when you look at the

328
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:05,059
powdery mildew leaf it's very strikingly

329
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,279
white it's a little bit fluffier it kind

330
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:08,750
of looks like snow if if it's on circus

331
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,809
the weaves some of the older colonies

332
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,879
can look a little bit matte grey if

333
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:17,209
they're if they're old and not producing

334
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,379
any new spores but typically the thing

335
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,210
that gives away powdery mildew is the

336
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:26,029
white fluffy colonies on here Crede

337
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:28,850
green tissue so we're on the plant is

338
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,589
the disease found for downy mildew and I

339
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,810
said this before the spores are produced

340
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,490
exclusively on the underside of the

341
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,929
leaves and that is a big big

342
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,240
differentiation between downy and

343
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,759
powdery mildew the lesions will be

344
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,509
angular which means that if you look at

345
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,399
a leaf and you can see the leaf things

346
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,679
kind of extending out across the leaf

347
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,049
the lesions will be trapped in between

348
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,569
those veins they can't extend past those

349
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:56,359
veins and so those veins kind of trap

350
00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:00,050
the little lesions into angular kind of

351
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,210
shapes and for downy mildew the growth

352
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:04,969
can spread into the hop crumb and cause

353
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,180
that systemic infection for powdery

354
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,460
mildew the

355
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,469
spores can be found on all green plant

356
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,230
tissue and this includes both sides the

357
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,730
leaves and so if you're seeing something

358
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,778
that's forming on the top side of the

359
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,610
leaf and you're trying to differentiate

360
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,778
between downy and powdery that's a good

361
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,659
indication that you might be dealing

362
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,549
with powdery mildew and again it cannot

363
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,469
cause systemic infection of the crumbs

364
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:30,899
and that is only only something worried

365
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:33,810
about however in both cases the dormant

366
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:36,559
buds that exist sort of just beneath the

367
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:38,849
soil line during the winter can be

368
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,278
colonized by both downy and powdery

369
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,350
mildew and that's how your basal spikes

370
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,088
in the case of downy mildew and your

371
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:50,040
flag shoots in case of powdery mildew

372
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:53,130
emergence room so this is a picture

373
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,899
example of the angular motions that I

374
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:58,100
was talking about for downy mildew and

375
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,389
so you see your leaf veins and then

376
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,459
there's even smaller leaf veins that are

377
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:05,069
progressing through the spaces between

378
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:07,559
the larger ones and those are trapping

379
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,650
your downy mildew colonies into very

380
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:13,500
angular shapes here's what it looks like

381
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:17,129
from the top and again so the spores are

382
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,919
only only underside the leaf on the top

383
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:23,399
will start to show slight discoloration

384
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:26,429
that might turn necrotic brown color as

385
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,708
the leaf gets older but they are in in

386
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:31,049
line with where the colonies are forming

387
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,549
on the underside of the leaf and so

388
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,490
that's that's a response to the colonies

389
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:37,109
forming on the underside of the leaf

390
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,990
here's another case this is a slightly

391
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,940
older downy mildew colony again you can

392
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,278
see those angry angular lesions but they

393
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,100
are turning more more of a brown color

394
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,500
because the colonies are much older it

395
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,389
caused more damage to the leaf as time

396
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,759
has passed in case of powdery mildew you

397
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,789
this is just an example of the very

398
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,828
white fluffy spores that Shema in the

399
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:04,670
colonies that you might see if you're

400
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:07,470
coming across powdery mildew new yard

401
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,079
and they are caused by the clear spores

402
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,179
that build up and the amounts of

403
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,289
hundreds of thousands and appear white

404
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,839
when you're just looking at it with your

405
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,789
eye they are capable of spreading to any

406
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,250
green above-ground plant tissue so here

407
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:24,599
it is on a hot comb

408
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:27,449
and in the case of downy mildew it can

409
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,459
also cause the brown discoloration it's

410
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,960
it's a little bit of a darker kind of

411
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,419
reddish brown in the case of downy

412
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,129
mildew in the case of powdery mildew

413
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,720
it's more of your traditional kind of

414
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:39,058
just necrosis and you'll probably be

415
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,528
able to see some of the white powdery

416
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:45,269
growth on the cone but the easiest way

417
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:48,898
to identify these pathogens is not by

418
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:49,649
differentiating how your cone looks you

419
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:53,908
should have

420
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:55,408
leaf kind of damage harboring either

421
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,059
downy mildew or powdery mildew around

422
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,830
and that's that's much easier to

423
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,298
differentiate than trying to decide on

424
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:04,349
which pathogen is causing a problem

425
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:07,230
based on how the cones are working so

426
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:12,329
one note about varietal resistance for

427
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:14,399
hot downy mildew is that there are two

428
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:16,558
ways as I said that hop down T mildew

429
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:19,888
can cause damage to a plant it can

430
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:23,339
affect your hop cones and cause a direct

431
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:25,349
you loss through damaged vodka and then

432
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,750
it can cause the systemic infection that

433
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:29,548
causes a year-to-year reduction in the

434
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,679
yield potential of that plant as it gets

435
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:33,500
weaker from year to year from having

436
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,048
been systemically infected and that

437
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,898
creates kind of this spectrum of

438
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:43,128
resistance across plants where some

439
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:46,018
plants may be resistant to the foliar

440
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:48,628
aspect of downy mildew but susceptible

441
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,759
to the systemic infection or susceptible

442
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:55,619
to both foliar and systemic resistant to

443
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:57,990
both or whichever the last one the

444
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,788
resistant to the foliar are susceptible

445
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,200
to the Foley or resistant to a systemic

446
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,450
infection and so it breaks out into

447
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,159
these four quadrants and really kind of

448
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,278
results in more of a spectrum than a

449
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,649
clear-cut definition of this variety for

450
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:12,058
Danny mildew is resistant because there

451
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:16,349
is there are so many factors at play

452
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:17,970
that it unless it's completely resistant

453
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:21,628
to both full ear infection and your

454
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,950
crown systemic infection then there's

455
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:25,788
going to be kind of spectrum above the

456
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,379
resistance associated with that variety

457
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:32,638
when considering the vara varietal

458
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:33,359
resistance to powdery mildew again there

459
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,209
are some variety

460
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:39,329
that are published as resistant to

461
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,890
powdery mildew in the US and then there

462
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:43,109
are some that have recently lost

463
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,850
resistance in Pacific Northwest and so

464
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:47,519
the varieties nugget and Cascade have

465
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:50,480
strains of powdery mildew that have been

466
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,039
found out there where the strains are

467
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,980
kind of adapted to grow better than they

468
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,139
normally would be able to so that

469
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,569
resistance has recently lost in stiff

470
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,070
northwest and these are varieties that

471
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:03,980
are worth paying attention to on the

472
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:06,899
East Coast because it's worth knowing

473
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,700
and tracking whether these strains

474
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,419
president Pacific Northwest I've made

475
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,419
their way eastward

476
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,739
so another way to properly

477
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:19,648
the disease is to know the optimal

478
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:23,139
conditions for downy and powdery mildew

479
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:25,959
there are basically kinds of weather

480
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:30,548
that favor one disease over the or the

481
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,558
other and so typically you get general

482
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:34,528
seasons that favor high prevalence of

483
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,298
either downy mildew or powdery mildew

484
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:39,398
four downy mildew these are your rainy

485
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:42,368
seasons so it's strongly favored by wet

486
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:44,528
rainy conditions seasons of high

487
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:50,499
humidity and long due periods are also

488
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:51,848
conducive for downy mildew and spores

489
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,669
are pigmented there on the inner side of

490
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:57,970
the leaf which these are conditions

491
00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:00,879
conducive for high humidity if this is

492
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:03,220
relevant to you this would the 2017

493
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:06,339
growing season was a very conducive

494
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,929
season where we got a lot of rain there

495
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:10,259
were long periods of leaf wetness and

496
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:13,298
the downy mildew spore actually requires

497
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:15,399
wet leaf wetness

498
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:16,960
it requires moisture on the surface of

499
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:19,928
the leaf in order to be able to infect

500
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,069
the host and so that was a very very

501
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:25,778
favorable growth season for downy mildew

502
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:28,479
in the case of powdery mildew it's

503
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:30,159
favored during seasons of temperate or

504
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:33,729
more dry conditions it doesn't require

505
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,619
water to infect the plant so

506
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,479
theoretically every day is a potential

507
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:39,038
infection period but the conditions that

508
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:41,308
are most favorable for powdery mildew

509
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,269
are kind of your temperate overcast days

510
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:45,308
where there's not direct sunlight

511
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:48,128
because those spores are not pigmented

512
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:53,048
the Sun can damage the spores and then

513
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:55,778
kill them off the 2016 growing season in

514
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:57,700
New York was or was an example of a

515
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:59,558
season that was favored favorable for

516
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,679
powdery mildew it was much drier than

517
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:08,528
2017 and we saw many more cases of

518
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:10,840
powdery mildew that year so now now that

519
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:13,298
you've properly identified what disease

520
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,398
is in your yard it's important to know

521
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:19,839
how to properly manage of downy and

522
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:22,329
powdery mildew so kind of the first and

523
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,009
foremost way to make your life easier is

524
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:26,138
to choose resistant varieties when

525
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,700
possible this has to be taken in

526
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,129
consideration with varieties that are in

527
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,470
May

528
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,900
on the brewing industry obviously but

529
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:36,048
when possible at least always give

530
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,360
consideration to the resistance or the

531
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:39,740
susceptibility of the varieties that

532
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,928
you're planting in your yards that you

533
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,130
go in with realistic expectations of how

534
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,850
intensive your disease management

535
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,950
program is going to be if this is

536
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:51,589
especially important for organic

537
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,660
production and it will also guide your

538
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:54,678
scouting intensity regardless of whether

539
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,660
you're growing organically or

540
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,538
conventionally as well as your spray

541
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:03,460
program intensity because it will inform

542
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:06,440
you kind of how how at-risk are you for

543
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:11,000
for infection of both downy or powdery

544
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,909
mildew so you should you should be

545
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,690
scouting as soon as shoots emerge and

546
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:21,559
scout as often as fees as feasible for

547
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,210
your operation I know this can be tough

548
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,460
and some critical scouting periods for

549
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,600
downy mildew are at shoot emergence at

550
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,919
the start of the season because those

551
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,769
are when you're gonna identify your

552
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,770
basal spikes and you would want to rogue

553
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:35,058
those out at the time of shoot training

554
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,759
this is another time that's very

555
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:39,288
important because if you're growing tips

556
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,129
of your shoots are infected with downy

557
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:45,589
mildew they will become stunted they

558
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:50,480
will stop growing upwards and they will

559
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:52,069
likely fall from the trellis which will

560
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,190
require you to have to retrain shoots

561
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:57,019
which could result in a yield loss just

562
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,210
basically by improper it messes with

563
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:02,029
your training time at the time of

564
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,720
production of lateral branches so those

565
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:07,158
aerial spikes that we mentioned those

566
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,690
can become a problem during the time

567
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,360
production of lateral branches and say

568
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,970
you once got well trying to start

569
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,709
because this can basically cause your

570
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,538
lateral branches to be killed off which

571
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,880
would result in a yield loss because

572
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:22,990
those would be branches that would not

573
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,760
result in forming proper Hopkins and

574
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,440
then you should also be scouting one

575
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,359
week prior to bloom through four weeks

576
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,630
post bloom because this is the period

577
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:36,349
when the hop cones are atmo are most at

578
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,330
risk for become

579
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,918
infected with downy mildew so the cones

580
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:41,659
are most susceptible during this time

581
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,340
and if they become infected during this

582
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,110
time they're gonna result in the

583
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:47,959
greatest amount of distortion the

584
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:51,219
greatest fluctuation away from the norm

585
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,419
of the alpha acid level your beta is

586
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,038
away from whatever that variety should

587
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:56,538
be behaving as will be most affected

588
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:02,029
them if they get infected during this

589
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:03,980
time for powdery again scout as soon as

590
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:07,490
shoots emerge and scout as often as

591
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,440
possible the two major critical scouting

592
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,940
periods for powdery mildew are at shoot

593
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,320
emergence at the start of the season so

594
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,870
you should be scouting forget the flag

595
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,269
shoots and be rolling those out should

596
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:19,579
you find any and then one week prior to

597
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:21,440
bloom through the three weeks post bloom

598
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:23,689
because this is the period when the hop

599
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,330
cones are most susceptible to powdery

600
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:29,570
mildew infection and the cones are most

601
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:31,298
affected and most result in kind of the

602
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:34,038
greatest amount of distortion and

603
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:40,038
improper alpha and beta acid levels in

604
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:42,798
cones so it's easy to tell you just a

605
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:45,710
scout and that's a very big thing to say

606
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,658
so hopefully those times are helpful and

607
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,140
then also here's a general scouting

608
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:52,400
approach so when disease pressure is low

609
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,809
you should be scouting one to two

610
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,788
hundred plants every time you Scout and

611
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:58,690
they should be evenly dispersed among

612
00:25:55,788 --> 00:26:00,950
varieties and throughout your yard

613
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:03,019
should pay special attention to the

614
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,509
basal foliage as well as any young still

615
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:09,099
developing hop cones and leaves your

616
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:11,298
basal foliage that's a very conducive

617
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:13,519
microclimate for the development of

618
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:15,558
downy and powdery mildew so it's

619
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,359
protected from sunlight often on the

620
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:20,019
humidity levels a little bit higher so

621
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:23,750
that would favor your downy mildew and

622
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:26,509
this is also just a part of the yard a

623
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:30,169
level of the yard we're very young kind

624
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:32,629
of actively growing hop tissue is being

625
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:35,090
produced and the youngest hop tissue is

626
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,789
typically the most susceptible part of

627
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:41,359
the hop plant for downy and powdery

628
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:43,009
mildew or infection for downy look for

629
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,359
the basal spikes and dark spores on the

630
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,308
underside of the leaves for powdery look

631
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:49,539
for your white powdery colonies and

632
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:49,539
especially on your young

633
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,420
any kind of suspect shoots or leaves

634
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,940
that you might see in your yard you can

635
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:01,060
kind of do an at-home Hema chamber to

636
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,920
try and cause these organisms to produce

637
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,200
spores which are very characteristic

638
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,690
giveaways for what disease you might be

639
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,759
dealing with so remove a question we'll

640
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,549
shoot and place it inside of a ziploc

641
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,890
bag with a damp paper towel for downy

642
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:16,599
you want to store this bag at room

643
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,890
temperature in the dark because they

644
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,219
spoil you late or in the dark and that

645
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,410
will be the easiest way to confirm

646
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,269
whether or not it's downy mildew for

647
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,370
powdery stored at room temperature in a

648
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,289
spot that gets daily light-dark cycles

649
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:31,089
because that is associated with how

650
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:33,519
powdery mildew produces its pores and

651
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:35,740
the end goal is just to try and get the

652
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,289
chute in question to produce spores

653
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,349
because that's the easiest way to figure

654
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:44,500
out what what organism what disease you

655
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:45,879
may be dealing with so check for

656
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,730
production of spores after one or two

657
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:54,799
days obviously

658
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,660
fungicides are very crucial and control

659
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,450
of both of these diseases and it's

660
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,370
important to know your fungicides so

661
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,798
it's crucial to know which fungicides

662
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:06,109
apply to downy mildew or to powdery

663
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:08,660
mildew you can check the label if you're

664
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:11,389
unsure sometimes it won't specifically

665
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:14,600
say downy mildew or or specifically

666
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,820
powdery mildew but in those cases and

667
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,349
often will say other organisms that if

668
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:20,779
you do a quick Google search you could

669
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,639
figure out whether that's a fungus or a

670
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:26,058
gnome I see if we think back to that

671
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:30,230
tree of life the fire versus the tornado

672
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:31,668
and if there's a bunch of my seats

673
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,250
listed on that label it's likely

674
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:36,409
applying to oh my seats which is it as a

675
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,538
downy mildew organism but just check the

676
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:40,039
label if you're unsure and be sure that

677
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:41,509
you're using the right fungicide to

678
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:44,000
target the organism that you think is in

679
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,158
your yard there are many applications

680
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,779
decisions to make the on label I'm

681
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,789
seeming to think about the efficacy of

682
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,980
the fungicide the potential for

683
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:53,960
resistance so maybe saving your big guns

684
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,990
for just the most crucial times during

685
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,340
the growing season the longevity

686
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,009
retention redistribution of these zones

687
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:02,899
so those decisions just beyond deciding

688
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:06,230
what fungicide product do you want to

689
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,030
use like I just said saved a big guns

690
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,919
for most critical management periods in

691
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:13,819
the case of powdery mildew this would be

692
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,679
around bloom that was one two three week

693
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:18,168
period that we were talking about so

694
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,460
your quintic your pristine again make

695
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:20,080
sure that these are products that are

696
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,450
labeled

697
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,889
for use in your state dining mildew how

698
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,620
this could be remiss plus phosphorus

699
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,320
acids and pro these are typically kind

700
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:31,759
of big guns for control of these

701
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,470
pathogen so you want to save them very

702
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:38,450
much critical critical times where you

703
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:41,000
need great control there are some shared

704
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,590
cultural practices for both downy and

705
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,788
mildew you downy mildew and powdery

706
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:48,199
mildew that are kind of the legwork

707
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:52,279
quote-unquote to make your fungicides

708
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,679
work better so if you do this stuff it's

709
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,779
easier to keep these diseases under

710
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,900
control and your fungicides or have

711
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:01,359
greater efficacy if kind of these

712
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,450
cultural practices are part of

713
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:08,139
management approach some pruning and/or

714
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,519
crowning are is a strategy that you do

715
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,750
if they started the growing season to

716
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,190
remove some of those buds that may have

717
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:18,789
overwintered with powdery or downy

718
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,230
mildew on them and so this would cut

719
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,200
back your first flush of growth

720
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,370
essentially that may have shoots that

721
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,259
would eventually become your basal

722
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:28,629
spikes in the case of downy or flag

723
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,849
shoots in case of powdery and we would

724
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,290
kill those those off and so then

725
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:35,709
hopefully that second flush of growth

726
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,539
that comes from deeper in the soil does

727
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,490
not have any powder your downy mildew on

728
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:42,399
it and you're left with only healthy hop

729
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:47,319
tissue the training time is important

730
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:49,480
because it gets the shoots that you want

731
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:53,319
cut off the ground and away from all the

732
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,450
basal foliage and then this allows you

733
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,909
to focus on cleaning up that basal

734
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,980
foliage which can Harbor and be kind of

735
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:03,610
a microclimate ideal for development

736
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:08,769
both of these diseases stripping the

737
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:10,178
lower leaves is an option and so guys

738
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:13,058
have some photos associated with this

739
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:17,880
and so pruning these might be your first

740
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:20,558
flush of growth cut these back you might

741
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,390
be able to remove either the basal

742
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,230
spikes or the five shoots that emerge in

743
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,820
this flush of growth training times

744
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,798
picture associated with that and then

745
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,149
here's a picture to help describe what

746
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,089
we mean by stripping the lower leaves

747
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,220
you're breaking the green bridge so all

748
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:38,289
that basal foliage the hot tissue

749
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,910
growing along the soil line that might

750
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:45,009
connect each plant kind of bridge that

751
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:48,190
distance between the plants so this

752
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:49,900
distance right here we're splitting that

753
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,120
up and we're also increasing airflow

754
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,419
through the yard stripping the lower

755
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,159
leaves is not recommended for young

756
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:59,320
yards so your first your second your

757
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:04,600
yards and also some varieties don't

758
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:07,720
respond well to losing their first three

759
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:10,000
feet of wee foliage so you're left less

760
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,200
vigorous varieties might might this

761
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,740
might not be something that you'd want

762
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,769
to do for them

763
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,048
and here here's an instance of what I

764
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:21,210
mean by the green bridge and so you can

765
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:23,369
see this hot tissue going along the soil

766
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,769
line and effectively connecting these

767
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:27,898
two plants to one another and so it

768
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,908
could feasibly happen where powdery

769
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,798
mildew just kind of crawls along spreads

770
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:34,590
from leaf to leaf and all of a sudden

771
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,879
you have it in this plant and so

772
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:39,599
anything you can do to break that cream

773
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,299
bridge is good some good sources of

774
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,609
information to reference the Cornell

775
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:46,379
integrated hops production guide is put

776
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,928
out each year and this is New York

777
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,380
specific information regarding labeled

778
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:54,899
chemistry's so each year that list gets

779
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,250
updated and changes slightly it's

780
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:58,949
available through the Cornell bookstore

781
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:02,579
and this is not relevant

782
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:06,240
I guess the relevance now as this is

783
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:08,879
posted is that the 2018 Edition is

784
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,308
available there's also the field guide

785
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,380
for integrated pest management hops the

786
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:15,599
link can be found on the USA hops

787
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,750
website with the research and technical

788
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:21,990
tab I think if you do a google search of

789
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:24,390
this title you can find it on a handful

790
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,190
of different websites a link to it but

791
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:29,370
that's one that has worked for me past

792
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:32,370
the 2017 Michigan hop management guide

793
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:33,558
they did a very very nice job there at

794
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:36,028
Michigan State University Extension

795
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,950
that's very good

796
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:41,069
management guide another one for the

797
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:43,288
East Coast and then one of my projects

798
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:47,099
that I've been working on I put together

799
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:49,679
a hops web page for Cornell and so we

800
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:54,389
have that here so if you google search

801
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,759
Cornell sips hops or follow this URL

802
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:03,149
here you'll be taken to the hops page

803
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:08,039
for Cornell and here we've up up loaded

804
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:09,598
some outreach content some disease

805
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,300
management stuff so management of hot

806
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,109
downy mildew managing the mildew so kind

807
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,490
of a pared down version of this talk

808
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:19,259
five considerations for ever planning

809
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:23,368
your first hop management of powdery

810
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,109
mildew and this is something that we

811
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:27,100
hope to continually update as more

812
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:31,440
articles are put together that is

813
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:34,029
where this talk will be uploaded to and

814
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,900
is hopefully just going to become kind

815
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:42,100
of a reliable source of hop related

816
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:44,200
content so with that thank you for your

817
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,059
time feel free to email me if you have

818
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,299
any questions my email is on the first

819
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:52,329
slide

820
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:56,380
it's ww3 9/5 at cornell edu and with

821
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:58,659
that yeah thank you here's my email

822
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,450
again and I hope you have a good day

823
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:05,049
thank you this has been a production of
