1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,118
and we want to make sure that that data

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,939
is available

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,759
to commute you know to these breeders

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,140
and research communities also folks that

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,800
are engaged in in Industry developing

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,980
new technologies like Kemp Crete and I

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,558
mean we've heard some really cool

10
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,019
applications for hemp material fiber

11
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:44,640
different kind of fibrous geofabrics

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,700
it's incredible where this where this

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,739
crop can go and so we we feel very

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,039
privileged to be part of the community

15
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,738
and to support support these efforts

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,039
where we can my specific title is

17
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,259
research geneticist currently I think

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,159
you know where we can really focus our

19
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:07,200
efforts is as Zach mentioned these

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,900
multi-state evaluation efforts and so we

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,939
have a couple great collaborators here

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,700
Stephen belush

23
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,459
Ernie Siebert uh from Alabama and Oregon

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,200
State and also Larry smart and Chris

25
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,039
smart from Cornell

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,478
um really appreciate uh and

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,600
oh yeah yeah and uh so new from uh from

28
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,000
Alabama a m as well also many other

29
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,239
great collaborators Shelby Ellison here

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,099
uh David suchoff a great research

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,978
community and hopefully everyone's able

32
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,539
to kind of reach out and chat with some

33
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,519
of these researchers

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,640
um so I think evaluations of this

35
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,099
material across States because some

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,460
material might do very well in New York

37
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,739
but perform poorly in Oregon City or

38
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,719
Alabama and vice versa there might be

39
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,938
some material that looks horrible in New

40
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,519
York but looks great in Alabama for

41
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,719
Growers uh in the in that Southeast

42
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,179
region

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,459
um so I think that characterization is

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,979
is so vitally important of this

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,800
germplasm it's coming back skating you

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,080
know accessions every day um sometimes

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,040
hundreds of accessions will come in in a

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,500
lot and so it's a big uh big task to do

49
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,679
a thorough evaluation we're trying as as

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,500
hard as we can and to grow out these

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,659
materials and evaluate for many

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,598
different traits including fiber quality

53
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,520
grain quality and the one that is

54
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,780
probably most pressing is secondary

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,719
metabolites looking at THC levels and

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,419
then as as a

57
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:51,120
as a geneticist I'm curious

58
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:54,719
what which of these germplasm accession

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:59,580
which is this germplasm has stable and

60
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:02,039
low THC levels across across these

61
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,099
different states so that we can use

62
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,039
those varieties for back Crossing into

63
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,979
this diverse term plasm so that we can

64
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,400
have regulatory compliant material

65
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:16,919
that's available for distribution

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,599
and so I also want to highlight another

67
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:23,219
study that we're doing with Chris smart

68
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,959
and Larry's group and Nicole goche and

69
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,840
Bob Pierce down at the University of

70
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,878
Kentucky and that is looking at

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,739
resistance to a bunch of really

72
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,979
important pathogens that includes

73
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,200
powdery mildew septoria downy mildew and

74
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,579
fusarium petite and so we think that

75
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,280
that's going to be a really important

76
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,920
data to get out to growers in the

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
research and Industry communities as

78
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,780
well if there are other traits that we

79
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,939
that we haven't mentioned that you think

80
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,560
would be really important I know that

81
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,259
there is an earlier question about

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
looking at stem

83
00:03:54,259 --> 00:04:00,179
THC concentration that I think we're

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,060
we're open and willing to discuss

85
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,519
um looking at additional traits uh this

86
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,860
year we started a root study as well

87
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,438
because some folks mentioned that Roots

88
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,400
were very important and looking at like

89
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:17,399
root biomass root morphology

90
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,439
and so your comments help inform where

91
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,198
our research goes and what kind of data

92
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,978
gets posted onto Grant Global so we're

93
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,379
very excited about this very excited to

94
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:30,478
tell folks what we're up to I don't

95
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,639
think our our trials are going to be

96
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,399
part of today's activities but if you'd

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,800
like to see them at some point reach out

98
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,978
to us and we can take you on a tour of

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,620
that of our research trials just a

100
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:46,860
little bit a couple miles away from here

101
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,978
um and I want to thank Larry and the

102
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,620
Cornell team for for hosting this event

103
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:55,500
and um and please reach out with

104
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,879
questions at any time and good seeing

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,879
this group all right thank you

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,939
first nationally in fiber production or

107
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,899
sustainable construction materials

108
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,360
there is a lot of interest in Chinese uh

109
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,659
hemp coming in from China

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,060
which grows very well grows very tall

111
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,759
flowers very late

112
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,959
so it's good for fiber production

113
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,620
but

114
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,299
every Chinese cultivar or variety I call

115
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,600
them land races

116
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,939
that we have tested has tested hot

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,220
we know the genetics of THC production

118
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,560
we know why they test hot

119
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,720
because the genes for THC production

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,060
have not been bred out of those Chinese

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
varieties

122
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,780
we have done that in our breeding

123
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,478
program and Louise is going to talk

124
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,159
about those lines as well as all the

125
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,418
varieties that you see here that he is

126
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,419
evaluating

127
00:05:54,418 --> 00:06:00,180
uh I think we if we can if you can think

128
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:03,478
about how we can get people moving down

129
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,600
to our next stop which is down by the

130
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:09,319
farm Droid there then we'll get get our

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,280
blood flowing here a little bit chilly

132
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,719
but Luis has uh about 40 minutes to

133
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,299
describe all of this stuff here well 30

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,280
minutes plus questions

135
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,079
thanks so much Larry uh first of all I'd

136
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,239
like to pass on some samples for you

137
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,939
guys to see

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,918
so those are the generics or the seeds

139
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,899
that we are uh we have currently our

140
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,120
general classroom collection uh you can

141
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,939
see different seat sizes and what

142
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,560
happens when you extract uh The Hemp

143
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,360
Hearts from it and then you get the

144
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,639
hearts and the holes you can also see

145
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,259
pressed oil and you will see this Gunk

146
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,660
at the bottom is because it was whole

147
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,060
seed press oil it was it wasn't just the

148
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,400
it wasn't just the heart sorry

149
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,899
um so just pass around so people can

150
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,299
take a look at those

151
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,638
um but yeah so today I want to cover a

152
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,740
small flow trial which encompasses 12

153
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,038
fiber cultivars you can see on my right

154
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,079
and 18 dual purpose cultivars in total

155
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,199
we have a 26 cultivar some of them are

156
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,379
trialled in both dual and fiber to see

157
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,840
which protein system works best for them

158
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,719
um so first of all I started my third

159
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,579
last year with this question who here is

160
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,120
wearing or having any fire derived

161
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,120
product

162
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,180
thank you so much

163
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:26,598
thank you

164
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,560
um so yeah I here I think I'm very

165
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,599
confident that most of you know what

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,418
Empire is where it comes from and

167
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,978
everything but just a quick reminder so

168
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,439
make sure that we're on the same page it

169
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,538
comes from the outer the cortex which is

170
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,240
like the bus called bust

171
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:59,639
um and then the inner the inner Woody

172
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,660
part also called The Herd is what is

173
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,280
used for uh hemp crate or pull for paper

174
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,620
um you can use with animal padding right

175
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,138
so to make sure that we're all on the

176
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,598
same page right so I don't wanna

177
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,478
tell you like how to grow Fiverr

178
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,639
specifically or like the anatomy or the

179
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,680
physiology of hemp I think you some of

180
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,660
you already know more or less what that

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
is but rather I would like to tell you

182
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,840
the importance of what we're doing right

183
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,758
now and with that I think the best

184
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,658
start from the very beginning

185
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,060
uh in 1912 Mr Dewey was the first well

186
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:39,240
this is claimed to be the first hemp

187
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,000
reader uh he started working in around

188
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,139
Minnesota Kentucky and those cultivars

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,600
were named based on like the origin of

190
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,759
the ocean so there's kimmington Kentucky

191
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,519
Minnesota Washington

192
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,819
jimington China or Chinta or something

193
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,539
like that China Washington and it's

194
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,060
Fairington which is a Italian land race

195
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:05,399
and a Washington originated population

196
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:09,299
so you can tell

197
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:12,299
the assessment of ham General classroom

198
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:14,699
has happened long time ago goes way back

199
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,399
and he already evaluated multiple

200
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,100
aeroplasm for different Origins so you

201
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,278
can tell that what we're doing is not

202
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:28,500
nothing new but rather necessary

203
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:30,778
so later in 1925 despite the prohibition

204
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,600
that happened in the U.S that doesn't

205
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:37,500
mean that hemp reading is stopped he

206
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,560
carry on in Germany is a researcher

207
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,620
called Gustav breadman he worked on

208
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,179
improving past content and it was very

209
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,560
interesting reading this paper because

210
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,079
in Germany I had to translate a little

211
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,458
bit so hopefully I'm conveying the

212
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,620
information

213
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,359
um he was able to prove this past

214
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,659
content that I was talking about from

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,019
nine percent to 30 so we're talking

216
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:03,778
about 2.5 to 3 full increase in bass

217
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,759
content at the same time all the

218
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:10,200
researchers were able to find the first

219
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:13,559
monishes uh individuals in 1930s

220
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,180
so it was very interesting so then

221
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,958
they're going to do stuff private

222
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:22,319
Brotherman uh had a successor and he in

223
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,899
his paper in 1952 suggested or indicated

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,300
that this professor will use these first

225
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,179
one initial cultivars and combine them

226
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:32,278
with this highly

227
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:35,159
high quality cultivars that Dr releman

228
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,958
developed so you can see how the hand

229
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,579
breathing has been going on and what you

230
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,919
are seeing right now may have been

231
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,040
originated from a long time ago but from

232
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:47,240
those researchers

233
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,599
um later in 1946

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,639
Walter Hoffman another German researcher

235
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,120
identified what he called bright stems

236
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,059
mutation which is a yellow stem that you

237
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,879
may see on that side

238
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:06,958
um so eventually

239
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,299
um the need of ease of the collaboration

240
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,639
um in the industry

241
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:14,639
elicited the Dutch researchers to

242
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,578
release four cultivars among which there

243
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:21,240
is this called chameleon in Ivory which

244
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:24,539
are well researched yellow stem cultures

245
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,579
and there are papers from 2018 very

246
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,458
recently and from this year that

247
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:31,199
suggests the ease of the corrugation the

248
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,699
higher bus content compared to a green

249
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,839
stem

250
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,759
so I think as you can see like what we

251
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,399
are doing is not new but rather

252
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:47,240
necessary and is where we are right now

253
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,240
and is a guy where we should go

254
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:53,519
um so bringing it back to us to us as a

255
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:57,239
summary uh

256
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,000
there was a first a first breeder in the

257
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,379
U.S using some recurrent penalty pixel

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,940
action

259
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,578
um there were some researchers in

260
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,160
Germany improving bus content others

261
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:10,859
finding personal issues others finding

262
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,958
price stamps so let's bring it

263
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,480
to current call in time

264
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,599
uh right now the vast content that we

265
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,019
see is about 25

266
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,079
35 bus content however this year I read

267
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:29,100
a paper claiming firmlythuania claiming

268
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,899
a culture having 42.23 bus which is

269
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,180
ridiculous

270
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,458
um so it's great right like hopefully

271
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:37,379
it's true I don't know but

272
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,639
that you know these cultures are all

273
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:40,559
over the place I just mentioned

274
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,600
Lithuania right so we need to assess

275
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,638
hero classes for different locations to

276
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,278
see what performs best thing if it

277
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,620
doesn't what traits can we take

278
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,299
advantage of so that it works here with

279
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,159
other General customers more adapted to

280
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,059
here right

281
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,439
um

282
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,359
so

283
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,459
yeah

284
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,019
um so for that reason you have young

285
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,419
Blossom here that is the issue there is

286
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,220
one issue that is yellow that is thin

287
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,039
stem the stick stamp

288
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,860
um and then we have dual purpose here so

289
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:14,099
does any of you know the current or the

290
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,419
average yield in the U.S or fiber or

291
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,579
grain

292
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,578
well I didn't know that either so yeah

293
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,679
every single day

294
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,839
um

295
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,278
yeah so in Canada it's about a thousand

296
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,540
kilograms per hectare so being a path to

297
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:43,078
the system you may understand is 750 190

298
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,759
pounds per acre in like average with dry

299
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,879
lands and irrigated they have two

300
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,879
different

301
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,139
um so for Fiverr uh in a fiber

302
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:56,760
production system alone instead of dual

303
00:13:52,139 --> 00:14:00,299
is 2.4 to 4.8 tones very good breaker

304
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,919
and for dual is 0.3 to 0.6 don't break

305
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,278
why am I telling you all this number

306
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,679
because you have handouts of our yield

307
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:11,399
our projected yield for these local

308
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,799
trials and what we can achieve if we

309
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,700
extend this on a small trial to a larger

310
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,039
scale

311
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,540
so I wanted you to have that those

312
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,578
numbers as a reference when you look

313
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,699
into those handouts

314
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,699
um

315
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:27,419
[Applause]

316
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,220
and lastly another thing I wanted to say

317
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,439
is well

318
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,300
hemp produces fiber right but there's

319
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
another problem which is fiber it's

320
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:38,819
widely grounded right a paper in 2020

321
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,078
assets the comparison between hand fiber

322
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,019
and cotton

323
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:47,519
and forever on average produces three

324
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,679
times more fiber per acre than over area

325
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,940
actually than cotton is more

326
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,338
environmentally friendly and

327
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,440
um it reduces costs in Agricultural

328
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,560
Product approach or cultural activities

329
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,760
rather of

330
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,179
77.7 percent

331
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,159
so the numbers are out there and the

332
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,419
potential is out there you need to take

333
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,578
advantage of it

334
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:15,000
and this is what we're doing right now

335
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:17,278
so here we have 12 fiber cultures uh you

336
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,259
can see the names I mean you also have

337
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,480
the handouts so you can freely walk

338
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,419
around and look at the plants if you

339
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,320
don't like this reps

340
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,639
um

341
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,959
we have

342
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,940
um

343
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,479
four reps in a randomized complete block

344
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,100
design each rep is a block with all the

345
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,100
YouTubers are randomized within the

346
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,879
block of those four blocks

347
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,800
um so I spoke a lot so let me just pause

348
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,799
a little any questions so far

349
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:52,039
great question

350
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,039
um

351
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,600
so it will vary because of germination

352
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:06,000
rate seed size so I don't like cookie

353
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,519
curved numbers because you may not have

354
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,679
specific Target plan density that you

355
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,139
need so

356
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,759
um so that the what I can tell you is

357
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,079
the idea of plant density of the target

358
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,838
plant density

359
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:23,519
uh or Dual Purpose that would be 12 tons

360
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,620
per square meter and for fiber per

361
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,679
square foot first workout sorry

362
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,500
um and for fiber it would be infinite

363
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,958
from like 30 plants per square

364
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,639
foot

365
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,599
45

366
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,240
so

367
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,879
I think you should go by the Target plan

368
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,639
density and then just based on

369
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,860
germination inside yep I'm curious what

370
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,959
you did for weed control and how these

371
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,060
plots were prepared if you did no more

372
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,979
flour just harrowing did you do any

373
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,559
cover crop testing any regenerative

374
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,759
farming

375
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,758
chemicals any manual cultivation was

376
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,459
it's done in all the we didn't spray

377
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,860
any other side at all I don't think we

378
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,759
had a cover crop here before I don't

379
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,198
remember

380
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,199
um

381
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,199
watering

382
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,740
did you water it rain fast

383
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:19,619
yeah it's not watering I think just the

384
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,660
very beginning we oh no no no irrigation

385
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:25,078
yeah and then there's regular

386
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,439
mechanization around the edges but

387
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,438
you know

388
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,879
so which is a very good point that you

389
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,418
bring up because based on the genetics

390
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,980
we have different Leaf sizes right so

391
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,538
that can create kind of because you're

392
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,700
very early in the system preventing any

393
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:44,519
Wheat growth so that's another trait

394
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,319
that we're interested in uh what I would

395
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,240
like to say it's like the ceiling bigger

396
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,519
like how bigger is a plant burial in the

397
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,380
system to reach that kind of enclosure

398
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,379
so then you don't have any competition

399
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:01,319
you have one color will unrelated

400
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,980
if you've been tracking or testing

401
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,740
content it's very interesting yeah so at

402
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,419
Harvest we collect we Harvest one square

403
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,058
meter and then that square meter

404
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:14,220
composes all the stems there and then we

405
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:17,700
have we will we will lay the red

406
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:22,200
material and after that we will milk

407
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:26,340
mail the material and analyze a cellular

408
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,740
hemicellulose and effective content last

409
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,359
question

410
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:35,058
do you call the hurt the shifts do you

411
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,058
call that fiber I don't refer to itself

412
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,359
fiber grain but the fiber is you know

413
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,779
there's more hurt than yeah it's uh what

414
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,779
is it like

415
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,460
but depends how you grow it so you're

416
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:56,279
harvesting Dual Purpose that would be

417
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,140
mostly heard yeah yes before you reach

418
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,660
flowering and you will get mostly fast

419
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,340
which will be that still I will be in

420
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,440
the same proportion but sorry the

421
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,659
proportion will be much less uh you'll

422
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,220
still have more hair yeah and to get

423
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,080
those really high levels of bass fiber

424
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,819
that you're talking about earlier that's

425
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,678
not going to be textile grade it might

426
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:16,220
be good for non-wovens but I think for

427
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,240
textile grade fibers

428
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,100
earlier right so it's not fully

429
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,419
signified and then you might only see

430
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,819
less than 10 percent

431
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,500
uh well

432
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:27,000
there's no market for textile grade

433
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,700
fibers but

434
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,798
okay uh I do think there's America in

435
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,100
North Carolina right yeah

436
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,099
foreign

437
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,720
to maximize the past and I think

438
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,160
as long as you get the long fiber which

439
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,620
are the primary bus they are long enough

440
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,960
for a spinning uh you know the longer

441
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:54,119
you play

442
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,819
mature it will be shorter so again for a

443
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:59,099
screening that would be very complicated

444
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,200
that's why we have to and also the plant

445
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,939
density is much higher here to maximize

446
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,120
that so we have the independent

447
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,240
competition right so that it triggers

448
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:12,418
more growth among plants uh you have

449
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,259
longer internal notes I have finer I

450
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:19,080
mean many papers from Europe claim that

451
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:20,660
the higher the plant density the finer

452
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,159
the fibers you get

453
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,120
the nutrition as well although that's a

454
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,798
little bit because you have to be

455
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,759
careful with nutrition

456
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,759
um but yeah

457
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:34,459
could you talk about your planting Davis

458
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:34,459
uh

459
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,380
you can have

460
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:42,480
well maybe not here but multiple co-ops

461
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,940
in one year just talking about great

462
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,599
question yes um so these are that into

463
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,340
the flower environment yeah

464
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,319
um so the question was if I could

465
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:56,119
elaborate more on the plant thanks for

466
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:59,279
the planting date and uh yeah

467
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,779
the whole the whole process of from

468
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,879
seeing

469
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,980
in the whole like time frame from the

470
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,919
sea from heating to harvest

471
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,019
um so when this trial

472
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,640
so in the handout you will see two

473
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,038
content planting dates

474
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,520
so this entire field was planted on May

475
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,319
18th uh there's a second planting all

476
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,940
the way down there when we walk towards

477
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,159
the end of this field you will see four

478
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,620
blocks that's the second planting that

479
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,820
was uh for the fiber plot that was on

480
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:31,918
June 9th and for a dual quad that was on

481
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,460
June 30th the reason why I didn't wear

482
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,460
space out is because

483
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,000
um

484
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,058
yeah so the flowering time you see

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,919
you see handouts you have different

486
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:48,000
flowering plants so I think I have

487
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:51,240
different Criterion for each fiber right

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,579
so for Fiverr I harvest it when the

489
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,220
plant reaches 50 flowering

490
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:00,359
in that way I maximize yield and I

491
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:03,360
minimize my loss in quality of fiber for

492
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,939
dual I harvest between six to seven

493
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,058
weeks after about 85 percent of the

494
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,298
plants have flour so in that way I

495
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:13,399
minimize seed shattering I maximize

496
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,720
maturity

497
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,700
and well that also depends on the blood

498
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,380
pressure you have now

499
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,659
the plant delay is a good question

500
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,320
because in the industries claim that

501
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,760
crop is X days and 100 dates and

502
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:30,918
something like that so if you look at

503
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,919
the handout I can tell you the opposite

504
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:44,400
however another thing that I want to

505
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:46,918
mention is that in Europe in 2008 there

506
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,900
was a paper uh talking about Growing

507
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,500
Degree Days having other crop is

508
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,200
commonly done this paper was later

509
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,940
evaluated again in 2012 validated but

510
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,919
after that no one has touched our paper

511
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,600
they came up with uh and some of those

512
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,720
cultivars that they use for that model

513
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,199
are growing right now so what I'm doing

514
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,339
like these two planting dates is to see

515
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,240
environmental effects on these School

516
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:17,879
divorce planted very early in late

517
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,220
and to see how they've looked right now

518
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,380
um another thing that flowering time

519
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,480
should tell you is the

520
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:30,000
uh how homogeneous uh the graphics so

521
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,759
if you look at the handout some plants

522
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,380
will reach this flower sorry we will

523
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,619
start flowering from one percent to 50

524
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,260
or one percent to 100 at different rates

525
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:43,139
depending on when they are planted

526
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:46,558
uh so that may also be explained by The

527
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,179
Growing Degree Days uh in this model so

528
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,940
I want to explore that I want to look at

529
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,880
into that and which cultivas abide by

530
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,220
that and instead of using x amount of

531
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,620
days it was based on you know I don't

532
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,480
know what they're basing on but uh

533
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:03,000
indicator is a Formula would be better

534
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,240
indicator flower so you can schedule

535
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,579
your equipment uh in all the processing

536
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,339
and so forth and so on

537
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,079
um however I am very certain that not

538
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:17,879
all cultivas will abide by that model

539
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:21,298
because of heavy genetic um effects x59

540
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,760
is one of those will flower about 20 30

541
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:27,259
days however in the handout you'll see

542
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,259
that it's not good covered

543
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,359
um so I work really hard to put those

544
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,760
data together for you to take advantage

545
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,740
of those numbers and to see the

546
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,839
distinction between this and to say hey

547
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,759
actually your website says 100 and

548
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,220
something but maybe this is not so much

549
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,640
in this in this area now everything

550
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,860
changes the uh lower the lower the light

551
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,120
of the you go to plan these Contours

552
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,279
okay

553
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,279
[Music]

554
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,620
no no

555
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,480
yeah

556
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,699
baby

557
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,919
Vari crowns are a lot of fun because

558
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,179
there's so much genetic diversity

559
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,919
and you probably know these books better

560
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,759
than anyone else so which is your

561
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,759
favorite variety one

562
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,960
um so maybe they're saying that I know

563
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,200
this vlogger than anybody and that's

564
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,200
right

565
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,940
and which one is my favorite cultivar or

566
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,819
variety and why

567
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,159
uh early hours

568
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,319
but

569
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,200
actually question

570
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,839
um 23 11 43 is our brain line uh if you

571
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,759
look around uh one thing you will notice

572
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,699
is the lodging there is lodging going on

573
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,640
uh 23 1143 is the one that's standing

574
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,759
very strong uh another particular

575
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,299
um trait of this green line is a seat

576
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:54,599
size you may have seen the seats on the

577
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:56,759
sample size around one that I gave you

578
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,240
guys and you can see the seats are

579
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,240
massive

580
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:07,439
to soybean so I find that very appealing

581
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,940
and as an agronomist like that's a very

582
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,519
enticing ironic trait they want to

583
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,940
pursue

584
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,619
oh in the late flower and trade as well

585
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,320
so I think that that building line has a

586
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,719
potential uh for either a global purpose

587
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,798
or a grain or sorry a fire cookware

588
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,798
depending on any planted

589
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,538
for all these varieties

590
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,880
for this latitude or did you grow some

591
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:44,038
that or specific for other latitude just

592
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,778
to see how they're going to do uh I

593
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,400
think the latter yeah so the question

594
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:49,679
was

595
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,298
uh collaborations with other

596
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,519
universities

597
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:56,278
um yeah the question is if I decided to

598
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,158
use or to test the school device based

599
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,859
on their uh after related to this

600
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,020
surgeon or I was just testing like

601
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:08,278
overall all available neural classes so

602
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:11,278
yeah so I tested with that test cultivas

603
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:14,659
from different regions uh probably in

604
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:17,599
order than our thousand of our latitude

605
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:21,120
from where they're coming from Europe

606
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,399
however our green lines are being tested

607
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,879
across the United States so we have

608
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,679
trials

609
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,840
we have one in North Carolina that even

610
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,500
is helping us phenotype we have one in

611
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:38,278
Kentucky which is managed by Dr Wolf

612
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:42,960
peers we have one in Texas uh

613
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:43,980
Calvin Russell and one in homes tutorial

614
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,460
like my

615
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,319
advisor password

616
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,480
so we're seeing and you can see in the

617
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:55,158
handout actually that our green lines

618
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,159
have their performing you know

619
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:03,419
and the different

620
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,419
our yields and benefits that

621
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,819
or not affected by the Light

622
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,359
photo period

623
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,159
that will be the main factor whatever

624
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,158
the fact of like the rainfall

625
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,740
now it's related to your friend Ecuador

626
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:21,719
yeah and

627
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,159
I've been Decor many times I started the

628
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,120
process educating the government there

629
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,120
in 2013.

630
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:37,200
and then realized that well there's not

631
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,380
really any uh varieties that will do

632
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,620
well in life cycle for

633
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,840
stalking greatness nothing out but

634
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:47,939
that's what I was leading to is there

635
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,359
something have you tried have you

636
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,419
brought genetics there I brought today

637
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,759
or grown and seeing me then only get

638
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,480
this tall and go to flower you know

639
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,400
whereas here they get 20 people

640
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,000
oh the question is if

641
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:09,840
um we have tested or brought germ plasma

642
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,298
from latitude close to the equator uh

643
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,740
and uh I think I don't know if you can

644
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:16,740
see this but uh

645
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,740
okay

646
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:28,678
three

647
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:32,339
yeah I'm curious to put that the larger

648
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:36,000
seat size is attractive larger seat size

649
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:38,699
less seats per pound higher uh planting

650
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,278
weight per acre to get the same stand

651
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,259
production costs could go up

652
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,119
so I guess what's attractive from your

653
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:48,119
perspective about the larger

654
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,819
yeah so the question is uh why am I so

655
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:54,739
attracted to the seat size even though

656
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:58,798
I mean less seats per pound and a higher

657
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,839
cost for ceiling and establishment so I

658
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,538
knew whenever we asked a question

659
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,939
um and my counter argument to that is

660
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,798
the strong ceiling Vigor of this General

661
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,960
plasma that will ensure kind of

662
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,639
precaution much earlier than others and

663
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,159
because of that you may require less

664
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,360
seed to get the same stand count

665
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,980
compared to a small CA cultivar that you

666
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,240
require more seats to reach kind of

667
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,278
people closer that it will eventually

668
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,240
lead to self-cleaning so you'll be

669
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,980
losing uh money by the self-learning

670
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,339
individuals of those extra seats that

671
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,099
you're planting so that is my hypothesis

672
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:36,658
and I'd like to test that next year to

673
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,019
be more accurate not just based on

674
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:44,299
genotype but also the seat size original

675
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:44,298
type different size yep good question

676
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,480
it's also a great parent material when

677
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,940
you breed it with others so now you can

678
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,700
see a complete variation in seat size

679
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,259
and you can actually select an idea seed

680
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,960
side during a segregation without a lot

681
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,960
yeah do you have data on that oh there

682
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,759
you go

683
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,519
so the question is if there is variation

684
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,278
in seat size that actually I can take

685
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,679
advantage of and develop cultivars uh

686
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,480
for for example as multilaterals for

687
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,659
fiber production and last year equal to

688
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,380
us for Doppler production uh so you've

689
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:25,200
got ahead of myself so I have uh Mafi

690
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,919
population which we're comparing uh two

691
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,919
genotypes

692
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:34,859
irrigating and the the difference

693
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:37,500
between the currency is astounding is

694
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:40,319
like feed 50 grams thousand seed weight

695
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,519
compared to five gram thousand Seaway so

696
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,939
we spend all right

697
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,940
[Laughter]

698
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:57,480
so there could be some major effect

699
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:59,220
genes that can be used and we can select

700
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,700
for specific General Pleasant that are

701
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,940
small cities or large cities

702
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,580
as long as render was right so

703
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,919
the idea is so that that can help us

704
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:13,980
develop markers and then we can put it

705
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,799
into our toolkit to uh you know better

706
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,360
General plasma also

707
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,099
um

708
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,959
2011-43 I've been like still working on

709
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,418
it and there are happy with this

710
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,880
irrigation for seat size so the reason

711
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:29,340
why I was saying earlier that from 2014

712
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,640
I can develop fiber and the wall is

713
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:35,339
because I've seen this irrigation and I

714
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,799
could do phenotypic record selection to

715
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,119
determine oh these genotypes will be

716
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:39,898
better for dual and this will be for

717
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,319
fiber

718
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:45,058
yep but the bottom line is that f1n the

719
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:47,460
F2 generation of that cross between

720
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:48,898
large seated and very small seated is

721
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,759
right in the middle it's an additive

722
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:53,639
trait so Mendel was wrong

723
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,980
we would have expected right if it were

724
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,140
dominant either large or small but it's

725
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,720
clearly a quantitative additive trait

726
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,399
that's going to take a lot of time to

727
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,120
breed back

728
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:08,639
uh if we want to introgress those traits

729
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,019
and get large seed or a small seed it's

730
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,200
going to take a lot of breeding to do

731
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:12,200
that

732
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,440
crazy question

733
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,019
how how strong is the relationship

734
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,298
between large seeds and high grade

735
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,399
imagine you're playing this game where

736
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:29,519
you have

737
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,459
fewer larger seeds versus a greater

738
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,679
number of smaller seeds uh how does that

739
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,220
come out in the wash in terms of overall

740
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,538
feel free here or is there just not a

741
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,759
straw

742
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:43,798
and maybe as we're walking down maybe

743
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,940
people can sample particular varieties

744
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:46,940
and look at the same size

745
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:52,259
because you only have about okay yeah

746
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,740
um could you elaborating your questions

747
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:58,319
I feel confused yeah yeah no problem so

748
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,339
how strong is the relationship between

749
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:05,819
yield per acre of grain with seed size

750
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:09,239
because I imagine there's a game where

751
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:11,099
a fewer number of large seeds or a

752
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,618
greater number of smaller seeds perhaps

753
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:17,460
so is that a tight relationship is there

754
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:21,179
a have you observed yeah so in the in

755
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:24,119
the handout I put together a the yield

756
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,119
data maybe we should start walking

757
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,119
um

758
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,359
hi my name is Chris I am the plant

759
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,139
pathologist

760
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:42,239
generally people are not enthusiastic uh

761
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,700
about the plant Pathologists because you

762
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,519
know we deal with rotten plants

763
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:50,460
but we're here to tell you that we are

764
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:53,338
also working to deal with producing a

765
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,300
healthier stand more quickly so in my

766
00:34:53,338 --> 00:35:00,599
lab uh for hemp we have people working

767
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,760
on uh Patrick is working on root rot

768
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,280
issues which he'll talk about I have

769
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,160
another student working on septoria leaf

770
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,140
spot which is among the biggest leaf

771
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,539
spot issues here in the state of New

772
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:13,440
York given the humidity and rain that we

773
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,858
have

774
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,059
uh and then I have a student that's

775
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:24,179
working on Downey mildew again that's a

776
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:26,099
water mold that can be really

777
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:28,199
problematic especially if it gets

778
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:31,440
established early in the season and we

779
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,598
have a wet season and then finally uh

780
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,179
together with the breeding program we

781
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,420
have a large group of folks working on

782
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:42,659
powdery mildew which can be an issue in

783
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,838
the field but is absolutely an issue in

784
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:50,159
high tunnel and Greenhouse ground crops

785
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:53,099
and in fact we have identified a source

786
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:56,159
of resistance or technically lack of

787
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,680
susceptibility to powdery mildew that's

788
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,440
now in the breeding program and I am

789
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,379
hopeful as a plant pathologist that the

790
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,900
breeding program will breed all

791
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,099
cultivars to be resistant to powdery

792
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,099
mildew

793
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,660
laughs

794
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,800
I don't know how much influence I'll

795
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:16,618
have

796
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,599
um but today I would like to introduce

797
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,000
my PhD student

798
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,180
Patrick McMullen and he's going to talk

799
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,980
to you about a seed treatment study that

800
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:27,779
we're working on he'll start with

801
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,579
talking about the importance of it and

802
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,200
then move into some of the results and

803
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,200
where we're going with it in the future

804
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,338
thank you Chris

805
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,800
um so we've been talking a lot about

806
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:42,659
above ground traits of uh hemp this

807
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,000
morning

808
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,219
louder

809
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,739
um but you can't really have a healthy

810
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:52,319
plant without a healthy root system to

811
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:53,759
support that above ground growth so

812
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,280
we're interested in focusing on

813
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,780
promoting uh early establishment High

814
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,519
densities by promoting good root growth

815
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,800
there's a number of soil-borne pathogens

816
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,639
that can infect root systems and prevent

817
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,339
that good root establishment so these

818
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,960
are among water molds lithium and many

819
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:15,019
species of pythium can cause stamping

820
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,400
off where you have early seedling death

821
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:20,219
this pathogen will enter the root system

822
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,960
and essentially Decay the cortex of the

823
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,598
roots where the outer Roots will just

824
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,800
slop off and then die leading to Total

825
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,740
plant collapse

826
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,440
there's also fungal pathogens among

827
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:34,919
fusarium species and others that will

828
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,700
cause root diseases in older mature

829
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,619
plants that will the fungal hyphy can

830
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,419
grow into the root system clog the

831
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:43,980
vasculature and prevent water flow

832
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,659
through those upper shoots of the plant

833
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,780
which are going to cause your plants to

834
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:51,420
wilt and eventually die

835
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,940
so our goal here in this study was to

836
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,480
see if we can

837
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:00,059
promote the plant to root early

838
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,280
well early in its life cycle by applying

839
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:07,639
a fungicide seed treatment

840
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,640
so here um this is all in the handout

841
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,480
um so we'll be passing around some

842
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,180
images of root diseases that you can

843
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,280
look at what I was just discussing where

844
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:25,500
you can see the reddish brown

845
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,619
discoloration on the roots small root

846
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:33,079
growth and then necrosis and wilting and

847
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,079
plant collapse on the shoots of the land

848
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,820
standing in front of we used four

849
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,098
different fungicide sea treatments and a

850
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:45,000
non-trade control so there were two

851
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:48,059
Copper products americop and ultim

852
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,880
and a phosphite and phosphate product

853
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:53,519
proven 44 and neutral and then we also

854
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,900
included a conventional control of apron

855
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,820
and Maxim

856
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,260
um a combination of two different

857
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,280
fungicides

858
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:05,040
so these were applied to two different

859
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,200
cultivars we included 5 or 79 and Futura

860
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,119
83. all of the treatments are in both

861
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,179
cultivars and this is organized in a

862
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,000
randomized complete block design all of

863
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:17,578
the treatments can be found on the if

864
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,320
you scan the QR code here on the field

865
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,480
map if you scroll to the bottom it will

866
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,740
say you see treatments and you can look

867
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,740
at the up

868
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:27,419
and yes but there's the specific field

869
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,279
map so you could look at which

870
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,460
treatments are here

871
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,400
um so in in this study

872
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,539
I collected uh stand count data at

873
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,180
several time points throughout the

874
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:40,739
growing season and as you can see it's

875
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:44,338
not harvested yet so we don't have that

876
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:47,159
final data but if we're looking at these

877
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:49,619
numbers here we can see that both ultim

878
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,420
and prudent 44 are neutral significantly

879
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:54,720
increase the average number of seedlings

880
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,300
per plot so these were just a sample of

881
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,118
a one meter quadrat section from each

882
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,220
plot where we counted the average number

883
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,380
of seeds per treatment

884
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:08,299
all of the treatments did numerically

885
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,800
improve the stand count density so

886
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,000
americop and the apron and maximum

887
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
treatments here weren't significantly

888
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,539
greater than the non-true control but we

889
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,240
still did see a pretty large numeric

890
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:20,039
increase there and these continued at

891
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,799
the next time point that we measured as

892
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,960
well so there is uh some optimism here

893
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,859
that these seed treatments do improve

894
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,139
our

895
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:29,940
stand counts and plant establishment

896
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:32,519
here

897
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,880
um soon I I will be collecting Harvest

898
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,599
data so I'll be measuring biomass and

899
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,780
um

900
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,579
uh fiber quality and content to assess

901
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,560
how these seed treatments correlate to

902
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,500
yield so we want to answer the question

903
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,000
if we see an increase in Stand count as

904
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,699
we're seeing from these data on the

905
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,380
sheet that you have now does that

906
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,338
correlate to yield at the end of the

907
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,440
season

908
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:58,320
so are we still seeing that Improvement

909
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,480
in yield or can improving the stand

910
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,760
count allow us to reduce the seeding

911
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,980
density that we're using so using less

912
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,599
seed but maybe using a seed treatment to

913
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,920
help us out there

914
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,660
um so I think there's a lot of potential

915
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,820
here we're going to repeat this

916
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:13,259
experiment next year as well and we

917
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,300
would like to include a biologic

918
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,900
treatment so the treatments that we used

919
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,680
this year were just copper

920
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:24,358
phosphite and conventional fungicide

921
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:27,358
two of those americop and ultimar

922
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:30,179
organic products the other two are not

923
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,980
none of them are labeled on hemp yet but

924
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:33,719
there is some of that works in the

925
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,400
process for several of these products

926
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,219
but we would like to expand this work

927
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,800
further next year to include biological

928
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:42,779
products to we'll for sure

929
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,900
yeah we all have a bacillus and

930
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,060
liquidations product to test

931
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:52,280
um just to give Growers more options and

932
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,279
different strategies for control

933
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,019
um and I think I would like to take any

934
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,780
questions you might have about sea

935
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:02,338
treatments or diseases diseases in

936
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,880
general

937
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:05,880
yes effective

938
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,019
um so that's it

939
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,880
yeah so the question was how expensive

940
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,500
is the seed treatment or is it cost

941
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,720
effective

942
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,599
um we don't have those data yet because

943
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:20,699
we can't correlate it to heal

944
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,680
um I don't know if you have any idea and

945
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:26,279
how much it would cost

946
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:29,759
I don't no so it's such a small volume

947
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,119
that generally seed treatments tend to

948
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,339
be more cost effective than treatments

949
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,960
once plants are established and

950
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:39,358
especially if the cost of hemp seed is

951
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,639
so high that if we can reduce the number

952
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,460
of seeds needed by applying a seed

953
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:45,618
treatment that could be a great way to

954
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,960
um

955
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:50,579
we will have those data probably by the

956
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,519
end of next year after we have enough

957
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:55,940
enough reps yeah so more information on

958
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,940
that to come

959
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,920
okay

960
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:04,318
the currency costs

961
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,659
yeah the question is uh what is the

962
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:11,099
price of seed and we have a number of

963
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:13,019
seeds uh sales people here uh who can

964
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:15,119
answer that question to you directly so

965
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:15,900
Sarah Mitchell of Kings AG received is

966
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,099
here

967
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:24,200
Corby minute of canopy us is here

968
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:28,980
uh there's Corby and uh I I would say

969
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:31,980
our goal as a plant breeder and uh

970
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,619
uh you can we can talk to Trey Trey asks

971
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,380
a good question to Luis it's probably

972
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,539
three dollars a pound

973
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,160
and again then you have to think about

974
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,739
your seating rate

975
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:47,338
you're seating for brain production at

976
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:50,639
25 pounds per acre but for five or we're

977
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:52,980
seating some at a hundred pounds

978
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,719
uh so those are important economic

979
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,940
questions we need to work out with our

980
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:03,480
agronomists uh and uh let me just follow

981
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,400
up Patrick's talk by saying here that in

982
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,740
in many of these small plot trials and

983
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,480
we've done these uh with collaborators

984
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:11,879
academic collaborators across the

985
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,679
country uh you know Ernie's is a good

986
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:19,920
example uh we rarely see greater than 50

987
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:23,279
percent seed establishment

988
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,338
so we're seating you know at a live seat

989
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,519
rate based on germination tests and then

990
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:32,818
coming out and doing stand counts and we

991
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:36,358
rarely see more than 50 of those live

992
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:38,400
seeds turning into an established

993
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:40,619
a good portion of that is probably due

994
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,858
to soil-borne pathogens so the work that

995
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,740
Patrick's doing you know is critical to

996
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:50,400
increase that rate of stand

997
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:52,019
establishment because 50 of this seed

998
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,000
that you're growing doesn't turn into it

999
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:54,960
that your planting doesn't turn into a

1000
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,780
plant

1001
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,639
right so then you have to plant twice as

1002
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:03,079
many seeds to get the stand that you

1003
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:06,838
want and that's not economical either

1004
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:10,560
so you know I I would have said

1005
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:13,078
in the industry that uh again four years

1006
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,179
ago one of our biggest problems was

1007
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,160
getting high quality seed that high

1008
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,679
germination rate because it was all

1009
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:21,960
coming in from Europe

1010
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:24,838
uh you know and we were always the last

1011
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,960
thought right but now that we have folks

1012
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:30,659
like Corby uh bringing in hempit rise

1013
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,720
from France in a timely manner and

1014
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:36,000
storing it properly uh

1015
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:37,259
uh and now we have domestic seed

1016
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,679
production from companies like

1017
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:44,700
International hemp uh and Canadian good

1018
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:47,699
Canadian seed from uni seeds and Verve

1019
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:49,858
uh and New West genetics all

1020
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:52,379
domestically produced I think we now

1021
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:55,440
have overcome that barrier in terms of

1022
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,420
the quality of seed so that you when you

1023
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,280
buy a seed lot and expect it to be 90

1024
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,318
germination rate

1025
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,060
you can get that now

1026
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:06,239
whereas you couldn't get that four years

1027
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:08,880
ago so now we need to move on to these

1028
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,039
other problems like uh you know seed

1029
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,140
treatments and getting herbicides

1030
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,139
approved and that's our next topic

1031
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:24,900
uh and I'd like to introduce vipin Kumar

1032
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:27,000
who is our new field crop wheat

1033
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:31,019
scientist at Cornell

1034
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,719
uh to talk about how we finally have an

1035
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:37,139
herbicide product labeled and registered

1036
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:39,118
for hemp that we can use and

1037
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:41,400
unfortunately our

1038
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,559
uh wheat scientists here at agritech

1039
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,740
Lynn sosnowski could not join us she's

1040
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,559
at a conference in North Carolina but

1041
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:51,598
bippin is going to quickly present some

1042
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,400
encouraging results from Lynn's group

1043
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,619
right

1044
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,180
thank you Larry good morning everyone

1045
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,280
morning

1046
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:03,299
what are you guys doing so far great

1047
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,220
great good good well uh as Larry

1048
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,200
mentioned I'm uh I'm a new to Cornell

1049
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm a new wheat scientist with a field

1050
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,159
crops

1051
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,500
um I have a counterpart here Dr Lynn

1052
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:17,279
susnowski who has been actively leading

1053
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,179
a sum of uh weed Management program in

1054
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,140
ham

1055
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:23,940
a little bit about my background uh

1056
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:27,598
before joining Cornell I was with Kansas

1057
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,940
State for more than five years and I was

1058
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,039
working in Western cases in hotel

1059
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,920
Dryland agriculture

1060
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:38,699
mainly working with the crops like

1061
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,880
sorghum wheat Dryland corn a little bit

1062
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:43,259
soybean as well as the sunflower a lot

1063
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,660
of fallow ground

1064
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,060
as you know in High Plains the moisture

1065
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,759
is limited and fallow based cropping

1066
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:53,299
system is predominant

1067
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,619
as you know no-till dry land

1068
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,019
you're not you're not able to do a

1069
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:59,400
tillage so you're relying on herbicides

1070
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:02,940
for me control

1071
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,980
and repeated use of herbicides over the

1072
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:08,159
decades has created a problem like

1073
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:11,159
herbicide resistant weeds so my role was

1074
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:15,299
there to come up with the strategies to

1075
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:17,879
to tackle those herbicides

1076
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,099
so jumping in a corner uh I'm gonna go

1077
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,680
and do kind of see

1078
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:25,380
uh in terms of developing a beat

1079
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:27,838
management programs in field crops so

1080
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,300
part of my responsibilities here is to

1081
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,119
come up with a sustainable weed control

1082
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,900
strategies in field crops including corn

1083
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:40,318
soybean Alfalfa as well as small grains

1084
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:45,240
so as I said I'm a six month old in

1085
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:48,838
Cornell and not aware about this new

1086
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:51,419
crop hemp but Lynn kind of gave me a

1087
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,299
quite an overview of what's going on in

1088
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:57,960
terms of weed control and you guys might

1089
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,400
have a handout here uh what has been

1090
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,920
going on in terms of weed control

1091
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,539
research in kernel agritech here in

1092
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,519
Geneva

1093
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:10,920
just a few uh very you know foundational

1094
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:13,739
points I like to Hammer as I do with

1095
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,500
other crops is uh

1096
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:19,439
as you know hemp compared to other crops

1097
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:22,858
is a relatively new crop uh so we don't

1098
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,960
have many options when I say options I

1099
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:27,299
talk about herbicide options we don't

1100
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,358
have many herbicide options to go with

1101
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:34,019
for weed control

1102
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:37,940
uh but fortunately uh work from Dr Lynn

1103
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:40,858
cisnos em other colleagues from USDA

1104
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,679
we were able to have a supplemental

1105
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:45,480
label with one of the herbicide in the

1106
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,399
New York this year

1107
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,099
and that herbicide is the sauna land

1108
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,019
from Govan company

1109
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:55,818
if you know or most of you know probably

1110
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:59,400
a group three or root growth Inhibitors

1111
00:49:55,818 --> 00:50:02,460
this herbicide belongs to group three uh

1112
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,980
you know herbicide side of actions so

1113
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,639
ital Floral in is the active

1114
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:13,559
and it is a label for both type of hemp

1115
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:15,539
and the rate is 1.5 to 3 points per acre

1116
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,539
and you can you know select the rate

1117
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:22,019
based on your soil type

1118
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:25,679
as well as you know other conditions

1119
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:28,980
so uh one important thing about the

1120
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:32,098
sonaline is is a pre and uh you know

1121
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,318
pre-planned applied herbicide so you

1122
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:38,099
probably have to incorporate this this

1123
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:40,199
herpeside when you're applying that

1124
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,780
and that can be done with the

1125
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,939
irrigations or rainfall or you if

1126
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,400
there's no rainfall or no irrigation

1127
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:50,700
available you probably have to do that

1128
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,858
incorporation mechanic mechanically so

1129
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:56,098
incorporation is a very very important

1130
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:59,358
and this group is basically a root

1131
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:02,519
growth Inhibitors as I said uh Target

1132
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,980
maturity of the grass species uh give

1133
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:08,460
grass species including Barnyard or

1134
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:12,000
crabgrass but also has activity on Broad

1135
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:14,818
leaves like big weeds so that's a good

1136
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,659
news in the hemp industry that we have a

1137
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:20,000
herpeside which you can you know use for

1138
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,920
for weed control

1139
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,358
and uh in general the feed control why

1140
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,358
weed control is important in hair

1141
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,159
like other crops if you allow weeds to

1142
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,559
grow especially in the early season like

1143
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,440
within one to four weeks after planting

1144
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,480
or transplanting uh you're gonna see the

1145
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,079
impact on the yield as well as the

1146
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,740
quality in the ham so early season

1147
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,240
competition is really really critical

1148
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:51,598
and I've been hearing from Larry and

1149
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:54,598
others uh you know very good work in

1150
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,960
terms of reading lines developing traits

1151
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,880
for good economic trades I would also

1152
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,639
probably see collaborations and work

1153
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,800
with Larry and others in the Futures to

1154
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,799
see if we have some potential and

1155
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,380
opportunities to select some lines that

1156
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:13,140
has a competitive Advantage compared to

1157
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,838
the weeds because we need those lines we

1158
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:19,039
need those uh you know cultivars having

1159
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:22,558
a comparative advantage than weeds

1160
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:24,779
so other than that you know that that

1161
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,480
handout also covers a lot of cultural

1162
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,480
practices you know very you know

1163
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,000
understandable things which we can do to

1164
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,119
to avoid weeds basically preventive

1165
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,920
measures you know don't grow hemp in in

1166
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,380
the fields where you know there is a lot

1167
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,920
of seed bank wheat seed bank basically

1168
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,858
selective

1169
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:49,440
uh you know proper timing planting time

1170
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:51,440
I see there's been three timings for

1171
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,300
some of these varieties has been planted

1172
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,240
uh I think that is a good approach to

1173
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,760
optimize that proper timing because some

1174
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:02,159
of these competitive weeds are also

1175
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,619
coming at that time at that time and if

1176
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,259
you have a proper timing you can Avail

1177
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:10,318
the opportunity to control those weeds

1178
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,940
before you plant your craft uh let those

1179
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,039
those weeds come and then you control

1180
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,659
this some some sort of burn down or some

1181
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,779
other methods of weed control and then

1182
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:21,118
plant so site selections planting time

1183
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,640
seeding rate a lot of interest in

1184
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,880
seeding rates and why large seed and

1185
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:29,400
versus small seed I guess Larry made a

1186
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,740
good point having a good bigger uniform

1187
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,559
germination uniform emergence is really

1188
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:36,539
critical when we are dealing with early

1189
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,720
season wheat competition so that you

1190
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:42,239
have a good canopy of the crop that can

1191
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:46,799
express the wheat early in the season

1192
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:49,318
so again you know cultural practices uh

1193
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,559
control weeds in rotational crops the

1194
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:55,440
one of the major hurdle in in terms of

1195
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,079
hemp we don't know much about the crop

1196
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,300
tolerance or crop plant back

1197
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,519
restrictions from most of the chemicals

1198
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,180
we use in our rotational crops things

1199
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:09,539
like in corn and soybeans so that is a

1200
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:12,000
big big hurdle to really bring more

1201
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:14,759
herbicide oxygen into the crop or use

1202
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,920
herbicide in rotational crafts so I

1203
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,280
would say select integrated approach

1204
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,680
integrator weed management approach rely

1205
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,900
on other options like a cultural

1206
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,719
practices as well as mechanical

1207
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:31,079
practices you can rely on some sort of

1208
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:33,598
Intel cultivation into remoing if you

1209
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,339
have planted those hemp in a standard

1210
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,800
rows

1211
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:40,500
along with you know herbicide maybe

1212
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,660
rotational crabs once in a while uh if

1213
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,760
you can so those are kind of the major

1214
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:48,358
uh points

1215
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,940
um I I had any any question you guys

1216
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,460
have for me yes is there going to be

1217
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,179
different uh herbicides you can use

1218
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:59,818
based on different Market classes so say

1219
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:02,039
you could use one for fiber grain

1220
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:04,318
production but not one for cannabinoid

1221
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,880
production yeah that's a good question

1222
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,400
and I wish

1223
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,380
uh the question is if they're going to

1224
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,660
be a herbicide options available for

1225
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,440
different classes for example for fiber

1226
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:18,539
or for green or for other types uh I

1227
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,400
guess I wish and everybody wish that

1228
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:23,338
that is the case but in case of

1229
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,559
herbicides uh labeling and registrations

1230
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:27,619
there's not a lot a lot a lot of

1231
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:30,720
interest from the industry standpoint

1232
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:33,539
because of the smaller industry the hemp

1233
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:38,399
industry I'm saying as well as the crop

1234
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:40,679
tolerance and and the crop plant back

1235
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,960
restrictions of course there has been

1236
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:45,299
some work with ir4 has been going on

1237
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,420
looking at other options other tools

1238
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:51,660
herbicide tools and Lynn mentioned that

1239
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,119
there's a quite a good uh results with

1240
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:57,598
the kizal of class one herbicides for

1241
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:59,640
grass control but again uh you know

1242
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,900
where that stands in terms of

1243
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,400
registrations uh still in the future

1244
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:08,099
similarly she has been looking to to

1245
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:11,700
look at some of the group 15s as metola

1246
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:14,039
Chlor acetophlore type materials in

1247
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:16,980
conjunction with sonal and so that you

1248
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,318
can extend the residual activity for

1249
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,838
season long weed control but again those

1250
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:23,579
are non-label herbicides in the hemp and

1251
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,699
I guess there's a more work needs to be

1252
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,700
done

1253
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:29,299
any other question yes

1254
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:39,119
question is if I'm doing any work with

1255
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:41,239
the inter planting uh I'm not as I said

1256
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm just developing my program

1257
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:48,479
and my major role is in field crops and

1258
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,699
when I was thinking of hemp especially

1259
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,858
for green type I think that falls

1260
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:55,980
probably under field crops

1261
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:59,279
and yeah I have not done any work maybe

1262
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:02,099
Larry has any any information on that

1263
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,780
yeah so that's a great question uh I was

1264
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:06,838
just talking with Sarah Mitchell and

1265
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,880
she's working on a system in

1266
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,639
Pennsylvania of planting a nurse crop

1267
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,700
with hemp and then I think you also want

1268
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:17,639
to talk to Professor Ginny Moore uh in

1269
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,679
plant breeding at Cornell who is uh

1270
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:21,838
breeding cover crops and I think has

1271
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:25,739
been looking at planting hemp into cover

1272
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:29,480
crops as well so that's a great question

1273
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:33,358
uh just to touch on your question

1274
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:35,460
the uh if you are growing for CBD or

1275
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,219
high THC cannabis

1276
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,858
uh that tissue will be tested and those

1277
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:43,558
tests often include a test for pesticide

1278
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:45,239
residue so there may well be a different

1279
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,940
herbicide regime that you're going to

1280
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:51,058
use for CBD hemp or cannabis versus

1281
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:53,400
grain and fiber based on that tissue

1282
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:58,440
residue testing

1283
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:01,440
yeah uh have you done any soil testing

1284
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,300
before the crop was planted and after to

1285
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,599
see was it like you know some chemicals

1286
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:08,280
were detrimental to the soil and that

1287
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,059
type of stuff yeah that's a great

1288
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:14,099
question the question is uh about doing

1289
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:17,880
pre-planting soil testing

1290
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:20,099
in particular to look for any uh

1291
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,619
elements in the soil or pesticide

1292
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,318
residues perhaps that might get into

1293
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:27,660
your crop that I would highly recommend

1294
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,940
that doing that for CBD hemp again

1295
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:32,818
because of the post-harvest testing

1296
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:35,000
regimes

1297
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:37,380
although we do not have a good

1298
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,798
understanding for example at the levels

1299
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,079
of cadmium in the soil that may lead to

1300
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:46,019
high levels of cadmium in the pleural

1301
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,619
tissue so it's a great question about

1302
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:51,960
doing those tests but

1303
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:56,460
uh by my understanding we we don't have

1304
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,579
good predictive ability to say how the

1305
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,818
results of those tests will end up in

1306
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,599
uh residues in your harvested crop for

1307
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:05,639
example

1308
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:09,240
what we do know is that hemp can be very

1309
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:11,039
tolerant of heavy metals yeah that's

1310
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,379
that's that's the thing because it it

1311
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,420
can suck up heavy metals out of the soil

1312
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,980
what happens to the biomass if we want

1313
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,500
to use it for construction for example

1314
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:21,358
yeah are we storing those heavy metals

1315
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,940
inside the walls of your house yeah so

1316
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:26,880
the question again is if if you test if

1317
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,619
you test and observe high levels of

1318
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,019
cadmium in the soil

1319
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:33,140
will that cadmium end up in the stems

1320
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:36,539
and then end up in your hemp creek

1321
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:38,759
uh and I'm focusing on cadmium because

1322
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:42,719
that is uh probably the main element

1323
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:45,000
that uh hemp is good at taking up heavy

1324
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,039
metal there are a lot of heavy metals uh

1325
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,619
and hemp is not going to take up all of

1326
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,440
those heavy metals but cadmium is one in

1327
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:55,380
particular

1328
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:58,019
uh so we we made a little demonstration

1329
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:01,440
of samal in here we planted this little

1330
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:04,798
trial on August 3rd and between the

1331
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,240
there are two replica strips uh the blue

1332
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,599
was

1333
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:12,298
not treated with sonolin the yellow

1334
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,859
strips were treated with two pints per

1335
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:17,159
acre of salmon

1336
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:20,519
uh Lynn surveyed those plots I think

1337
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:22,440
three weeks after planting and there was

1338
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:23,639
no significant difference in the wheat

1339
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,220
competition

1340
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:28,199
and that's mainly because the main weed

1341
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:32,039
that we had coming up was field Penny

1342
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:34,618
crust and Solomon specifically says on

1343
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,980
the label that it does not control Neil

1344
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:40,858
Penny crust

1345
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:43,740
so uh that again highlights that we need

1346
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:46,259
a range of methods as vipin said an

1347
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:50,098
integrated weed management approach

1348
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:52,559
and it all starts with keeping weeds out

1349
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:54,980
of your fields for the start so thanks

1350
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,980
very much

1351
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:02,279
you mentioned diseases and weeds and

1352
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,139
everything have you guys have any uh

1353
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,400
have experienced any problem with

1354
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:06,960
insects

1355
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,780
uh

1356
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,179
okay so the question is do we have any

1357
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,380
insect pests and again we have been

1358
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:16,019
working with

1359
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:19,260
uh started working with Elson Shields

1360
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:21,659
who was our field crops entomologist and

1361
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:24,839
uh more recently have been working with

1362
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:27,000
Marion zooflu zuffly and integrated Pest

1363
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:30,420
Management who have been doing insect

1364
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,719
surveys uh for a few years now and to be

1365
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:35,760
honest we do not have any uh insect

1366
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:38,338
pests that are causing economic damage

1367
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,660
in New York after several years of

1368
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:42,838
surveys

1369
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:45,058
have you seen aphids oh we yeah we see

1370
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:47,818
aphid we see cannabis safe in the field

1371
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:49,740
but it doesn't really uh uh our our

1372
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:53,298
conclusion at this point is that it is

1373
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:53,298
not causing economic damage

1374
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,960
all of these fields have been tilt yeah

1375
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:03,558
we have not done much work on no-till

1376
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,559
Sarah

1377
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,760
grain market

1378
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,760
because not everybody wants to grow a 50

1379
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:16,318
this is that a shorter

1380
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:17,818
green variety

1381
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,079
more

1382
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:21,659
I guess

1383
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,579
appropriate for farmers who aren't yet

1384
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:25,318
willing to spend tens of thousands on

1385
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:27,240
new equipment and that I guess the

1386
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:30,239
reason for that question is about

1387
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:32,338
insects in the grain so

1388
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,519
have you how much emphasis are you

1389
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:39,000
looking at for grain and and

1390
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:42,298
all Associated diseases and insects okay

1391
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,179
so Sarah is asking about our emphasis in

1392
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:46,920
terms of Market class of hemp uh so

1393
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:49,379
again I would classify that we have

1394
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:53,039
varieties that are best suited as a

1395
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:54,660
grain only dedicated grain crop that are

1396
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,358
easy to harvest with conventional

1397
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:59,818
combines

1398
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:03,179
uh we're today promoting I'll say we're

1399
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:05,039
promoting Dual Purpose crops uh partly

1400
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:09,000
because we want to demonstrate that

1401
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:11,039
Double Cup combine grain and fiber and

1402
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,400
also because I think the market growth

1403
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:17,099
potential right now is in the herd and

1404
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,160
fast areas

1405
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:23,220
as we all know man silver Harvest

1406
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,139
there's a lot of grain in in Canada

1407
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:27,858
and they can Harvest that with those

1408
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:31,858
whatever 60 foot wide combines out there

1409
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:34,318
uh whatever they are uh

1410
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:36,480
I'm going to defer your question till

1411
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:37,858
the afternoon when we're talking about

1412
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,219
the double cut

1413
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:44,039
uh because we are going to see some

1414
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:45,779
strip trials out there that did not

1415
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,139
reach the height that we need for the

1416
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,140
Double Cup

1417
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:53,699
so I definitely think there is a need

1418
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,920
and a market for dedicated grain only

1419
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:57,899
varieties once we get grain approved as

1420
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,000
an animal feed that's going to open up

1421
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,700
that market

1422
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,280
and we want Farmers to put those crops

1423
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:07,078
in rotation with their other small

1424
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,880
cereal grains that they can Harvest with

1425
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:13,640
their combine

1426
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,640
okay we need to move on uh

1427
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:21,358
um as Larry said we've been uh

1428
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,760
certified organic now it's I think we

1429
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:26,159
started transition in 1992 I was I was

1430
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,260
three I don't really remember that so my

1431
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,598
whole life we've been organic uh my

1432
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:33,839
viewpoint is not what can we get in a

1433
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:35,940
jug to get what can we get registered so

1434
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:38,699
we can handle the weeds it's how do we

1435
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,720
manage the weeds mechanically that's my

1436
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:42,000
whole

1437
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:44,399
view on this

1438
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,119
um we're farming about 1900 Acres of

1439
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:52,619
organic ground we process seed so and we

1440
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:55,798
do a lot of unusual things so when uh

1441
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:57,480
hemp licensing started in 2018 we jumped

1442
01:04:55,798 --> 01:04:59,699
right on and tried to grow hemp and it

1443
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,460
was a horrible disaster I guess we were

1444
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:04,078
focused on on grain production and we

1445
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,539
were running with a relatively low

1446
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,380
population

1447
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:11,279
and

1448
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:13,140
then we had some crusting issues and uh

1449
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,339
we didn't have an adequate population to

1450
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:16,318
manage the weeds and we didn't Harvest

1451
01:05:14,338 --> 01:05:18,358
anything two years in a row and we gave

1452
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,519
up the license because it just wasn't

1453
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:22,199
really working

1454
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:23,880
um and Larry tried to pull me back into

1455
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:26,399
hemp production a couple of times since

1456
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:29,579
then and I was not real interested until

1457
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,460
this year when I ran into this machine

1458
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:33,420
when I was in Germany visiting my wife's

1459
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,400
family

1460
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,380
um

1461
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,200
it was a curiosity so I went to visit

1462
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:42,480
the company and they told me that they

1463
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:47,039
have four machines running in

1464
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:49,880
Saskatchewan on hemp on an 8.6 by 8.6

1465
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:52,440
spacing dropping two seeds at each point

1466
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,940
uh they've dramatically reduced their

1467
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,440
seeding rate and they've increased

1468
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,000
yields and they have some side by side

1469
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,200
pictures then they realized they

1470
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
shouldn't have told me so much and

1471
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:02,578
wouldn't tell me who was doing this

1472
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,318
all right

1473
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:06,059
but in trying this we brought it in to

1474
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:07,558
grow red beets

1475
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:09,000
and we're going to grow azuki beans but

1476
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:12,119
we decided to try some hemp as well

1477
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,358
working with a licensed grower

1478
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:19,140
we were focused on seed production so we

1479
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:21,179
went with a 15 inch row spacing with a

1480
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:23,818
nine inch in row spacing

1481
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:26,159
we were dropping two to three seeds at

1482
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:27,980
each seeding point so that the seeds

1483
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,338
were able to help each other out

1484
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:31,679
[Music]

1485
01:06:29,338 --> 01:06:34,259
it's not a uniform spacing but it'll

1486
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,399
drop seating was a common practice 100

1487
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,140
years ago

1488
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,059
before some of our modern technology

1489
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:40,618
came along

1490
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:44,220
so

1491
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:46,619
we had by my calculations about 120 000

1492
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:49,679
seeds per acre maybe 140 000 seeds per

1493
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:51,838
acre and where the machine did what it

1494
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,598
was supposed to we have a perfectly

1495
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,699
clean field I say where it did what it

1496
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,859
it was supposed to because there's a

1497
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:01,439
huge learning curve with this technology

1498
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:05,338
this is an autonomous robot

1499
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:08,280
it did all of the planting it recorded

1500
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:10,099
the GPS location of every seed to the

1501
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,260
nearest half centimeter

1502
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:15,119
that's why as two GPS receivers on top

1503
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,180
we had to install our own base station

1504
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,440
one of our landlords actually has worked

1505
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:22,379
for the Navy and he said how are you

1506
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,000
getting it that accurate right yes

1507
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,099
I don't know he was aware that that

1508
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,480
accuracy was possible but didn't realize

1509
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:29,480
that it was open civilians

1510
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:35,400
so the the principle of the machine is

1511
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:39,119
to drop every seat know precisely where

1512
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:42,059
it is and then come back in later even

1513
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:46,500
pre-emergence and cultivate between

1514
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:48,240
those seeds with a a knife on an arm

1515
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,940
that is able to travel back and forth

1516
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:53,759
between the seating points you can do

1517
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:56,280
that on as little as 100 millimeters so

1518
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,559
four inches of space between seeds

1519
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:01,440
so I think there is space to

1520
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:04,798
increase seating rate decrease the space

1521
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,940
between seeds with this technology

1522
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,699
um

1523
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:11,519
I sent Larry a few pictures I think they

1524
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:14,639
went up of nearly clean under canopy

1525
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:18,179
views also some videos of it working

1526
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:20,579
between plants and because I don't know

1527
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:23,399
what you're all interests might be I'm

1528
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:24,979
going to open it up for questions

1529
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:28,079
boss

1530
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:31,259
uh right around 100 000 U.S

1531
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:32,880
there is not currently an importer in

1532
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:34,738
the United States this came in through

1533
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,659
Canada uh they've been putting a lot of

1534
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:37,698
pressure on me to be an importer don't

1535
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:41,579
have time

1536
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:43,259
uh so service is all coming out of

1537
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:45,359
Canada but I think we're going to see

1538
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:48,979
that changing probably within the next

1539
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:52,259
12 months economics return on investment

1540
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:54,838
uh at this point I believe this is very

1541
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:57,779
much a proven concept thing so we're not

1542
01:08:54,838 --> 01:09:00,838
as focused on that I think that the

1543
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:03,600
return on investment has to do with high

1544
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:06,119
value props so if this can be used on a

1545
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,219
farm that is growing vegetables that is

1546
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:10,559
growing

1547
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:13,500
also hemp maybe some other fiber crops

1548
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,239
like flax where your seeding period is

1549
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,619
stretched throughout the season and your

1550
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:18,238
cultivation period is stretched

1551
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:20,039
throughout the season the return is

1552
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,979
going to be a lot better it can

1553
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:25,738
theoretically handle 15 acres per day it

1554
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:27,238
does run 24 hours a day

1555
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:30,000
so

1556
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:31,379
just spreading out the period when it

1557
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,939
needs to be used is going to really

1558
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,159
increase the Acres that you can cover in

1559
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:37,318
a year a year and decrease the cost per

1560
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:39,179
acre the the operating cost per acre is

1561
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:41,400
practically zero yeah it's really just

1562
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:44,159
the wearing elements because all of the

1563
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:46,559
energy comes from the solar panels

1564
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:49,139
thank you

1565
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,359
24 hours but solar panels so what kind

1566
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,739
of storage of the energy that you have

1567
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,880
to run if you're going to let it plant

1568
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:56,939
after

1569
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,699
it has a set of Lithium-ion batteries on

1570
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:02,698
board the solar panels produce up to

1571
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:04,319
1600 watts of power and the maximum

1572
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,639
power requirement of the machine is

1573
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,099
1100.

1574
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,719
so it will charge through the day there

1575
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,380
is a second set of batteries that can be

1576
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:15,960
put on if needed

1577
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,819
some of the users in Europe that I talk

1578
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,279
to are actually mounting like a little

1579
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:21,719
600 watt inverter type generator on it

1580
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:23,158
and going out turning it on at 10

1581
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:26,039
o'clock at night to charge the battery

1582
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:28,079
while it continues working and shut it

1583
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,479
off when the sun comes up in the morning

1584
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,939
it's self-propelled it is self-propelled

1585
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:35,759
the tractor is not needed for no it is

1586
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:37,738
fully autonomous once you map the points

1587
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,020
in the field and any obstacles it

1588
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:41,939
develops a plan of where it's going to

1589
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,400
drive and then executes the plan that's

1590
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:46,619
the deal is stones in the soil it

1591
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:49,019
doesn't particularly like stones soil

1592
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:51,840
preparation is extremely important it's

1593
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,940
Stony here it is Stony here I would say

1594
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,500
that we are stonier down 10 miles south

1595
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:58,079
of here in Penn Yan the glaciers had a

1596
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,579
lot of fun on our farm

1597
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:00,779
um I've been picking Stone since I was

1598
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:04,140
big enough to pick them up and I think

1599
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:06,319
my grandma I think they grow I think

1600
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:09,900
that the soil is ending up in the lake

1601
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:12,420
all right so soil preparation is a huge

1602
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:15,359
deal this is very much focused any

1603
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,340
Horticultural model where you are paying

1604
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,679
much more attention to the soil than in

1605
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,719
Broad acre production

1606
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,779
but that's a great Point Jack that yeah

1607
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:27,719
mechanical cultivation uh is very very

1608
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:29,219
challenging on Stony soil we have a lot

1609
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:31,679
of those in here

1610
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:33,779
One of a Kind competition anything else

1611
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,179
like this there are some other companies

1612
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:39,119
in Europe there's a I think a lot more

1613
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:42,060
of a grant funding program in the EU for

1614
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:44,158
autonomy because labor costs are higher

1615
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:47,039
there's another company from Denmark

1616
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:50,099
called roboti uh Kong skilled was

1617
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:52,439
working in this for a while uh but I

1618
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,780
believe when they were bought by case

1619
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:56,879
New Holland that kind of went in a

1620
01:11:54,779 --> 01:12:01,380
different direction

1621
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:04,199
um there is a company called nio in

1622
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:08,340
France that is working on this and there

1623
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:11,339
is a raven in Canada is working on a

1624
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:13,739
much larger scale version of this

1625
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:16,619
what's happening it's impressive okay

1626
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:18,718
Kudos you mentioned this deep learning

1627
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:21,000
curve what sort of obstacles did you

1628
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,980
have to go through uh we prepared the

1629
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,420
ground like we would for our normal uh

1630
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:27,299
cultivation equipment and planting

1631
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,679
equipment and it wasn't happy uh it

1632
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,900
didn't like the amount of residue that

1633
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:32,219
was on top it didn't like how loose the

1634
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:34,319
soil was

1635
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,640
and it

1636
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,460
uh

1637
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,380
the first crop that we planted with it I

1638
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,939
had I think 300 text messages that

1639
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,340
something went wrong in the course of a

1640
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:46,439
day and a half

1641
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:50,119
how does that cover the seed

1642
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:53,879
it goes this way it's currently set up

1643
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:56,099
mostly in weeding configuration this row

1644
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,960
unit is set up for planting

1645
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,100
there is one item missing because I

1646
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,380
forgot to bring it up from the farm

1647
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,900
which is a closing shoe that goes on the

1648
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:06,119
back behind the primary press wheel

1649
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:09,719
before the secondary press

1650
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:13,640
but moves in this direction correct yeah

1651
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,640
it's impressive other questions

1652
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:19,439
yeah what about inroad cultivation yes

1653
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:22,759
it uh

1654
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:25,859
there is a Servo motor

1655
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,360
and he

1656
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:29,579
it's on now so it's not being

1657
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:32,759
cooperative it doesn't like to move but

1658
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:35,760
that Servo motor moves an arm in and out

1659
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:37,980
that arm carries a knife and is able to

1660
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,239
cultivate between seating points that it

1661
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:43,619
has mapped during the seating process

1662
01:13:41,238 --> 01:13:46,459
hopefully the video is up on our website

1663
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,460
you can see it

1664
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:50,839
that'll be one of the most popular ones

1665
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,800
okay thanks very much Peter

1666
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,430
[Music]

1667
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:27,178
exception Mark we really appreciate

1668
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:29,159
Cornell and Dr smart working with us and

1669
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:31,279
giving us the opportunity to build this

1670
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:34,319
machine this is the first mobile

1671
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:36,658
decorticator that's been built and and

1672
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:38,960
functional in the U.S we built the

1673
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:42,359
smaller one that was in Russia in 2018

1674
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,640
that's still running but it's a hand-fed

1675
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:48,539
single stock machine but we've been

1676
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,800
making Machinery since 2016 2017. uh

1677
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:51,658
believe it or not we started on

1678
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,940
decortication back then when it was not

1679
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:55,979
a thing that nobody was interested in it

1680
01:14:53,939 --> 01:14:59,460
and at the time we thought we would make

1681
01:14:55,979 --> 01:15:01,559
the corticators which the coordinator is

1682
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,420
just the second piece he's kind of been

1683
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,400
pieces right here this is the

1684
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,980
decorticator it's a roller breaker style

1685
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:11,279
machine Believe It or Not based on the

1686
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:13,198
1905 slickton model the got imp band in

1687
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:15,599
the first place and we figured if it

1688
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:17,519
worked then it would work now and being

1689
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,380
a good German he put a bunch of stuff in

1690
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,719
his bed and it didn't work and we spent

1691
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:23,579
a couple years figuring that out but

1692
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:25,560
we've got a technique

1693
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:28,380
that if you've got a crop that has grown

1694
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,840
with intent for fiber and

1695
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:33,239
grown on you know 3 8 of an inch maybe

1696
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,159
half inch diameter stalks does a very

1697
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:37,139
good job of separating if the crops have

1698
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:38,939
been breaded and properly put up which

1699
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:42,440
we're learning more about that all all

1700
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:46,919
the time we also Farm hemp in Colorado

1701
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:48,779
you know in 2014 2015 when CBD started a

1702
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,000
bunch of people got into it and a bunch

1703
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:53,579
of people got burned so it's a little

1704
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,158
difficult for us to get contract labor

1705
01:15:53,579 --> 01:15:58,019
or contract farming done in Colorado so

1706
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,839
we actually just break ground and farm

1707
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:03,719
it ourselves and then we know

1708
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:07,679
what what we're going to get uh Dr smart

1709
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:10,020
mentioned uh Global fiber I do most of

1710
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,179
the r d for Global fiber and formation

1711
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:14,520
but we've come out with a structural

1712
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:17,640
load-bearing hemp block that is not

1713
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,199
increased its actual structural uh in in

1714
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,719
a cinder block configuration

1715
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:25,019
construction masonry unit it'll hold

1716
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:27,420
2500 pounds per cubic foot normal cinder

1717
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:29,340
blocks are 1500 and we've got three or

1718
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:31,800
four more products it is we keep working

1719
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:33,719
on them that you'll get to see them and

1720
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:37,320
it all starts with this it was is an

1721
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:39,960
evolution in trying to figure out where

1722
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:41,399
can we take the 25 000 uses for it where

1723
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,500
can we make a dollar at it because we

1724
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:45,238
have to pay for all this stuff and and

1725
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,060
we've we've come up with some pretty

1726
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:50,459
Innovative value-add and agricultural

1727
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:52,500
products that we could do with him he

1728
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,420
mentioned the hauling that's a great

1729
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,179
thing I wish more people would eat it

1730
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:58,679
we'd have a lot more dehullers around

1731
01:16:56,179 --> 01:17:01,380
this cinder block deal that we came up

1732
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:03,840
with changes to me changes the Paradigm

1733
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,699
to for agriculture because this is not

1734
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,520
just hundreds of Acres it's tens of

1735
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:11,579
thousands of acres to supply this block

1736
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:14,400
there are 522 billion cinder blocks made

1737
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:17,579
in the US every single year if we took a

1738
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:20,819
tenth of a percent of that market we

1739
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:23,640
would need 690 000 acres of hemp growth

1740
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:25,439
that's a difference I mean that makes a

1741
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:28,380
difference in our area water is a very

1742
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:30,119
big thing conservation of water we can

1743
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:32,400
grow a hemp crop on seven to eight

1744
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:36,899
inches of water where potatoes between

1745
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:38,939
26 and 28 inches of water alfalfas 28 to

1746
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:41,460
32 this year was really hot they went

1747
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:43,919
even more so it's a great technique for

1748
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,600
conserving water and all the other soil

1749
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,899
health benefits that him does for

1750
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:51,600
compaction organic matter Etc but that's

1751
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:55,019
that's why we keep pushing for AG to

1752
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,880
adopt more hemp Acres it's not easy if

1753
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,580
you want to be in him it's dirty Dusty

1754
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,159
nasty frustrating work sometimes but

1755
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:03,658
it's the right thing to do so we think

1756
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,119
that's good work and that's why we keep

1757
01:18:03,658 --> 01:18:10,319
investing our money in it so so this

1758
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:12,059
machine starts with a veil in feed you

1759
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,579
would think that you can just unwind hip

1760
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,440
on a hay bale machine but you can't

1761
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:18,779
turns out we've tried a bunch of them it

1762
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:21,178
doesn't work very well because a hip

1763
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:23,158
prop and any other crop really doesn't

1764
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:24,960
always grow perfectly consistent we

1765
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:26,759
don't have hundreds of years of reading

1766
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,219
and when you drive down the field and

1767
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,659
you see a corn field all the years are

1768
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:32,880
pretty much at the same height they're

1769
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:34,859
almost all the same stature

1770
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,659
doesn't grow like that we have hip

1771
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:38,939
fields that are four feet tall and then

1772
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:39,719
go 20 feet and it's 10 feet tall 12 feet

1773
01:18:38,939 --> 01:18:42,000
tall

1774
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:45,420
so we had to innovate something that

1775
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,359
could handle that and meter the flow of

1776
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:51,239
the material Downstream into the machine

1777
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:54,599
so we came up with this machine and what

1778
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:56,279
it is is it's unrolling the bail kind of

1779
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,500
the opposite direction of as it was

1780
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:00,840
wound up and then we're shearing off a

1781
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:03,238
certain thickness right now it's set for

1782
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,100
an inch and a quarter mat we can go up

1783
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,139
to two or three inches we can go down a

1784
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,780
little bit but we've found an inch and a

1785
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:12,179
quarters roughly where it needs to be so

1786
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:14,460
that the machine can more efficiently

1787
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:16,020
work it's a little counter the thinner

1788
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,359
the mat you feed to this machine the

1789
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:20,400
faster you can run because the the

1790
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:22,259
corticator can do more work on the

1791
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,698
thinner mat that again thicker you'd

1792
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:27,300
think that would be opposite but it's

1793
01:19:23,698 --> 01:19:28,439
not this machine also tips up on the

1794
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:31,500
incline if you need more pressure

1795
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:34,198
against the sharing device but

1796
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,899
that that's that piece of machine in our

1797
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:38,579
facility based ones we put dust hoods

1798
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:40,738
over the top to collect the dust because

1799
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:43,140
our Bales sit outside we live in the

1800
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:45,718
desert sand gets blown into them and it

1801
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:47,520
just creates dust so we we have dust

1802
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:49,140
collection and at altitude dust

1803
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,239
collections are real pain we live at

1804
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:53,640
eight thousand feet so it's kind of a

1805
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:55,139
nuisance 7 700 feet

1806
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,480
the main machine

1807
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:59,100
is up up there open those doors so they

1808
01:19:57,479 --> 01:20:01,500
can see the gearing on it

1809
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,360
it looks simple but that that second

1810
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,698
section right here that he's opening the

1811
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:08,099
doors on that's 12 000 pounds of steel

1812
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:10,678
that's about what it takes to break this

1813
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,000
crop apart the more humid it is the more

1814
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:15,179
work it takes

1815
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,698
so we engineer that those years so that

1816
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:19,260
we can let those Springs compress the

1817
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:20,099
Springs are putting pressure on the

1818
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:23,579
stock

1819
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:25,800
and we're working it gradually as we go

1820
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:28,260
you can't just start decorticating you

1821
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,420
have to break it up get it softer and

1822
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:32,520
then those rollers get faster as it goes

1823
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:34,079
through the machine so not only do we

1824
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,179
kind of break it apart but we're but

1825
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,579
we're brushing the material off of the

1826
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:41,039
herd off of the fiber and that's what

1827
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:42,719
makes that work you can push a button in

1828
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:45,000
the top half of that machine opens up

1829
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,739
because hip made really good rope right

1830
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,840
you hear that about the saline chips and

1831
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:51,000
all that it still makes really good rope

1832
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,579
and if there's a round spot that him can

1833
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,800
wrap on it we'll find it when we start

1834
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:58,380
this thing up we're sitting at about a

1835
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,179
three degree angle away from us and it's

1836
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:02,760
making the fiber run towards the right

1837
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:05,460
hand side of the machine so that's uh

1838
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,140
it's kind of a pain but I bought a jack

1839
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,119
a minute ago and lifted it up we'll see

1840
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:11,400
what it does so that's what the

1841
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:13,619
decorticator looks like and then we

1842
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,859
always had

1843
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:18,899
hurt gets entangled in the fiber this

1844
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:21,539
machine a normal roller breaker can only

1845
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:23,039
stake straight stops but the way we feed

1846
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:25,100
it and the way we've innovated this

1847
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:28,079
machine we can take round bale

1848
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:29,820
unoriented stocks and it actually turns

1849
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:31,619
the stocks as they go through the

1850
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:32,698
machine to brush the herd off but

1851
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:34,319
there's always a little bit of

1852
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:36,479
entanglement between the herd and the

1853
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:38,219
fiber so the next piece we call it a

1854
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:41,519
Shaker table pretty creative name but

1855
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:43,198
that's all we got and it looks like it's

1856
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,480
shaking up and down but it's actually

1857
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,399
the ellipse it throws the material up in

1858
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:48,899
the air material starts to come down

1859
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:50,819
then it impacts the material again

1860
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:53,099
knocks a little bit more of the herd out

1861
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:56,698
it's still not perfect

1862
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:59,039
so that next piece of Machinery is a

1863
01:21:56,698 --> 01:22:01,198
hurt cleaner it's an old piece of

1864
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,420
Machinery we upcycle them we try to be

1865
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:04,859
environmentally friendly we change a

1866
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,440
little bit of the guts on the inside of

1867
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:09,839
it that separates what fiber is left on

1868
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,359
The Herd as best it can

1869
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,640
away from the herd sends the herd down

1870
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:16,439
to the last piece of Machinery the fiber

1871
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,140
that comes out of here goes out to the

1872
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:21,479
we call it short fiber side it's in it

1873
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:23,159
is it's just short fiber but the goal of

1874
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:25,678
the overall machine because we want to

1875
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:28,079
make industrial textiles meaning not

1876
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,819
closed kind of stuff but clothing too we

1877
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:32,279
want as long a fiber as we could

1878
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:33,960
possibly get when you clean and refine

1879
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:36,179
hip fiber down to where you can get it

1880
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,819
to be spun you have to start with a

1881
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:40,560
really long fiber the fibers in these

1882
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:43,679
bags are bundles they're not individual

1883
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:47,699
fibers by far an individual hip fiber is

1884
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:49,619
about 75 80 millimeters long and and I

1885
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:52,019
forget the microns it's you know human

1886
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:53,460
hair thickness it's pretty tiny but to

1887
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,860
get to that you have to start with

1888
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:58,560
really long virus we can always cut

1889
01:22:55,859 --> 01:23:00,658
something down natural fiber right we

1890
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,820
can't make it any longer so this

1891
01:23:00,658 --> 01:23:05,399
technique is geared towards long line

1892
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:07,738
fiber ultimately so that we can make

1893
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:09,658
very strong cordage I came out of

1894
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:11,459
plastic so I call them tape still but

1895
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:13,738
they they call them yarn so you want to

1896
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:16,560
know the yarn count of your fiber right

1897
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:18,539
so when we we break this down we've got

1898
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,760
if if this was a full system there'd be

1899
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:22,800
another semi-trailer sitting here that

1900
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,179
would clean and refine the fiber and

1901
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,159
we're learning more and more about that

1902
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:28,079
all the time we've developed some

1903
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:31,619
techniques where we think well we know

1904
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,300
we can open fiber up to the point where

1905
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:35,640
it can be spun without cartridge chain

1906
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,800
guilds or Combs which is really neat

1907
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,840
nobody's ever done that in the world so

1908
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,699
and that's that's another one of our r d

1909
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,560
projects we're not done with it we

1910
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:45,119
self-fund all this stuff so it takes us

1911
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,640
way longer than it should to innovate

1912
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:49,500
some things sometimes but so we call

1913
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,480
this first build fiber

1914
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:54,060
coming out of the machine on the bottom

1915
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:57,178
is the first milled herd then we clean

1916
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:58,679
the the short fiber off the herd when

1917
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:00,840
the herd comes out of this large gray

1918
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:03,000
machine here it goes into the one that's

1919
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,619
on the nose of the trailer that's going

1920
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,079
to separate it into small medium and

1921
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:10,198
large Parts small is like floor dry

1922
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:12,479
kitty litter things like that the medium

1923
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:14,759
size the way it's set right now is

1924
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:17,399
Builder grade herd or animal bedding

1925
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:18,960
it's half an inch to an inch oversized

1926
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:21,599
product the way we've got set right now

1927
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:24,420
is in inches to inch and a half just the

1928
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,159
way we're transporting it we uh because

1929
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,319
it's on a trailer and we didn't have a

1930
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,599
lot of room we usually use conveyors to

1931
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,099
move the Earth

1932
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,620
but we had to innovate something

1933
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,719
different so we're moving it with air we

1934
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:39,179
don't move the fiber with air especially

1935
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:42,000
when it's long because air turns into

1936
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:44,219
vortex in a tube when you're conveying

1937
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,198
things long fiber turns into a giant

1938
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:48,239
rope and then it becomes very hard to

1939
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:50,099
machine after that so we still use

1940
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:52,259
conveyors until we've broken it down to

1941
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,179
you know six eight inch pieces just

1942
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:56,579
depends on what you're running we do see

1943
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:59,158
white varieties and genetics

1944
01:24:56,579 --> 01:25:02,340
harvesting techniques ready techniques

1945
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:04,859
all Impact decortication so you can set

1946
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,300
yourself up for success by controlling

1947
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:08,460
your farming practice your Harvest

1948
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,980
practice when it comes to that

1949
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:13,140
structural load-bearing bra we're trying

1950
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:14,698
to go from seed all the way to the

1951
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:16,800
finished product to control the spec

1952
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:18,419
because that product will be stamped by

1953
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,420
an engineer that's doing the building

1954
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:24,179
this block the engineers at University

1955
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:26,520
of Nebraska with that load rating say we

1956
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:28,859
can go four stories high and it's a true

1957
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,600
structural deal you still need hempcrete

1958
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:33,658
you still hempcrete is an insulated

1959
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,020
product it's not structural hip Crete is

1960
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:38,698
21 pounds per cubic foot load bear

1961
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:40,739
styrofoam there's nothing there so you

1962
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:43,019
still need that for insulation so the

1963
01:25:40,738 --> 01:25:45,000
whole plant you can still use for

1964
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,620
building material is it's just

1965
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,420
fascinating to me what all we can do

1966
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:49,500
with this product

1967
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:51,060
um

1968
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:53,460
no one else you want to know about it

1969
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,719
but that's kind of the machine that

1970
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,158
really excited to have this thing

1971
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:58,500
running and here it's it's a pretty

1972
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:01,099
unique deal we ran it at our shop we're

1973
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:04,560
really happy with it and trucked it uh

1974
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:06,719
1900 miles over here one thing I do know

1975
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,120
is the US does not build very good roads

1976
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,100
in the mid part of the country so we

1977
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:13,439
spent three days tightening things that

1978
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,719
I never thought we would tighten so but

1979
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:18,599
we did so if something's banging around

1980
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:21,539
that's why because Ohio and Indiana have

1981
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,760
really crappy rooms so New York roads I

1982
01:26:21,539 --> 01:26:25,800
got I told Dr smart one thing I thought

1983
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,659
I would never do is drive my semi east

1984
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,159
of the Mississippi and I was really

1985
01:26:27,658 --> 01:26:31,738
happy with the roads here and he said

1986
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:33,420
yeah because we tax everybody but it

1987
01:26:31,738 --> 01:26:37,319
does work you have great roads here so I

1988
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:38,819
was happy to see that so but I'm sure we

1989
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:40,799
got questions in a group of this side

1990
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:43,139
just feel free to answer ask them all so

1991
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:46,079
I'll do my best it runs standard cinder

1992
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:48,179
block size 8 by 8 by 16 hollow we've run

1993
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:51,000
six by six by one pavers we're around

1994
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:52,920
three by three by eight bricks it is

1995
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,738
formulated and engineered to run on

1996
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:59,060
existing screencast manufacturing lines

1997
01:26:55,738 --> 01:26:59,059
that's how it's formulated

1998
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:03,600
[Music]

1999
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:05,759
we've got three years of time and money

2000
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,920
into that uh and we figured out the

2001
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,440
chemistry of it and it uses no Portland

2002
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,179
cement no sand no aggregate aggregate

2003
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:14,638
think of the hemp is kind of replacing

2004
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:16,970
The Rock Yard it is the West industry

2005
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,079
that we usually find it

2006
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:20,940
[Music]

2007
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:22,559
you know we think it can be done like

2008
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:26,698
that she asked if it could be molded or

2009
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:29,340
3vd printed it flows so yeah if if you

2010
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:31,009
can pump it it can be moved uh it's

2011
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:34,100
amazing it's it's fairly

2012
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:36,420
[Music]

2013
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:39,060
when it comes out of the volumetric

2014
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:41,880
mixers and they vibrate it it flows like

2015
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,260
it's wet still I like water I I don't I

2016
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:45,179
still haven't figured that out either of

2017
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,119
the instructions in your garden but it

2018
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:50,779
flows just like a normal Precast zero

2019
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:50,779
slump cement

2020
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:55,679
yeah yeah well it's we sell the herd and

2021
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,840
the wet chemistry part of it the the

2022
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,179
goal is to license she asked me if it's

2023
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,699
available the goal is to license block

2024
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:04,679
manufacturers

2025
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:07,319
to work with Architects and builders in

2026
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:10,440
in regions and then set up facilities

2027
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:12,658
like this to supply those regions you

2028
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:14,039
know if it's Omaha Nebraska or you know

2029
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:16,019
out here in Cornell I'm sure there's a

2030
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:18,119
Precast company and you've got Farmers

2031
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,800
that want to grow him you fed up set up

2032
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:22,920
a facility you start feeding herd into

2033
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:25,920
that manufacturing plant

2034
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,920
potential

2035
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:32,759
uh some of the short fiber he asked if

2036
01:28:30,658 --> 01:28:34,879
um we send material to Heaven texture

2037
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,860
the short fiber that comes off the back

2038
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:40,619
is is what temperature buys they want

2039
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:43,799
short small fibers for their uh

2040
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:48,358
cellulose bad insulation products

2041
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:48,359
[Music]

2042
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:53,519
Believe It or Not hip is

2043
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:55,139
the the question was uh fire

2044
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,360
preventative measures

2045
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:59,639
you don't cut on this machine you don't

2046
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,158
weld or Grind On It Believe It or Not

2047
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:04,380
hemp dust is not explosive we've sent it

2048
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:07,738
off and had it tested we did that here

2049
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:10,380
too and with the order for Cornell but

2050
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:12,289
it will smolder for about an hour or so

2051
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,560
if it's if it's a spark and then

2052
01:29:12,289 --> 01:29:16,920
[Music]

2053
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:18,659
we've never had a fire knock on wood in

2054
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:21,119
the six years we've been running with

2055
01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:23,339
the corticators in our facility we're

2056
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:26,039
careful to clean heaters we clean light

2057
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:28,020
fixtures we have fire extinguishers

2058
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:30,600
laying around but how come would we've

2059
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:32,880
never had a catch on fire we did have a

2060
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,280
little pile sitting out in the parking

2061
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,500
lot after a rainstorm one day and it got

2062
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,880
hot after that and I I don't know if

2063
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,319
somebody was cutting out there but it

2064
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,539
caught on fire but we've been very

2065
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,340
fortunate not to have it hip does burn

2066
01:29:42,539 --> 01:29:46,260
and when it does it burns really neat

2067
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,279
but it takes a long time and energy to

2068
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,780
get it going

2069
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:49,559
so that that's a great question to

2070
01:29:48,779 --> 01:29:51,359
people

2071
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,300
you know it will burn

2072
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:56,460
when it burns it's hot I mean uh follow

2073
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:59,520
up with that question part of the reason

2074
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,260
why uh this Machinery is mounted on a

2075
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,659
trailer is because

2076
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,880
the Cornell facilities and environmental

2077
01:30:03,658 --> 01:30:07,198
health and safety folks reviewed this

2078
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,619
entire project

2079
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:13,619
came up with specs for the building

2080
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:16,859
that we would need to contain it

2081
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:19,079
to achieve Cornell standards and one of

2082
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:21,420
our Engineers Scott the Hollander is

2083
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:24,840
here who's going to test all this and

2084
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,399
Amy Fox our ehms person is here as well

2085
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,960
uh

2086
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,238
that would have been a more than two

2087
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,000
million dollar facility to construct new

2088
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:38,158
with all of the proper fire and

2089
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,679
explosion Hazard equipment so uh Corbett

2090
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:42,479
Corbett is a

2091
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:44,639
uh

2092
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:46,559
Works in a different regulatory

2093
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:51,359
environment than we do I'll just say

2094
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:53,820
that uh but that is we are only allowed

2095
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:55,679
to operate this machine Outdoors that's

2096
01:30:53,819 --> 01:30:57,539
why it's on the trailer so we are

2097
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,579
building a barn that will protect it

2098
01:30:57,539 --> 01:31:01,738
from the elements and then

2099
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,300
have a little trolley that will build it

2100
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:04,678
that will pull it out of the building

2101
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,960
for operation

2102
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:08,460
of course the other reason to have it on

2103
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,100
trailer is to be able to move it around

2104
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:13,260
the state and we want to bring it to

2105
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,100
Henry Gage in Ulster County

2106
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,840
you want to bring it to uh there's Henry

2107
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:21,000
uh we want we want to bring it to

2108
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,340
Henry's farm and show how it works we

2109
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,460
want to bring it to the North Country we

2110
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:28,500
want to bring it to Western New York

2111
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:31,619
that

2112
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:33,539
let me just say that hopefully within

2113
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:35,158
the month I will be posting an

2114
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:36,420
advertisement for research support

2115
01:31:35,158 --> 01:31:40,559
specialist

2116
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:43,800
to to manage this machine to operate it

2117
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:46,320
and hopefully with a CDL truck driver's

2118
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,119
license so that person can drive it

2119
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:49,619
around the state so if you know of

2120
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:52,019
someone

2121
01:31:49,619 --> 01:31:52,880
an engineer with farming experience as

2122
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:56,340
well

2123
01:31:52,880 --> 01:32:00,800
to operate this machine have them look

2124
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,800
out for that job at this posted

2125
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,840
another couple other questions here yeah

2126
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:10,678
um

2127
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:13,198
bail and how what's the time and what's

2128
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:14,760
the tonnage per day of going through the

2129
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:18,559
system sure

2130
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,560
he's asking is it still on

2131
01:32:21,899 --> 01:32:26,579
now there you go he was asking what is

2132
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:29,400
the weight of this Bale and the

2133
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:33,059
throughput on the machine uh we bail our

2134
01:32:29,399 --> 01:32:36,719
our hemp in five foot round bales and

2135
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:38,280
they're 1100 1200 1300 pounds roughly if

2136
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,439
you make them too loose they don't like

2137
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:42,658
to run very well if you make them two

2138
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,879
thousand pounds if there's any flour

2139
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:46,799
left on them they stick together and

2140
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,340
they're really hard to unwind

2141
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:53,039
so throughput wise figured like this if

2142
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:54,719
you're just running herd the problem

2143
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,420
here is is how do you take away the

2144
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,579
fiber fast enough it'll run you know at

2145
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:01,199
least a ton an hour we've got some

2146
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:03,059
automatic machines to pull the fiber

2147
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:04,339
away we get a ton and a half an hour on

2148
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:06,539
this machine

2149
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:08,460
this would be a slightly slower just

2150
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:11,100
because it doesn't have some of the

2151
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:12,539
extra automation Parts on it there's

2152
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:15,920
another question I want to ask you about

2153
01:33:12,539 --> 01:33:15,920
this stuff yes

2154
01:33:16,859 --> 01:33:22,500
you know we ran he's asking me how much

2155
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:24,238
dust we ran one of one of the Cornell's

2156
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,698
Bales last night

2157
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:29,279
um we live in a desert so this Bale's

2158
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:31,319
got sand in it uh the Bale we ran last

2159
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:33,119
night didn't have a whole lot of Dusty a

2160
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:36,658
bunch of rocks in it but it didn't have

2161
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:38,460
a lot of dust so it varies by how it was

2162
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:40,500
harvested where you store we store all

2163
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:42,359
this stuff outside because we live in a

2164
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,579
desert so it never really gets wet we

2165
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:46,439
get six inches right in here our

2166
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:48,899
facility is in a large potato storage

2167
01:33:46,439 --> 01:33:51,198
Warehouse that we bought if our bills

2168
01:33:48,899 --> 01:33:54,359
get wet we send them up on top of the

2169
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:57,119
culverts and turn on the fan for 10-12

2170
01:33:54,359 --> 01:33:58,920
hours and they're they're down to four

2171
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:01,260
percent moisture which I don't even know

2172
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:03,840
if you hit that low here we try to bail

2173
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:06,600
it at 15 to 18 just like you do a year

2174
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:09,679
north of 18 moisture I would not nail it

2175
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,679
because this stuff will get hot

2176
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,880
question back here sir

2177
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:17,520
I thought I saw another one

2178
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,539
nope the Flies yes sir can you talk a

2179
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,260
little bit about

2180
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:21,420
um

2181
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:22,980
the characteristics of the varieties

2182
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:24,420
that run best through here in terms of

2183
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:26,459
decortication you talk a little bit

2184
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:28,260
about long fibers and one of the things

2185
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:30,239
I'm noticing is there's kind of two

2186
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:32,579
different camps and the fiber varieties

2187
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,379
you got some that have no branching and

2188
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:36,119
some that have lots of branching have

2189
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,319
you noticed like like what are some of

2190
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:39,119
the best characteristics you're looking

2191
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:40,439
for in fiber to run through this the

2192
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:42,619
seed salesman wants to know what

2193
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:44,399
varieties we do right

2194
01:34:42,619 --> 01:34:47,039
no no I just want to talk about

2195
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:48,658
characteristics so characteristics these

2196
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:50,698
are observations that we made over the

2197
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:52,979
years running fiber we've probably

2198
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:55,799
touched more of it than than anybody we

2199
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:57,299
run Chinese stuff Colorado stuff feral

2200
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,940
crops

2201
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:01,380
um growth nodes are a problem the herd

2202
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:03,839
likes to stick where there's a growth

2203
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:06,000
though where there's ranching so

2204
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:10,980
we drill everything on six inch centers

2205
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:13,679
we put in about 450 to 550 000 seats per

2206
01:35:10,979 --> 01:35:16,019
acre that gives us between a quarter

2207
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:18,899
inch diameter stock at 3 8 of an inch

2208
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:21,179
which gives us thick enough herd that

2209
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:22,979
the builders are happy but not enough

2210
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:25,800
growth nodes that we have lots of issues

2211
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:27,959
with the fiber so that tight spacing can

2212
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,119
help reduce the ranching because it

2213
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,679
forces the the buds to go up to try and

2214
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:33,300
get to the sun right they're competing

2215
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,350
with themselves

2216
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,579
um

2217
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:39,120
[Music]

2218
01:35:35,579 --> 01:35:41,279
genetics wise we've run Futura

2219
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:44,880
all the signatures

2220
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:47,759
run really good carbon Yola runs good

2221
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:50,279
I'm not 100 sure what this is our Bales

2222
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,079
are 60 inches this one's 68. so I'm not

2223
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:55,198
sure where this one came from but I

2224
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:57,899
think it's a French variety that was

2225
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:59,339
grown in Nebraska two years ago by one

2226
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:01,219
of our other partners he's got a couple

2227
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,920
sections of ground in Alliance Nebraska

2228
01:36:01,219 --> 01:36:08,158
and uh I think that's one of his fails

2229
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:10,980
but I'm not exactly sure what it is

2230
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,119
um what other genetics would we run

2231
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:16,138
we've run

2232
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:18,599
Yuma we've run the Chinese Yuma there is

2233
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:21,539
a Yuma crossbow that was bred in eastern

2234
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:24,360
Colorado and the guy also made one

2235
01:36:21,539 --> 01:36:28,079
called A1 and A2 and man I wish he would

2236
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:30,899
have not stopped eight one and A2 A1 was

2237
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:33,658
a little hot 8-2 both of those made the

2238
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:37,259
best fiber I've heard and grain that

2239
01:36:33,658 --> 01:36:38,339
we've run and when CBD crashed in 2019

2240
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:40,860
he quit

2241
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:42,420
and we got about a pound of that seed

2242
01:36:40,859 --> 01:36:43,738
left and I don't know how to throw it

2243
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:49,199
out in the greenhouse nor do I have time

2244
01:36:43,738 --> 01:36:51,839
but it is oh yeah but it made we've

2245
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:53,579
taken that fiber to North Carolina to

2246
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,560
their textile School

2247
01:36:53,579 --> 01:36:57,539
and they have spun it and didn't even

2248
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,219
realize it was a dual purpose green crop

2249
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:01,260
right common knowledge says oh it has to

2250
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:03,899
be grown like fiber to be used in

2251
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:05,280
textiles well that's all we had we sent

2252
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:07,079
it to him and he said yeah this stuff's

2253
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:08,880
really great and then we brought some

2254
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:10,439
another little batch with it he said

2255
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,119
well this wasn't Reddit because it's the

2256
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:15,299
colors different we live in the desert

2257
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:16,800
we don't get great and uh he had no idea

2258
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:18,480
he was running that stuff the whole time

2259
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,659
so

2260
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:23,599
I think propagation technique and

2261
01:37:21,658 --> 01:37:26,519
genetics are important

2262
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:29,400
processing technique is almost more

2263
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,920
important in my mind of separating the

2264
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:33,119
fiber and it depends on what you want to

2265
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,579
do with this stuff if you're making

2266
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:37,198
cellulose insulation for for temperature

2267
01:37:35,579 --> 01:37:38,399
you you could probably get away with

2268
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,698
something different and a different

2269
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:44,158
technique than what we have here but

2270
01:37:41,698 --> 01:37:46,799
again we're trying to do

2271
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:50,279
fibers I came out of the Plastics injury

2272
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,619
strain made non-woven and Rochelle knit

2273
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:54,960
products and converted it into fresh

2274
01:37:52,619 --> 01:37:56,698
produce packaging potato bags onion bags

2275
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,158
any bag you buy in the grocery store

2276
01:37:56,698 --> 01:38:01,738
that's got a non-woven mesh on it we

2277
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:04,379
innovated that in in the mesh that it's

2278
01:38:01,738 --> 01:38:06,959
made on so we're trying to do things

2279
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:09,179
like that they consume miles of material

2280
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,319
not yards of material just a little

2281
01:38:09,179 --> 01:38:12,840
different

2282
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:14,880
position in the marketplace because we

2283
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,800
see those as better value-added products

2284
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,319
that will let us take care of the

2285
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,179
farmers better you know if you look at

2286
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:23,819
the diesel price and gas price in the

2287
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:25,679
last few days it jumped up well when

2288
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:29,039
that happens fertilizer will go up we

2289
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:31,319
paid 430 bucks a ton for fertilizer this

2290
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:34,439
year is more last year well what's that

2291
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:36,840
what's that mean is we're paying 300

2292
01:38:34,439 --> 01:38:38,460
we'll probably have to jump to 400 a ton

2293
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,039
to pay the farmers next year to grow it

2294
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:42,420
if we

2295
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:44,519
when we do it ourselves we still have to

2296
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:47,158
pay for land and for fertility and we

2297
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,440
have to pay for water so that that cost

2298
01:38:47,158 --> 01:38:52,319
has to roll down to the farm and without

2299
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:54,419
Farmers participating in this and making

2300
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:55,679
a dollar at it it's really hard to keep

2301
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,539
things going

2302
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,739
so that's really important to take care

2303
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:01,139
of our farm

2304
01:38:58,738 --> 01:39:04,259
so I'm going to cut off questions for

2305
01:39:01,139 --> 01:39:06,900
now uh we have plenty of time over lunch

2306
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:08,219
or to continue asking questions of

2307
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:10,939
Corbett but if you want to get the

2308
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:10,939
machine started

2309
