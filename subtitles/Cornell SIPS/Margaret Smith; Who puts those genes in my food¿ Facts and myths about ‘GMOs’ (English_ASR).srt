1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:15,400
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,198 --> 00:00:16,390
University it's not only the busiest

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,149
even my son

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,219
EF season on a theme park reader so

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:23,919
artist Holly gave my green version right

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:25,960
now so your apology like that but it's

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,699
also the meet when we've been kind

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,980
hearted days these part next those who

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,500
are not in Seneca Falls so my readers

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,750
reason were for max what is incentive

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,200
all is acceptable by the circles around

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,200
the lake

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,120
releasing the fibroid all right

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,300
will terminate in the lightning tour

15
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:51,099
here on this topic I find this uh Cooper

16
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:53,709
those genes my food has been a nod to a

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,039
talk I think many years ago on this

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,679
topic essentially two others written up

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,929
to a garden club that legal - lady star

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,469
club they were very curious very

21
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:06,640
appreciative audience

22
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:06,640
[Music]

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,299
[Music]

24
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:50,089
I think that helps us all important way

25
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,859
to talk about it with other people I

26
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,359
will go through what is genetic

27
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:57,609
engineering and try to put it in the

28
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,609
context of previous and changing our

29
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:04,008
therapy program and then we'll address a

30
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,959
few of what could be making question

31
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,368
concerns and it won't be about starting

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,349
to talk about everything but I hope to

33
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:12,319
hit someone is that relevant to this

34
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:15,709
particular audience so why did much

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,419
university but when a Christian and

36
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,989
engineer crux was grown commercially

37
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:24,229
issues in the mid-1990s around 20 years

38
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:26,239
ago now a lot of the people involved the

39
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,518
industry decision industry as well as

40
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,560
the breeders said oh this is just a

41
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,560
logical extension what managers have

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,239
always time those people have never

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,400
heard of thank you Frank

44
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,269
I thought when I came to Cornell so that

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,140
tells you something

46
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,140
so there's

47
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:43,430
okay so about 2/3 of the people sent

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:47,449
down there go another 11% we're not sure

49
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,580
and a little over a quarter said yes and

50
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,738
there's always we recognize that the

51
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,780
answers should look like that and the

52
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:59,830
line there is maybe that's not just a

53
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,830
circle it's a quite right

54
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:33,560
this is just easily

55
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,099
[Music]

56
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,990
we have concerns we all support

57
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,479
population will always have concerns

58
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,340
sometimes genetic engineering a new tool

59
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,709
for breeding improved crops which is a

60
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,379
process that dates back to domestication

61
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:04,049
by this way humans first began taxes and

62
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,269
years ago tinkering with the genetics of

63
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,560
the crops we grow by choosing which

64
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:09,629
seats to save

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,089
of course you know Gregor Mendel the

66
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:13,829
early readers and our we stood through

67
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:16,859
who I'm about to go to the nursery to

68
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:19,649
exactly the same design be sexy

69
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,840
thirty's some augmented by that thing

70
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:25,079
which this machine gonna do tonight

71
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,938
engineering the best way you want the

72
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,370
message that you have to illustrate what

73
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,830
that difference means was something that

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,930
a colleague at the University of

75
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:38,639
Lausanne put together which one these

76
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:42,168
images james madison wisconsin art from

77
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,158
the mid 1600s and its current a

78
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,198
professional so we looked at this old

79
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:48,478
still life paintings you know the Dutch

80
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,840
masters and all that there is what a

81
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,120
watermelon look like in mid 1600 on the

82
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,339
left the only way of course is a wonder

83
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,250
than that and you ask what makes it so

84
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,549
much - assistant engineer influences Ole

85
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,709
Miss

86
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,228
well the only company this is a

87
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:09,028
consistent product of selection and

88
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:12,628
breeding traditional breeding which of

89
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:15,240
course right so to put this in context

90
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,210
yes it is a new tool for reading through

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,788
Christ but overlaid on the context of

92
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:23,128
proof families change that he was right

93
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:29,519
about the genetics of the crops we use

94
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:31,229
for food the fuel fiber has beauty so

95
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,120
that new tool is a way to change the

96
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:36,439
properties and artists I wouldn't use

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,360
the keyword innocence or actually

98
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:43,019
exists but in a lady that does not

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,030
require sexual cross compatibility I'm

100
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,740
actually a traditional career I live

101
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,839
across my apartment my horn

102
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,850
I think once my initiative is activated

103
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,699
for bacteria and ourselves but I

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,910
remember that genetic engineering allows

105
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,399
you to bypass that cross compatibility

106
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,470
barrier to pull a gene from a bacterium

107
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,639
and can see what we put it in a corn

108
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:07,110
plant okay that's where it's different

109
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,709
let's do the quick review of genetic

110
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:13,590
material DNA experiment the exodus of

111
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:16,949
codebook where all the information you

112
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:19,949
need to do for my TV or our needs to

113
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,659
inform the school it controls the

114
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,990
structure of the organism as well as

115
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,180
when most products are produced it is a

116
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,340
code essentially repeating four letters

117
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,470
four base pairs that form the core of

118
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:35,339
the scanning molecule we have read even

119
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:38,130
ad GMC and amazingly enough that more

120
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,739
than our code does provide every

121
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:51,839
cylinder only all the instructions for

122
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:54,420
what you need to do every second all the

123
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:59,729
instructions

124
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:04,030
please give talks for other conferences

125
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,910
and not too many departments and

126
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:08,679
ethicists this cohesive member so

127
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,350
imagine that all that approach if you

128
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:16,530
come for healthy babies or a tentative

129
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:20,050
or a human or so a tree or wing or lives

130
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,869
every single organism uses essentially

131
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,930
the same government that in personally

132
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,060
is why genetic engineering works someone

133
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,060
could take a gene from that bacteria and

134
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,299
plug it into a soybean plant into the

135
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,120
soybean plant it's just more 80 GS and

136
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,599
C's more instructions so as the

137
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,060
machinery that we coated the soybean

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,759
plant comes to that gene

139
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,039
it doesn't say here's something from the

140
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,659
bacteria all that C's is more

141
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:53,110
instructions written in the same

142
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:55,120
commitment in Isis and it would be if

143
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,639
Sunil were writing a piece of literature

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,769
and said you know this part is grab

145
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,659
there's all the club that lessons

146
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,149
automatic enough so we cut out a piece

147
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:06,100
that's in exceedingly Don then paste it

148
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,740
in there there nice person that needs

149
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,909
that it's not going to say nearly 2/3

150
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,620
witness it's when the one planet was

151
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:17,029
all the time okay too quickly new

152
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,220
traditional crossbreeding

153
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,079
across to Paris the offspring like their

154
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,690
kids of a mix of traits from the two

155
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,970
parents genetic engineering that they've

156
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,770
challenged in some ways is to find an

157
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,200
actual gene that would be useful to have

158
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,600
no claims but then hire rather complex

159
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,090
process you stick that gene into your

160
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,180
plan a lot of some sequences that make

161
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:41,090
sure you it gets expressed whenever you

162
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,879
wanted to so genetic engineering plant

163
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:47,000
and one pair of people genes and into a

164
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,220
particular parent as opposed to be mates

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,269
of the new parents they were crossed to

166
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,240
make a traditional cross traffic light

167
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:57,980
so genetically produce go all the way

168
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,960
back to the mastication this is my

169
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,420
organism this is its wild ancestor

170
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,360
teosinte not very similar when they

171
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:07,459
might be partners all will be grown

172
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,430
selected different types of that

173
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,800
organism ease to fit their particular

174
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:14,419
niches I love this

175
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,549
these are things we think of as

176
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:19,879
completely different vegetables broccoli

177
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:22,669
cauliflower kale kohlrabi cabbage

178
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:25,519
brussel sprouts they all trace back to

179
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:27,829
exactly the same ancestral mustard

180
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,110
plants different people in different

181
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,540
places selected for different medical

182
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,009
clinic parts and the ward you've got

183
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:37,669
that poor girl

184
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:40,220
a large departure platter effects or

185
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:42,079
leaves or stems or lateral loads like

186
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,180
the Brussels sprouts and of course

187
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,460
traditional cross breeding and genetic

188
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:48,709
engineering when I say humans have

189
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,930
profoundly altered the genetics of our

190
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:54,080
Oxford thousands of years this is what I

191
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:57,079
mean because reading farmers choosing to

192
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,379
save seed to farmers selecting and

193
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,420
savings and cultivated crops to breeding

194
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:07,700
that's why on 450 years

195
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:10,309
- gingy so when imagine your crops that

196
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,180
are out there three big categories and a

197
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:15,469
few less or newer and less on the ground

198
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,929
ones first

199
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,019
et claps which have a gene from what you

200
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:23,239
thought they all recognized as a

201
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,429
bacterial insecticide the solicitor in

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,250
Genesis so this their size and a number

203
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:32,389
of other things the gene that produces a

204
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:35,570
protein that inside an insect alkaline

205
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:38,389
gut is converted kind of man to a toxin

206
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,250
was really from the bacterium and put

207
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,769
into some of these crops to make that

208
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,899
insect resistant you may need to drop

209
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,929
your mind because you have an exit exit

210
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,789
so do all mammals and birds certain

211
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:52,579
insects I mean did they assume that

212
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:55,250
protein the gene produces and it becomes

213
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,620
a toxin that alkalyn got environments

214
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,360
and that is what control

215
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,700
secondly Kenworthy herbicide resistant

216
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,769
crops most studies on that already

217
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,139
resistant like say although there are

218
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:10,509
other site resistances coming along

219
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:13,360
again this isn't even actually a pretty

220
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,639
soil bacteria that last plan to detoxify

221
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,600
on its underside that would otherwise be

222
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:23,110
toxic to it and the movie category virus

223
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,480
resistant classy planet and SWAT unit to

224
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,730
the nightmare like this is genetic

225
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,620
engineered virus resistant papaya and

226
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,329
this is compliant that is not resistant

227
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,169
so you can see quite effective

228
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:38,049
that one is created by taking the gene

229
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:41,319
that makes the protein coat of the virus

230
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:43,208
a virus is a protein come with a little

231
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,720
piece of genetic material inside that's

232
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,649
all it is

233
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,870
and in that genetic material is one gene

234
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:52,659
that produces the protein so the virus

235
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,000
to make itself comes okay you take the

236
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:57,458
gene to the coat how could you use their

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,070
car someplace to get disease you move it

238
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:02,759
into the plants and it's essentially

239
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,540
like what we do when we get accident it

240
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,819
essentially

241
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:10,838
against infection that matters so the

242
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:15,110
plant produces proteins for fighters

243
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:17,240
members there are few more distinct root

244
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,100
of the medicine elements are one of

245
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,289
those three the BT in the identity or

246
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,930
psychosis and the viruses has been

247
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:26,778
around for a long time or recently you

248
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,169
have numerous hypotheses about why in a

249
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:30,679
moment

250
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:34,699
we have produced women out Batho so this

251
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:38,599
should develop to be v6 engine stability

252
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,790
is feed we have the potato that's been

253
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,430
engineered for less than this black spot

254
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:45,349
bruise over here lesson for my

255
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:48,019
production and like like resistance

256
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,440
several versions of that and we have not

257
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:54,549
recommended this one together particle

258
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,160
which you can cut them it doesn't right

259
00:13:54,549 --> 00:14:00,019
now I want to sit me you see reduce Lima

260
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,789
not well with a potato and Apple these

261
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,620
are police on the first trips that

262
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:07,549
strike you as something directed

263
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,950
consumer quality okay the black spot

264
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:12,049
there's kind of a consumer issue the

265
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,330
acrylamide production

266
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:17,699
consumer issue the non-driving Apple

267
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,860
more appealing to consumers and the

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:25,500
reduce leaving out the consumers in that

269
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:27,960
case our past tradition to the

270
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,549
engineering side we haven't even hit

271
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:36,990
this forehead and I'm not sure I'll have

272
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:39,359
today I want to talk to this audience

273
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,100
particularly about vegetables fruits of

274
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,200
our dimensions to see you know a lot of

275
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,810
this is in the fields perhaps early huh

276
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,520
but there have been a series of Google's

277
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,319
so when you can approval to

278
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,329
commercialize your genetic engineered

279
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:58,379
version of the crop from three agencies

280
00:14:53,330 --> 00:15:00,300
the USDA yes part to that question in

281
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,490
order to be sure there's not a new pest

282
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,289
problem created by that car the

283
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,080
Environmental Protection Agency which

284
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:09,689
was to things like label like the safe

285
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,759
for you son Toxocara killed but they're

286
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,980
genetically engineered resistance okay

287
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,439
so the EPA and the Food and Drug

288
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,139
Administration which is responsible for

289
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,420
food and eating wait not those three

290
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,139
approvals you get what's called

291
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,509
deregulation or approval to

292
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,389
commercialize that Hawk without special

293
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,919
regulations so these are starting

294
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,799
England

295
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,319
all the approvals it's just the number

296
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,359
of approvals in a given year for things

297
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,089
which would be considered vegetable

298
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,360
fruits or ornamental there is a big

299
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:43,519
space early on the tomato the flavor

300
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,259
secret tomato was actually the first

301
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
genetic engineered crop and lots of

302
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:50,569
different versions of it recruited and

303
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,429
then we're a few young squashes here

304
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,970
those lattice resistance washings

305
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:58,370
a few potatoes here but papaya had the

306
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:04,420
virus resistant papaya and then kind of

307
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:07,850
a desert here until pops resistant plum

308
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:11,629
another papaya patterns this one right

309
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:14,509
here is the balloon rose which is been

310
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:17,179
proven elements we use and then another

311
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:19,669
reason this is 2014 to 2017

312
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,528
a recent collection that includes that

313
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,528
new version of the particular material

314
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:26,778
reduces acrylamide black spot personally

315
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:31,009
light resistance as well as if you are

316
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:32,809
to happen to preventing contact ii put

317
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:34,879
some stars on this picture and what the

318
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:36,409
stars represent is the numbers so this

319
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,750
is the numbers for vegetable fruit

320
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,850
ornamentals the stars are the numbers

321
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,919
from being pressed so you see they

322
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,199
tracked fairly similarly here at the

323
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,778
beginning but then where the the things

324
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,179
that are directly tied to consumers

325
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:52,519
vegetables fruits

326
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:55,489
right off we send a lot of field crops

327
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,679
activity really a month and now there's

328
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,740
certain catching up again so I think the

329
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:03,500
public response costs the people that

330
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,269
are producing fruit vegetables and less

331
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,670
ornamentals I think there's just as much

332
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:10,039
work there to that well for this

333
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:15,050
technology because after all we don't

334
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:17,779
see them ourselves to see but we should

335
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:28,669
only eat it able to karriesue peppers

336
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:36,859
and some responsibility through some

337
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:38,750
questions and concerns there are a lot

338
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:41,479
of estimates and estimates vary

339
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,609
dramatically so if you talk to you from

340
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,410
the really large seed industry any of

341
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:48,169
your estimates that include millions of

342
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:50,509
dollars if you talk to Okanagan

343
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,519
specialty fruits the develop the Arctic

344
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:55,150
echo that's where exciting company in

345
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,970
Canada they got us approval and then

346
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,970
2,200

347
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,150
so explore the depends on how many where

348
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,940
oh right there is a fair amount of

349
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:18,700
Hey look at all so it's not if there's

350
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:20,740
no more than which is stupid so I will I

351
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,789
will say this about crisper so

352
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,890
Christopher is a technology for bringing

353
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:29,259
about genetic change in a much more

354
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,780
targeted way and the two things that

355
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:34,000
lets you do differently from traditional

356
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:37,869
genetic engineering which is cut many

357
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,019
magnificent in that basically somewhere

358
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:43,619
at random and hoping to find one where

359
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,549
he didn't randomly disrupt genes plant

360
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,339
instruction okay

361
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,859
that's genetic engineering CRISPR allows

362
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:53,139
you to target exactly where in the

363
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:56,169
genetic material of that croc who wants

364
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,860
to make a change and then either do one

365
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:02,980
of two things create random change at

366
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,569
that spot so you identify perhaps who

367
00:19:02,980 --> 00:20:01,240
uses an example

368
00:19:04,569 --> 00:20:10,500
this flower color of those those are the

369
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:12,849
source ultimately variation we all have

370
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,278
small genetic differences from each

371
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:18,699
other and those traits like to copy the

372
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:21,519
scenes most of those are not useful but

373
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,150
here is where you can create a faster

374
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:28,980
rate of

375
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:30,509
virgin okay the other thing is a mirror

376
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,519
image of genetic engineering

377
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:35,309
you can cause a break in a particular

378
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,220
apartment in a but then give the plants

379
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,589
a template that includes a new gene so

380
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,370
that whatever cares that way giving or

381
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:46,769
it's the new G so this we can be used to

382
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:50,099
do genetic engineering it can also be

383
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:53,700
used to create randomly change the

384
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:56,399
random change what there is nothing you

385
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,410
can measure on those plants it will tell

386
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,690
you this was a result spec to be Chris

387
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:07,380
burg versus waiting around on

388
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:10,259
permutations so figure out what to do

389
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,240
with that there is something that can do

390
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:31,500
actually look at a plant and verify

391
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:33,630
whether it's a mutation or the USDA is

392
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,759
struggling they're reworking their

393
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:39,480
regulations right now that is in

394
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:42,690
question the European Union Justice nest

395
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,849
within the past week decided that yes

396
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,190
Chris Kirk is going to be regulated as

397
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:48,689
genetically engineer so different places

398
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,220
have different regulations and they are

399
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,220
all struggling with acting

400
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,269
[Music]

401
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:12,609
yeah

402
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,170
[Music]

403
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:01,719
[Music]

404
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,640
yeah so that's that's one of the things

405
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,529
that people are debating now and would

406
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,509
it be more acceptable to people if you

407
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:27,759
just use for example it whispered a

408
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:29,140
pretty variation with industry seems

409
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,349
rather than reaching beyond those

410
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,720
boundaries but you know I have no senses

411
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:37,299
there are people hurt when that will be

412
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,250
reassuring sound and accidentally

413
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,169
consuming something from a bacterium and

414
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,869
I thought it was just eating food and

415
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,210
never mind that in nature that does

416
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:47,889
happen there's well bacteria and viruses

417
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:57,120
that we know can insert their genetic

418
00:23:47,890 --> 00:24:00,690
material for sure yeah yeah we're stuck

419
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:03,719
that's marketing I absolutely hurt that

420
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,279
moment some of these are people who

421
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,809
would be reassured by that and then

422
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,609
there are feeling we'll just think oh

423
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,740
now they're taking this technology

424
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:12,779
actually look like and are putting it in

425
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,450
products where I can't even tell you

426
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:22,319
know there's this except if it works and

427
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:24,269
Destin anyways so that so you know I'm

428
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,369
just going to say I'm I'm having issues

429
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:29,150
answering questions at this point if

430
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:29,149
that works for you

431
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,109
[Music]

432
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:49,220
population yeah

433
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,519
beats are not one of the insects that is

434
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,798
affected by the bacillus thuringiensis

435
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:56,058
so consequently that person doesn't

436
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,918
really affect me either

437
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:59,619
that's one of the reasons people really

438
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,210
like it what is an organic insecticide

439
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:05,569
as a conventional insecticide and

440
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,029
message many different races its action

441
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:10,879
spectrum is pretty narrative confined to

442
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:17,470
the lettuce the characters come and the

443
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:29,270
peels and different duties work on

444
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:33,589
particular species so I guess what I was

445
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:36,289
wondering about is there's a great lack

446
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:39,019
of understanding of all of this and

447
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:42,829
there's a lot of emotion in it and so

448
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:45,019
what what does Cornell do to address

449
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:47,418
that because I think at Cornell we have

450
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,859
people who are absolutely pro GMO and I

451
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:52,490
think there's a lot of people who are

452
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:54,319
probably absolutely against it and

453
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,308
that's what we could all do but this

454
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,859
Cornell have programs that that that

455
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,920
that interpret this and extend it out I

456
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:05,309
mean can you

457
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,710
on those issues that is a variety people

458
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:13,349
that point out - speaking publishing

459
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:15,539
educating is educational so i services

460
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:18,539
our goal is to help people understand

461
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:21,029
the technology and what both its risks

462
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:22,200
ended its benefits and risks are because

463
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:24,930
there are a lot of people talk about

464
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,090
only one or only together our job is not

465
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:29,009
to take sides but to help people

466
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:32,009
understand it so they can make a better

467
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:33,509
important choice of their own I think

468
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,549
the other thing that is my

469
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:39,690
responsibility here is to be as

470
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:42,990
thoughtful as we can about where that

471
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,289
has arisen I live so I say that as a

472
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,819
scientist you know it comes back to me

473
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:49,859
because they and I was speaking to an

474
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,529
audience it was a competitive way

475
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:54,750
without genetic engineer crops and food

476
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,970
safety which is always a big concern to

477
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,349
people since I'm not going to get to

478
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,079
those slides I'll just say right now

479
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:03,569
that scientifically there's no evidence

480
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,939
of any of the commercialized genetic

481
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:08,490
engineered crops have anything about

482
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,789
risks related to food safety but one of

483
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:15,420
the roots of the put in up here

484
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:17,700
exactly right rady stricken and at the

485
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,730
end and said so how do we know this

486
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,680
isn't the next tranche as you know it

487
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,680
it's a really good question because

488
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,230
we've had a history but many exams

489
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,150
were developed because people willing to

490
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,670
be theta might be better for us

491
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,650
what about people's over there you know

492
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,060
we didn't apply CFCs where the spray

493
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,180
that we just made a really good

494
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:41,879
interpretation so sometimes things need

495
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,710
tying to find so I would just say

496
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,200
however as scientists it's also a

497
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,329
combination to have a certain degree of

498
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,150
humility and a huge degree of

499
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:55,490
forethought fullness to see as best we

500
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:56,970
can where the problems might live and

501
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,819
that's it

502
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,539
y'all should also know nobody funds

503
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:08,240
research that will examine unintended

504
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:18,420
consequences so how do you do that

505
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:22,470
design so that there there is the edge

506
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:25,220
may inherit examination of data looks

507
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,900
quite carefully at potential

508
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,390
and they have you know a fair amount

509
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,940
about that leaders you know you know

510
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,130
with major allergen to certain kind of

511
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,500
structures and and families of chemicals

512
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,470
that I tend to see together today the

513
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:43,490
other thing they do is they always know

514
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:46,880
tax data or in vitro so in a petri dish

515
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:49,880
great breakdown with human digestive

516
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,120
enzymes then the argument there is if it

517
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,980
breaks down any more slowly than in the

518
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,699
normal routine that you would find

519
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,380
that's a red flag simply because the

520
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,480
longer something is in your digestive

521
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,160
system the more chance you have to have

522
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,339
any kind of a reaction to it whether

523
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,860
it's Jennifer just irritation plan so

524
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:11,449
things that break down people only get

525
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:13,339
red-flagged and they will not be

526
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,220
approved until that is examined and

527
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:18,379
understood so that's in a bit the

528
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,539
emergency question I think is handled

529
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,610
probably the best weekend with that

530
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:24,609
because the only way to really help

[Music]

533
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:18,859
we do get to hybrids that don't

534
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,930
propagate truth you know they think you

535
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:24,469
could say this even in work is mass

536
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:26,539
right I know there are also several is

537
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,789
particularly in ornamentals we're going

538
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:30,589
to say clever more they're necessarily

539
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:33,349
trying to exceed so they just eat

540
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:38,389
whatever so he said you can read to

541
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:41,359
sterols there is any genetically

542
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:45,650
controlled the sterile traits to genetic

543
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,479
control so we put it absolutely both by

544
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:51,410
reading organization and engineering

545
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:54,110
change that we don't yet have a good way

546
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:56,860
thank heavens breathing truth that you

547
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:56,859
know strangely

550
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,960
better than I can

551
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,849
I don't know and I don't know how to

552
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,289
incite questions until someone gets

553
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:59,569
something approved that they actually

554
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:01,159
want to try my understanding at the

555
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:03,079
Bluebird oversees that it isn't simply

556
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,470
that great color and so really doesn't

557
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:08,179
announce right but I would also say that

558
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,410
there's a lot of scope for three

559
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:15,289
different colors and then finally say

560
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,690
I'm smart you under the table because in

561
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:20,289
Section plans they have to sell to each

562
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,289
one of us

[Music]

564
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:15,240
so here is the intersection it must be

565
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:18,029
broken on that vehicle right along with

566
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,599
many of them requirements and that is

567
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:24,750
true but the fact that it's not genetic

568
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,519
engineer just saw a matinee again so get

569
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,089
away this is quick but you know there's

570
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,299
a

[Music]

572
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,009
what we're looking at in their part are

573
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,080
they want for beauty but it's nothing

574
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:45,750
that affects their health unless they're

575
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:49,029
planning my papers so I think there's no

576
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,849
surprises in reality and it does it's

577
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,019
maybe wonder for a long time about

578
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:55,179
engineering or nonetheless because I

579
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:58,839
think that with the area where they're

580
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:03,310
less concerned the original concept was

581
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:07,599
in ornamental it was a pine tree and in

582
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:09,579
engineering it was marketed never even

583
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,009
necessarily have to plant I don't know

584
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:15,099
but they engineer different issue from

585
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:17,140
the fiberglass the luciferase gene and

586
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:19,239
if the lipstick race team and the fire

587
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,279
plane has the right chemical to work on

588
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:23,648
it will produce lights so they've done

589
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,530
that you need to the plankton and if you

590
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:28,679
watered it with the right chemical rusev

591
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:33,899
planting the tree fruit lights

[Music]

593
00:34:43,750 --> 00:35:22,690
I will say is very cruel process right

594
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:26,260
now so this that process they're going

595
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:28,450
to string that doesn't produce what's

596
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:31,050
the cost the actual genetic engineering

597
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:31,049
which is
