1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,599
University

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:09,869
yeah well thank you very much thanks for

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,048
inviting me and it's really nice to be

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:15,028
back here and see so many familiar faces

6
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:16,920
I'm going to tell you today about a

7
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:20,009
research project that I have been

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,880
working on in Beltsville for a little

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,789
while and and the titles here basically

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:30,059
we wanted to look at how microbial

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,910
systems respond to the application of

12
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:37,969
glyphosate in a variety of farming

13
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:41,339
systems so our objectives are to compare

14
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:43,229
factors in modern carp farming systems

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,210
or cropping systems that impact soil

16
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,549
microbial communities plant microbe

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,109
interactions and plant health now this

18
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:54,929
modern soil cropping systems that's like

19
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:59,000
political code word for systems that use

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:04,140
a whole range of technologies including

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,259
glyphosate and Roundup Ready technology

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,269
GMO technology so USDA monitors

23
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:14,909
herbicides that are that are registered

24
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:18,449
by the EPA we monitor them regularly and

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,899
a lot of times will initiate experiments

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,950
based on comments that are sent in to

27
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:28,618
the secretary from from constituents and

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,420
there was in the in the last well 15

29
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,938
years or so the secretary has been

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,069
getting a lot of mail about glyphosate

31
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:39,858
and some concerns about privacy so just

32
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:43,049
a really quick review glyphosate is a

33
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:44,998
compound that blocks the Shakima Cassatt

34
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,939
pathway and this pathway is is

35
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:49,438
critically important for amino acid

36
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,888
production as well as a bunch of

37
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:56,428
secondary compound production the

38
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:59,278
Roundup Ready gene is a bypass for that

39
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:02,929
blockage so if you apply glyphosate and

40
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:02,929
you have the Roundup Ready gene you can

41
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:10,739
how the system basically works and it

42
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,610
was the first herbicide GMO system that

43
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,020
was packaged in the US

44
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,630
so it's a very popular compound it's

45
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,250
applied to about 90 percent of 98

46
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:25,879
percent of the corn and soybean in the

47
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,310
US and that's in the 90 or so 95 million

48
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,280
acres of each of those depending on the

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,990
year so you can see that there's a fair

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,810
amount of it applied to the landscape

51
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,969
and so we're very interested in what the

52
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,180
impact of this may be in the large scale

53
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:43,389
and you can see over time the popularity

54
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,129
and the use of it has increased is the

55
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:50,689
proportional use of glyphosate among

56
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:52,069
many different types of pesticides so

57
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,539
there's been some issues about the

58
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,549
impact that was like to say for a number

59
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,939
of years then you've probably heard

60
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,939
about some of them herbicide resistance

61
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:04,789
is a big one and this map here below has

62
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:09,020
has six panels starting in 2002 going to

63
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:11,780
2012 in which it shows the the states

64
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,670
that have the number of glyphosate

65
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,939
resistant plant species in the states

66
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:19,189
and you can see that it's like it's

67
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:22,849
increasing year by year or two - year by

68
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:24,620
year oh sorry there's um there's some

69
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:27,139
concern that there's a there's a yield

70
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,390
hit when glyphosate is applied and this

71
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,089
may be a function of multiple mechanisms

72
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:36,589
and that that is an area of research

73
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,909
that's being conducted right now and the

74
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,280
main thing that we're gonna focus on

75
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,409
here is the effects on plant disease

76
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,060
ecology and really really just looking

77
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,310
at some of the organisms that might be

78
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,110
responsible for diseases and not

79
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,239
necessarily doing a pathological

80
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,239
screening of these of these cracker

81
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,349
plants so there's been a lot of debate

82
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,539
about this impact of glyphosate on plant

83
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:03,409
diseases and and there and these are

84
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:05,060
just a few titles from papers papers

85
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,310
that talk about the effects in the

86
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,039
rhizosphere interactive mostly

87
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,830
interaction with rhizosphere compounds

88
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:16,909
as well as interaction with metals in

89
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,799
the in the soil manganese as a was an

90
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,010
issue and then there's been some sort of

91
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,329
rebuttals to that talking about the this

92
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,180
paper is mostly based on the

93
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,319
stoichiometry of application and how

94
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,780
much actual

95
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,360
you add to the soil relative to the

96
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:35,239
amount of other things in the soil and

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,379
this this is pretty well done study so

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,280
there's been a lot of debate out there

99
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:42,889
and we were partially because of well

100
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,659
and one of the main figures that was

101
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:49,699
constantly referred to was this figure

102
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:52,760
from Kramer and means trims up out in

103
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:56,149
Purdue and this this study would they

104
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,259
have produced many figures that look

105
00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:03,829
like this you apply glyphosate at at

106
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:07,779
time zero and within say 40 days 50 days

107
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:11,329
you have significantly more Fusarium

108
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:14,119
colonies growing cerium is a wilt

109
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:16,789
disease that's that's that's fairly

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,180
ubiquitous in cropping systems but in

111
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,319
this case the claim was that these type

112
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,560
of user was was pathogenic and was

113
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,209
building up in the soil in all of these

114
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,629
millions and millions of acres of corn

115
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,729
and soybean so we were asked to sort of

116
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:37,610
review some of this literature and look

117
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,890
back at the at what was done to try to

118
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,090
that that came to these conclusions and

119
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:46,069
and asked this question if see if we

120
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:49,129
could revisit this question does a does

121
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:53,719
the application like shift the

122
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:59,110
composition and function of the soil of

123
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,110
the of the root end of soil microbes

124
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,120
does the presence of the Roundup Ready

125
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:10,300
gene in a crop cause a shift in the

126
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,620
microbial community associated with and

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,009
does the legacy of glyphosate

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,199
application like and we we decide on

129
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,870
plus ten year greater than ten years

130
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:25,550
does that contribute to the differences

131
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:28,280
in route associated microorganisms so we

132
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,970
did we did this study at multiple

133
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:35,359
locations and looking at both bacteria

134
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:37,370
fungi and in a sub experiment nematodes

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,740
but I'm just going to focus on the fungi

136
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,800
and this is a picture of Fusarium

137
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,960
forming

138
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,908
okay so we're we did this experiment or

139
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,519
the site I'm going to talk about today

140
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:54,680
is the USDA Beltsville farming systems

141
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:57,370
project and it's one of only it's one of

142
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,959
just a few long-term farming systems

143
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,990
projects in this in the country that

144
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,839
compare some sort of conventional

145
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,689
tillage a no tillage and organic systems

146
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,728
all at the same site and all that we're

147
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,968
sort of experimentally designed to be

148
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:16,968
compared this is in the Chesapeake Bay

149
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:19,029
watershed so many of the issues related

150
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:21,769
to Chesapeake Bay eutrophication are

151
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:24,098
applicable to the practices that we

152
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:26,000
carry out here and so we abide by the

153
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:28,759
phosphorus standards that have been

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,180
implemented by Maryland State as well as

155
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,310
any EPA or national standards these

156
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,439
plots were established in 1996 and the

157
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,050
field was no-till for 11 years before

158
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:41,718
that so they did no-till to try to sort

159
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,168
of normalize things and then impose

160
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:47,778
these these plots the way it's laid out

161
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:50,180
we did a I didn't do it I was here at

162
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:52,370
the time but they they did a very an

163
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,900
extensive spatial survey of this whole

164
00:07:52,370 --> 00:08:00,528
entire field and based on physical and

165
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:02,750
biochemical attributes of block this out

166
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,370
Laurie did you were you did you help in

167
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,959
doing this

168
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:12,769
initially with dr. raping horse from

169
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:15,680
Laurie has helped over over over time so

170
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:18,579
I wasn't sure done by dr. Ravin horses

171
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,019
University of Maryland and this is how

172
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:24,288
how we decided or they decide to block

173
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:26,209
it out and this is what the farm looks

174
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:30,110
like there's like slight rolling hills

175
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:34,028
this is a wheat crop here that's a major

176
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:40,459
highway right back there the plots are

177
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:43,838
30 feet wide and 390 feet long we we use

178
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:46,250
full-size tractors and and 10-foot

179
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,290
implement 10-foot wide implements to

180
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,759
plant where we actually got a 30 foot

181
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:53,539
planter now we're going to plant in one

182
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,519
one run now and so that's just a kind of

183
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:56,289
a view of what

184
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,509
looks like so so I'm gonna I'm gonna

185
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:00,219
sort of zoom into this area to show you

186
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,830
the plot layout so you get an idea of

187
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,080
how the experiment was designed so we

188
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,340
have we're in this what I'm talking

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,520
about today I'm going to be comparing

190
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,440
four different systems no-till system

191
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,649
and a chisel tool system they both are

192
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,060
three-year rotation corn soybean wheat

193
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,340
mineral fertilizer and herbicides and

194
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:20,500
there's two organic systems either a

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,450
three-year or a six year rotation the

196
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,240
three years corn soybean wheat and then

197
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,730
a hairy vetch and the six years corn

198
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,700
soybean wheat and then it goes into

199
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,670
three years of alfalfa and they both

200
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:37,810
have legume animal manure and we use

201
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:40,539
cultural practices to suppress weeds so

202
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:42,489
if we zoom in on this is just rep three

203
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:45,610
what you'll see is the different systems

204
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,919
that we have compared here every system

205
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,450
is composed of subplots and the reason

206
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,870
we have subplots there is because we

207
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,930
have every phase present every year so

208
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,120
corn soybean wheat for a three-year

209
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:01,120
rotation and then now FAL I mean in the

210
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,830
six year rotation we'd have corn soybean

211
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,840
wheat alfalfa alfalfa alfalfa and so we

212
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,480
can compare any phase of the rotation

213
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,820
and control for all the weather for that

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,370
particular year which is nice and that

215
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,560
will come into play a little bit later

216
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm not going to be talking about the

217
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,369
organic to system today and that's kind

218
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,310
of like a foil it's really a bad system

219
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,840
because corn soybean corn soybean and

220
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:31,419
it's terrible it's really good at

221
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:34,180
producing weed seeds so within these

222
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:36,399
plots I set up micro plots and what we

223
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,089
have to pay attention here and I fail to

224
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,980
leave again

225
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,030
but these three micro plots right here

226
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,420
is what we're looking at today we have a

227
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:48,970
a Roundup Ready corn genotype that's

228
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:52,599
sprayed a Roundup Ready corn genotype

229
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,970
that's not sprayed and a in a isoline of

230
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,580
the Roundup Ready corn so it's the same

231
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,920
exact genotype but just without the RR

232
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,660
gene in it and then we have the same

233
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,569
thing for soybean we have the Roundup

234
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:07,549
Ready soybean sprayed not sprayed and

235
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,410
then the isoline and so when

236
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:12,319
we're comparing sprayed and not sprayed

237
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:14,149
we can control for time in the season by

238
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,339
comparing the sprayed and the not

239
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,500
sprayed of the same genotype that have

240
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:22,209
that have sort of moved through time

241
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,860
together and then as a secondary

242
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:28,578
comparison we can compare the Roundup

243
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,860
Ready genotype to the isoline to get at

244
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:38,028
whether or not the single gene in there

245
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:40,339
is making any difference so this is just

246
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:45,289
a close-up to show you those those those

247
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:47,450
plots they're 30 the main plots are 30

248
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,909
feet wide 390 feet long we did that

249
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,759
every the micro plots are 10 feet wide

250
00:11:49,909 --> 00:12:02,000
by 20 feet long and we harvested the

251
00:11:52,759 --> 00:12:04,370
middle two rows so we we we looked at

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,578
corn and soybean here to heart we

253
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:11,539
harvested 15 centimeter monoliths at two

254
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:15,289
dates of vegetative 5 and reproductive -

255
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:18,819
so we basically a vegetative 5 we

256
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:24,110
sampled and then spray glyphosate and

257
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:27,649
then about 25 days later at R 2 we came

258
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,950
in and did this again so we have right

259
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,990
before glyphosate is applied and then 25

260
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,420
days after glyphosate is applied and

261
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,389
that was done for each crop each genus

262
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:41,088
type and for monoliths per plot and of

263
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:43,699
course that was replicated so we

264
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,910
isolated bulk and rhizosphere soils we

265
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,270
we broke the bulk soil away and then

266
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:53,419
brushed the rhizosphere soil we played

267
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:55,909
it at we wash them or wash them snip

268
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:58,278
them and then we actually surface

269
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:01,819
sterilized them and then plated them out

270
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:06,320
to on Kumada selective media and select

271
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,149
the media for Fusarium and this part

272
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,510
here is really replicating what was done

273
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:14,750
in the literature and then we we did a

274
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:17,539
lot of soil biochemistry phospholipid

275
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,458
fatty acids and we did sequencing on 16s

276
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,860
and i TS sequencing we did some

277
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,539
additional analysis which I'll talk

278
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,269
a little bit later and this some of this

279
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:28,429
is ongoing and then with the plants we

280
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:32,120
also did some plant biochemistry yield

281
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:35,828
and and did some of some more specific

282
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,709
sort of analysis of symbiotic bacteria

283
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:43,639
so folks so looking at the at the a

284
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:46,759
plating score so we scored over 6100

285
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,980
root segments we ID'd over 2,400

286
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,470
colonies my lab was just like it just

287
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,870
was full of plates it was kind of fun to

288
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,209
go back and do this and then we kept

289
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,669
coming up with usual suspects based on

290
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,469
morphology so we would we would streak

291
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:02,689
them out onto minimal media to try to

292
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,339
make them saw relate and while we were

293
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,560
do while we were doing that we would

294
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:11,600
sequence the IDS regime of different

295
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:13,338
moral types we did about 384 individual

296
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,430
i TS sequencing to come up with these

297
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:19,850
eleven taxa which were sort of the usual

298
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:24,439
suspects and this non sporulating one is

299
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,940
was some fungi we couldn't get to spoil

300
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,420
eight it would just grow on this minimal

301
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:34,430
media and and we just we're trying to

302
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:36,860
figure out what it is actually so so

303
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:42,519
here's a here's the results what we have

304
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:47,110
here is corn on the top row here

305
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:51,799
2013-2014 soy on the bottom row

306
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:55,039
2013-2014 where you see an s that means

307
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,629
that the sorry let me step back and then

308
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,588
this is comparing the blue is the

309
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:02,570
isoline that's right Blue is isoline the

310
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:04,699
gray is the Roundup Ready genotype

311
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,579
without spray and the Green is the

312
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:08,719
Roundup Ready genotype with spray where

313
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:11,359
you see an S

314
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,778
that means the spray was significant so

315
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,199
it was a significant increase here when

316
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:20,659
we sprayed if you see a RR that means

317
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:24,349
that the gene had an effect in this case

318
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:27,649
it we it went down this is fairly

319
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,319
significant where you see a C that means

320
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,179
it's comparison between the blue bar and

321
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:34,269
the green bar that means the combination

322
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,979
of the spray and the genotype is

323
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:40,939
significant

324
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:45,110
really what I see here is just messiness

325
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,120
and while we were doing this my my whole

326
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,370
crew is saying to me why why are we

327
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,029
doing this it's really hard to ID a few

328
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,320
Serie more macro Femina just from

329
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,899
morphology and we're going through and

330
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,850
and and doing hundreds and hundreds of

331
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,740
samples like this and and probably some

332
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,810
of the mess in here is miss I being

333
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,759
these very similar-looking fungi and I

334
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:06,409
said well what we're doing is we're

335
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,990
looking for that we're looking for this

336
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:10,759
response we're trying to see if when we

337
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,120
repeated their experiments if we see

338
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:19,429
this and and our data our data doesn't

339
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:23,600
support this basically we see see some

340
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:26,359
random are not random but inconsistent

341
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,889
times when we saw a significant growth

342
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,350
and we would we described us as pretty

343
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,419
stochastic growth in in the sense of we

344
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,519
would see colonies here not not there

345
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:41,149
and we had lots of replicates to to try

346
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:47,329
to flesh this out so our data doesn't

347
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:50,449
support this exactly and we wanted to to

348
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,389
look at things in addition to just a few

349
00:16:50,450 --> 00:17:00,080
cerium so we ID'd of these all these

350
00:16:53,389 --> 00:17:01,340
other taxa and started looking started

351
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,240
looking at them from the standpoint of

352
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,140
okay well we have this consortium of

353
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,420
organisms here do we see any

354
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,310
relationship among the among the

355
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,560
organisms even if we're if it's not in

356
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,539
response to the treatments and then one

357
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,250
thing that popped out and this was very

358
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,559
clear looking at the plates is that

359
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,220
Fusarium and macro Femina seem to

360
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,079
co-occur together and the other thing is

361
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,470
that

362
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:30,169
trichoderma seemed antagonistic to

363
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,150
Fusarium and a few others but then in

364
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,600
some cases it it had a positive

365
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,670
correlation as well but in the organic

366
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,219
and no-till Trichoderma seem fairly

367
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,910
antagonistic to a number of different

368
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,910
organisms

369
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,160
so here's the here's a picture of

370
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:53,480
Fusarium tended to be positively

371
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,308
correlated with macro Femina Trichoderma

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,670
typical green spores looked like it was

373
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:07,710
antagonistic to a number of of different

374
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:10,410
taxa so if we so we moving on to the

375
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,410
sequencing part of this project we

376
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,929
wanted to use the same exact samples

377
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:21,360
that we used for the route culturing

378
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:23,759
work to then extract DNA from the

379
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:30,709
sequences in and DNA from the samples in

380
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:33,558
attempt to assemble a reflection of the

381
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,819
composition of the microbial community

382
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,859
so I'm gonna go through this and it's a

383
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,119
lot of words but but it might be very

384
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,619
important to some people in the audience

385
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:44,729
so I'll just go through this real quick

386
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:48,689
so we looked at we used my seat platform

387
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:52,558
and we looked at 1150 two separate

388
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,480
samples over 28 plates so we use full

389
00:18:52,558 --> 00:19:01,549
plates so that's that's that gives you

390
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:04,380
an idea of how deep we sequenced we used

391
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:06,269
we trim the ends using cut adapt some of

392
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,260
these are fairly new programs and data

393
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:12,299
to was used to filter the ends and infer

394
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,250
sequence variants so the reason I'm

395
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,319
pointing this out is we're not we're not

396
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,049
taking the sequences and trying to align

397
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,409
them to a big database and say what see

398
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:26,099
what species are these we're using

399
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:29,370
probability to say the this sequence

400
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:32,759
occurred so many times in my in my data

401
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:35,099
that it's probably real even if NCBI or

402
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,640
some database doesn't have a copy of

403
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:41,639
that and so we're determining sequence

404
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,220
variants by probability and not whether

405
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,960
it's been ID'd before or its similarity

406
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,569
to something that's been ID'd before and

407
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,090
I think that's that's that's kind of

408
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:53,069
where this field is going because we

409
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:55,500
realized we don't we haven't surveyed

410
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:57,389
everything yet and so it doesn't make

411
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,970
sense to throw out all that variation

412
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,650
and just keep finding ourselves in two

413
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:07,500
clusters or groups that have been

414
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:10,280
commonly identified we brought this data

415
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,490
into a file a seek and and created some

416
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:17,039
some tax on phylogenetic trees and then

417
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:23,579
use that information to create

418
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:26,220
ordinations within this dc2 program you

419
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,449
can you can run permanent OVAs and we

420
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,009
thought that was a very important thing

421
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,750
especially in a study like this where we

422
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:32,250
have multiple environmental factors and

423
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,750
we want to try to tease out which ones

424
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,549
are playing the most important role and

425
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,929
then we plotted this out ggplot and our

426
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:45,119
and and the and all of this work here we

427
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:48,450
host on a github github site so that

428
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,909
that's a public repository for for data

429
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,549
data analysis and we basically put all

430
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,860
our scripts up there so when we publish

431
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:59,279
this you'll be able to go get our data

432
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:02,279
and our send our program and rerun

433
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,109
everything you you want to or tweak it

434
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,428
the way you think you might so it's very

435
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:11,668
very much will be publicly available

436
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:17,940
okay so looking at this the sequence

437
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:20,100
data here is a rarefaction curve of all

438
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,289
of the wells and this is just to give

439
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:27,299
you idea of the variance among all the

440
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:27,928
whole experiment we sequence three

441
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,789
hundred paired

442
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:35,220
three hundred base prepared in fragments

443
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:41,879
and generated about 129 million reads

444
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:47,009
with a read count of a hundred and

445
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,650
twelve per sample we identified between

446
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:52,109
now this is this is actually calling go

447
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,860
to use but we identified between 800 and

448
00:21:52,109 --> 00:22:01,349
680 use in here when when you look at

449
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:02,189
the the rarefaction measure based on the

450
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,990
system's

451
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:12,600
there's no significant difference among

452
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:14,429
among the systems so this is a everyone

453
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,019
or not everyone but a lot of people have

454
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:18,900
seen these recently there's a

455
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:25,619
distribution of the dominant fungal tax

456
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,820
in the farming systems project and see

457
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,548
conventional tale

458
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:31,259
no-till organic three and organic six so

459
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:35,158
if you look at it right off the bat you

460
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:38,190
see well they I actually I won't tell

461
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,950
you what I think of these but uh you can

462
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,019
see differences here between in the

463
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,350
organic systems there's some differences

464
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:49,019
here there's there's some things that

465
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:52,019
stand out really clearly like this is

466
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:54,089
present in the no-till and N and not as

467
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:57,269
much in the others and then this one in

468
00:22:54,089 --> 00:23:01,859
particular is president organic three

469
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:04,769
and is just in organic so what are these

470
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:06,750
this is a abba city of my seats a little

471
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:11,669
puffball these are these are all

472
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:15,089
saprophytic organisms this this

473
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:17,220
particular organism produces a lot of

474
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:23,339
phenol oxidases and actually produces

475
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:25,169
lipases this piezo Sally's you've

476
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,819
probably seen these out in the field if

477
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:30,059
you work if you ever work out in the

478
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:32,909
field in corn or soybean field this we

479
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:36,869
all we've really only saw orphan

480
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,519
mainly in the organic systems I think

481
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:41,399
this is I think I think this is

482
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,210
interesting that that there are that

483
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,800
there are organisms that seem sort of

484
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,200
dominant in organic systems as opposed

485
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,059
to conventional systems these these

486
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,740
systems receive poultry litter there are

487
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:56,069
different inputs so it's very hard to

488
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,200
sort of just sect out exactly what could

489
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:01,919
be influencing these but we're we're

490
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:07,529
gonna follow up on this and then here

491
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:09,120
this this s cotija is a leaf is a leaf

492
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:12,680
lesion and what's very what's

493
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:15,989
interesting about this is it seems to

494
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,890
come on late in the season so no one

495
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,380
really focuses on it as a pathogen but

496
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:26,090
you can see it all over that's a bean

497
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,230
plant and it infects wheat as well and

498
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,740
people have thought that it really

499
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,420
doesn't do much because it comes on

500
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,529
right towards the ends of end of seed

501
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,690
fill but I wonder though if if some

502
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:41,039
organisms that we see appear late in the

503
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,279
season like that are not actually

504
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,849
Leighton organisms that are impacting

505
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:52,259
the the growth of these of these crops

506
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:58,889
and may be more highly abundant in some

507
00:24:52,259 --> 00:25:00,359
systems rather than others so if we want

508
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:05,150
to look at the structure of the fungal

509
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:08,399
community generally what we'll do is is

510
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,470
develop distance matrices and in this

511
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,230
case we've done that and plotted them

512
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,950
using n DMS

513
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:20,210
with a transform time step and so this

514
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:25,590
looks pretty confusing right and when I

515
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:29,548
but if you look here you have date 2014

516
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:31,048
is triangle 2013 is a circle and the

517
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:35,759
different systems are the different

518
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:41,009
colors I think you can see that the

519
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:45,119
no-till is here CT we've got org six

520
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:48,388
here and and they org three over here in

521
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,459
general the circles and it's it's a

522
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:52,589
little clearer in corn than in and in

523
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:57,329
soybean but the circles are on the lower

524
00:25:52,589 --> 00:26:01,558
part and the triangles are up further in

525
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:04,500
the graph above zero axis now what we

526
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:07,700
tried to do here was because we observe

527
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,710
just looking at sheer fungal counts on

528
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:13,319
plates we knew that there were major

529
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,130
differences between years we know that

530
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:20,308
there were differences in temperature

531
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:24,570
not only the the mean temperature but

532
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:27,658
the timing or the the pure easa T of the

533
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:30,269
temperature but also water right so what

534
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:32,370
we tried to do here was create a

535
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:35,490
covariance matrix that we could

536
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:38,668
transform the data with to account for

537
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:42,630
the time factor since we knew it was a

538
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:45,360
factor I don't know if I don't think it

539
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:49,429
worked really I mean it worked okay but

540
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:52,798
but there's better ways to do that and

541
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:56,610
this there's a new implementation of

542
00:26:52,798 --> 00:27:00,168
time to which explicitly addresses this

543
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:03,629
so time series and repeated measures and

544
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:05,340
and so Gregg Capra so who wrote this

545
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,169
program's come is gonna come to my lab

546
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,648
next week and we're gonna work on this

547
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:13,340
because in he's doing this right now in

548
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:16,408
human microbiome systems where you have

549
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,939
many individuals who all start off with

550
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,278
a different microbiome and you give them

551
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,899
a treatment and they all move like the

552
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,179
microbiomes move but they're not all

553
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:26,699
sort of coalescing as a single one and

554
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:28,950
so that's where that this the knee

555
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,470
for doing this came from but I think in

556
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,450
Ag science we have a real need for this

557
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,620
as well so hopefully in the next few

558
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,940
weeks we'll be able to create a

559
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:41,429
covariance structure that we can use to

560
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,700
control for the things that we know have

561
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:47,670
changed especially over times of time

562
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,539
and weather so if we just look straight

563
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:53,640
at abundances and and and code this this

564
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:56,579
data differently we actually doing it

565
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,800
differently with the PCA analysis so

566
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:00,029
where we don't we had to use n MVS

567
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,829
because of the way we did the

568
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:04,309
transformation of the data but this is

569
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:06,179
just a break artist distance matrix

570
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:11,129
represented in PCA

571
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:16,110
PCA and and the difference is here we

572
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:21,000
have spray and no spray so the CT spray

573
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:23,250
and no spray is here nt spray and no

574
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,569
sprays here and spray knows we're kind

575
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:30,119
of all jumbled on top of each other here

576
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:32,609
the organic six here again spray no

577
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,819
spray jumbled on top of each other and

578
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:37,949
here's the organic three over there when

579
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:43,980
I saw this I was very excited because I

580
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:46,890
thought wow that's really great after 26

581
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,400
years of management of these systems we

582
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,150
could see really clear like distinct

583
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,180
microbial communities that have been

584
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,430
that have developed over our consistent

585
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,640
differential management of these systems

586
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,640
I

587
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:01,570
oh I generally don't like drawing

588
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:03,668
circles around things because I'm like

589
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:05,439
hey what does that mean but we have

590
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:08,049
statistics to back that up so that's why

591
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,548
that's why I did this so pretty clear

592
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:15,788
that we have distinction among among the

593
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:21,429
systems but no clear distinction among

594
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:23,528
whether spray has an effect this D and I

595
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:26,288
look at these a lot but I don't know if

596
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:32,409
you see but time if we coated this by

597
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:34,749
time you'd see 2013 and 2014 2013 2014

598
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:38,830
so you can kind of see that differential

599
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:41,108
in there and so hopefully when we apply

600
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:44,798
better statistics to this will maybe be

601
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:46,358
able to consolidate those those data

602
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:47,918
clouds a little bit better and and have

603
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:50,678
a better understanding of how each

604
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,159
individual plot or each individual plant

605
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,309
yeah

606
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,970
changes when we applied glyphosate so I

607
00:29:54,308 --> 00:30:05,168
feel like we're we're not drilling in

608
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:09,879
well enough here so we we did per manova

609
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:14,349
I like I like using permit over for the

610
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:17,168
sort of complex models like this the soy

611
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:19,210
is on top and the corn is on the bottom

612
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:21,940
and really the take-home message is that

613
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,629
the system is significant and the year

614
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,340
is significant the sampling date meaning

615
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:30,398
before spray or after spray is

616
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:32,769
significant and I'm not sure how much

617
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:38,798
faith I put in this interaction term

618
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:43,839
here this is pretty consistent among

619
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:46,479
crops and this data is is I mean these

620
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,488
same exact factors are what we see when

621
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:54,038
we look at our other locations which

622
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:56,798
were in Mississippi and Illinois my what

623
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:59,079
my graduate student sent me of the

624
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,679
permit over for the bacterial stuff this

625
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:05,199
morning and and he's showing some some

626
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,729
of the same results but some things are

627
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,889
different and it might be that the

628
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:12,038
bacteria are actually responding more to

629
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:13,599
too

630
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:18,028
both system and glyphosate application

631
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:20,858
but that will be some other another talk

632
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:22,989
okay so what can we do what can we do

633
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:28,178
with this data we could so this is the

634
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:29,950
change in abundance of the made the

635
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,139
major tax of the change in abundance in

636
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:35,830
response to glyphosate application so

637
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:40,418
what you see here are a wide variety of

638
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:47,108
organisms that both increase increase or

639
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:53,528
decrease in relation to spray so the

640
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:56,648
weekend night we can place organisms on

641
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:59,259
this plot that are identified down to

642
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:01,618
the genus level because we use that

643
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:05,499
variant calling approach where we're not

644
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:08,528
relegated to picking a particular OTU

645
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:13,778
name from from a database and so in the

646
00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:18,339
case of you know we have Fusarium this

647
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:21,489
is a species of Fusarium that that

648
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:24,848
increased and we also see some Fusarium

649
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:29,079
that decrease and so really what what

650
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:31,618
we're seeing is no general response to

651
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:35,348
glyphosate application but most likely

652
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:36,908
if these are actually responding to the

653
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:39,668
glyphosate that there's differential

654
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:41,289
response and there's some other evidence

655
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:43,659
in the literature that that may actually

656
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:45,519
be the case that you might have bacteria

657
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:48,879
and fungi that are resistant or not

658
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,450
resistant based on the sensitivity of

659
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:58,689
that of that gene in those Shakima

660
00:32:52,450 --> 00:33:00,308
Cassatt pathway so conclusions there no

661
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,919
clear positive or negative impacts of

662
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:05,729
five-state application and the presence

663
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,739
of the Roundup Ready gene on the

664
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:11,229
likelihood of Fusarium being being

665
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:12,759
present in the corn was not was not

666
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:15,038
clear either it really looks like

667
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:18,519
there's there's not a strong impact of

668
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:24,049
that the culturing data suggests that

669
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:26,269
some organisms may Co occur as such

670
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:33,319
is she serious macro Femina and some may

671
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:34,670
be antagonistic like Fusarium so the

672
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,259
sequencing data suggests that the

673
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,600
overall fungal diversity among the

674
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:41,660
systems is not significantly different

675
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:44,899
but the structure of the community is

676
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,740
different so there's the the overall

677
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,180
diversity is not is not different and

678
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,740
with the with the tools that we're using

679
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:56,960
right now we can't discern whether

680
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,509
there's an effect of glyphosate but

681
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,230
these results suggest to the best of

682
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:06,950
that weekend that there is no effect of

683
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:08,000
glyphosate on the microbial community so

684
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,369
we're going to be working on the

685
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,739
repeated measures to refine this

686
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:17,630
analysis so where do we go from here

687
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:20,989
let's see let's see so Detrick is

688
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,700
working on network analysis and this

689
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:27,949
isn't it this is an example from this

690
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:29,750
paper Detrick actually has has a paper

691
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:32,859
out in which he did this type of network

692
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:37,039
analysis with on a on a different study

693
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,110
but he is he's going to apply these two

694
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,239
different types of network analysis like

695
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,929
a glow a global analysis which would

696
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:48,229
take into consideration all of the

697
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,880
interactions between the organisms that

698
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,840
are identified in any particular sample

699
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,190
and we could imagine this as we may see

700
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,920
networks that break out into nodes that

701
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:01,280
are that are representative of either

702
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,559
crops or systems we're not sure how

703
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,970
that's gonna gonna look right now but we

704
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,400
would we would imagine it would be

705
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,679
something sort of disjointed like this

706
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,530
the other type of network analysis which

707
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,319
we want to look into is this pair wised

708
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:18,500
pairwise analysis where you create

709
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,160
minimal networks that then have very

710
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,409
specific rules for how o to use or

711
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,839
organisms fit into the network so in

712
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:29,389
this in this case here and this gets at

713
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,550
this ho occurrence question this is a

714
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:34,369
this is a an example of where there's a

715
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:37,580
rule if there's a bacteria yeah and in a

716
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:40,429
in a Pseudomonas they

717
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:42,920
this flavor bacterium will be present so

718
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:46,069
basically it's saying out of all the

719
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,960
data you know if there's these two

720
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,539
organisms this other organism is always

721
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,059
going to be present and we want to do we

722
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:57,469
want to look specifically at some of

723
00:35:53,059 --> 00:36:00,739
those questions too to get at potential

724
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:02,889
antagonists for crop diseases and we

725
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:07,489
think we may be able to pick them out of

726
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:09,379
datasets like this and the fact that we

727
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:11,299
have a culturing project that goes right

728
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,400
along with this we have all the isolates

729
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,170
in hand so once we get the genotypes we

730
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,680
could go back and screen the actual

731
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:20,780
organisms so we've done a little bit of

732
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:22,879
this already this is my postdoc Brian

733
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,940
Keppler we actually started this project

734
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,260
after we started doing the sampling on

735
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,510
the main project but we finished this

736
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,900
beforehand and this is where we said

737
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:36,650
okay now if we have organisms that are

738
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:38,059
like varying their response to our

739
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,210
management some are going up some are

740
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:43,429
going down maybe we can get a handle on

741
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,530
how these cropping systems are affecting

742
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:47,659
these organisms by sort of drilling in

743
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:50,360
to one organism where we know a lot more

744
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:53,629
about the genetic diversity so in this

745
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,570
case we're interested in this organism

746
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:58,940
mehta rhythm which is an anthem of

747
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,980
pathogenic fungi and we're particularly

748
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,409
interested in it because it kills bugs

749
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,869
and we've been working with it a little

750
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:08,750
bit as a bio control for organic systems

751
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:13,909
looks kind of like Trichoderma in that

752
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:16,579
case and so what what Ryan did was he

753
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:19,789
targeted nine low-side that are involved

754
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:23,989
in meta regime mating type and we went

755
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:26,750
in and out of out of these these soils

756
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:31,669
that were collected from the from the

757
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:35,260
field went in and cloned bar-coded

758
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,840
indexed and sequenced these nine

759
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:41,030
different different low-side and what we

760
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,769
were able to do from that was determined

761
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,610
that there were that there were two

762
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:49,550
major clades of matter is 'i'm riper

763
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:51,559
roberta STI present so we have we

764
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:54,949
identified two major clades

765
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:57,079
what we have here is is this is the same

766
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:01,119
data it's just coded differently

767
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:04,789
this is clade one and this is clade -

768
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,249
this is a minimal spanning Network for

769
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:09,859
unique micro satellites so what this

770
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:11,899
what this is is these ot use are always

771
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:14,088
associated with these the thicker the

772
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,180
line the stronger the Association and

773
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:18,650
the thinner the line the weaker the

774
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:22,548
Association there's there's actually

775
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:24,349
tiny spotted line there and what we're

776
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:27,438
looking at in the top half of this what

777
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:31,309
we're looking at is the the size of the

778
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:36,009
node is how many ot use we collected

779
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:39,229
that that fall into that that node and

780
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:43,188
so it's the actual abundance and then

781
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:46,009
the the pie chart in there is how those

782
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:49,009
OTS were distributed among soybean corn

783
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:54,199
or alfalfa and so what you can see is

784
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:56,599
that clade 1 and clade to respond very

785
00:38:54,199 --> 00:39:01,219
differently to the different to these

786
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:04,309
different crops so or somewhat

787
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:07,369
differently there's there's some that

788
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:09,589
that are some bow to use that are

789
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:14,179
dominated by a corn some that are

790
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:16,248
dominated by soybean if we look on the

791
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:18,439
lower half we're looking at those at the

792
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:21,649
system and there you can see differences

793
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:25,578
as well so in in this in this case some

794
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:29,499
the these ot use are are in this case

795
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:33,048
preferentially found in organic six and

796
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:36,159
here they're evenly distributed so what

797
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:39,199
this is telling us is that even within I

798
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,239
mean this if we sequence the I TS of

799
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,358
this that iridium it would tell us it's

800
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,880
the same exact organism yet at a much

801
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:49,759
finer scale we can see that that

802
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,048
different mating types of this single

803
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:57,608
organism are responding differently to

804
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:57,608
both the system and the crop

805
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,549
so overall I would say that our farming

806
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,829
state our you know a farming systems

807
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:09,789
management it does influence microbial

808
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:12,300
community structure and and in some

809
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:16,808
cases our broad ways of identifying

810
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:21,150
these organisms may be like clouding our

811
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:23,980
ability to really look at the fine the

812
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:26,500
fine tuned effects of our management

813
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,900
decisions and I think ultimately you

814
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,199
know our goal isn't to be able to

815
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,750
identify an organism the the reason we

816
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:38,199
want to do that is so we can monitor

817
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:41,739
these organisms so we can see how when

818
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,629
we make decisions in the field when we

819
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,068
when we make a decision that's going to

820
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,930
be a long-term decision for how we

821
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:50,920
manage this field we want to be able to

822
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:52,899
monitor these organisms closely enough

823
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,750
so we can see if they are being affected

824
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,519
if they're resilient to change if they

825
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,298
are functioning the way we want them to

826
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,400
so in the end we're really trying to

827
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:05,530
design tools that allow us to assess the

828
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,460
the agro-ecosystem

829
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:12,040
and make recommendations that that

830
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,818
provide resilience and sustainability of

831
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:18,789
the long term so with that that this is

832
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:19,389
a team of folks that helped in this

833
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:20,889
project

834
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:23,259
Stephanie r-word from University of

835
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:26,429
Maryland graduate students and postdocs

836
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:32,850
and then a bunch of folks from USDA in

837
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:38,849
Beltsville yeah that's it

838
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:38,849
[Applause]

839
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:49,519
you continue to do this I'm thinking of

840
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:51,739
long-term experiments people don't even

841
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,530
if I round up for one year or two years

842
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:58,149
we keep doing it over decades right yeah

843
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,150
there's anyone looking into long-term

844
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:07,130
yes well one of the things we tried to

845
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:09,169
do here was to compare fields like the

846
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,970
organic fields had never had quite to

847
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,639
say before and I didn't really get into

848
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:15,829
this that much but the organic fields

849
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:17,900
never had life never had never seemed

850
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:20,329
like to say and the conventional fields

851
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,920
had seemed glyphosate for 20-something

852
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:26,599
years so it's so in terms of

853
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,550
experimental design we were kind of

854
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,019
stepping back in history and saying okay

855
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,420
here are these examples they're already

856
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:36,259
set can we start to determine

857
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:39,400
differences between them in our other

858
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:42,340
locations we had fields that had been in

859
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,300
undergunned er management glyphosate for

860
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,300
15 years or so and

861
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,889
fields that were just transitioned out

862
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:51,579
of like hey those are those are very

863
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:53,559
very different

864
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:55,719
it's it's very hard to set up an

865
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,730
experiment like that but it but you

866
00:42:55,719 --> 00:43:00,519
might have to look at systems that are

867
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:05,199
already existing you know to get those

868
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:06,789
learnt long-term effects but glyphosate

869
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,789
has been around since the 70s

870
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:12,279
so there's I'm sure there's examples of

871
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:15,250
this I think Cornell has examples of

872
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:18,330
long term with and without glyphosate

873
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,329
application I'm not sure

874
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,548
thanks for the patience I'm really

875
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:30,440
excited to see what your soil that music

876
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:33,559
because your expression is actually a

877
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,730
perfect design words idea that we

878
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:42,500
continuous 20 years of like station

879
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:44,389
versus not what would be isn't it

880
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,369
possible that you have a mishmash all

881
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:51,699
bacteria in life is a resistance

882
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:54,410
initially it being a whole lot of GMO

883
00:43:51,699 --> 00:44:04,598
that had that trade it was initially

884
00:43:54,409 --> 00:44:08,659
isolated yes yeah and then submitted for

885
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:22,519
pretty good old yeah look for the

886
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:24,500
resistance and I maybe look to see right

887
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:26,088
right so we're thinking we're thinking

888
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,579
about that and we went into this so I

889
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:32,139
have a whole another presentation on the

890
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:34,730
nitrogen fixation with in the soybean

891
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:37,519
groups and if you saw in the micro plot

892
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:40,280
map there were some micro plots I didn't

893
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,170
talk about that said nan Naja lating and

894
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,700
there so we had a whole nother

895
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,980
complement to this experiment and

896
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:47,838
instead of doing the meta to note we're

897
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,150
doing that some of that but what we did

898
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,190
was we isolated the rhizobia from the

899
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:55,670
nodules of the sprayed and non sprayed

900
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:59,358
round of ready plants and the and the

901
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:02,780
isoline plants and we're planning on

902
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:05,058
look in doing specific PCR basically to

903
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,010
to sequence those genes from the

904
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:08,930
different isolates to look for the

905
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:11,150
resistant and the non-resistant one and

906
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:14,269
we would basically do correlation

907
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:16,579
analysis there but the I think the

908
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:18,108
metagenomic analysis might I mean that

909
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:19,730
would be great and a lot of information

910
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:22,548
it might be overkill to get at that one

911
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,260
question and very expensive you know for

912
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:26,838
the amount of samples that we had so

913
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,630
we're thinking of getting isolates like

914
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:33,529
some thousand isolates or something like

915
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:38,119
that and just starts sequencing

916
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:41,420
the the the peru vape phosphate synthase

917
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:45,969
gene you know probably yeah so yeah I'm

918
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,970
thinking along the same lines but yes

919
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:51,500
it's not directly something you talk

920
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,880
about in your pot but I'm just curious

921
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,460
because you'd probably know better than

922
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,380
anybody the answers so with anything

923
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,449
that dose makes the poison right and

924
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,220
when we spray glyphosate onto plants

925
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:03,829
it has surfactants in it and thing or

926
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:05,539
things that make it stick to lead we

927
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:07,069
spray it right on the leaf we make sure

928
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:10,550
it sticks on the leaves so it kills

929
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:12,289
those things or not but it's not getting

930
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,690
taken up through the soil so is there

931
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:16,400
data on what is it the actual

932
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,019
concentration of glyphosate in the soil

933
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,579
even at the time of application let

934
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:22,309
alone like a week later Dewey's there

935
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:24,769
yeah and then for what period of the

936
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:26,420
year we do have a concentration of

937
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:28,190
legislating the soil that would because

938
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,389
this is a competitive inhibitor so it

939
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,610
needs to be at a high enough

940
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:33,049
concentration to have effect so for what

941
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,490
period of the year would it it receive

942
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,500
the concentration that the bacteria

943
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:41,419
would even see it yeah right

944
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:46,010
so there is data on the excitation rate

945
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:48,139
and we specifically did there was I to

946
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,700
call it like the indirect effects of

947
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,230
glyphosate application because you're

948
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:53,089
applying it to the plant and you're

949
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:55,639
affecting the microbes and that's like I

950
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:57,200
think a neat aspect of this in just in

951
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:58,639
general that it's all of this any

952
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,199
treatment effect is transmitted through

953
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,199
a plant xylem

954
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:08,719
there's information on it plants leak a

955
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:12,920
lot of glyphosate the surfactants stay

956
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:16,329
or some of them stay and I forget what

957
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,599
the exact number was but it was it was

958
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:24,319
it was in the tens percent of the actual

959
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:26,420
applied concentration and and it does

960
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,730
stay in the rhizosphere and that paper

961
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,260
like there's a paper I can give you the

962
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,059
reference later but the one of the

963
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,160
papers well it's all reported so you can

964
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:36,429
see one of the papers that I put up here

965
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,379
that talked about the stoichiometry of

966
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:43,879
glyphosate addresses that issue and

967
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:45,320
specifically specifically how much of

968
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,789
the product gets transformed into

969
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,769
breakdown products because that's

970
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:51,320
another issue because not only is

971
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:54,710
glyphosate a poison but it's breakdown

972
00:47:51,320 --> 00:48:00,170
product that is created in the plan as

973
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:03,909
as a way of detoxifying it is itself a

974
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:12,170
toxin but interestingly enough more to

975
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:15,649
unicellular yes for breakdown product

976
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,180
and um but but yeah that's a that's a

977
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,730
very interesting question because it is

978
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:23,059
like a it's a pulse and a select

979
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:25,789
selection that will then fade and the

980
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:28,190
half-life of glyphosate the molecule

981
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:30,590
itself is like under two weeks I think

982
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,210
in the in the soil itself unless it's

983
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,370
mixed with something then you have a

984
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:35,449
whole different thing but it's if I mean

985
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,059
if you look at it looks like great

986
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,349
microbial right so it doesn't when

987
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,090
they've done labeling studies it doesn't

988
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,909
stick allow around for a long time but

989
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:45,710
you do get that pulse so the susceptible

990
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:58,819
bacteria probably succumbing to it at

991
00:48:45,710 --> 00:49:02,210
least in short apology research on this

992
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:05,900
are a lot of ibuprofen pathogens are

993
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:09,920
actually the application it increases

994
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:13,869
resistance plant from a boring business

995
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,789
but further out from some of the faculty

996
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:17,089
sacrifice you mentioned it increases

997
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:19,250
there

998
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:22,190
there's actually more disease so it

999
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:24,980
depends on the lifestyle of fungus as

1000
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:29,420
well is that what that direction is we

1001
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:31,550
find the state but I was curious you

1002
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:35,059
start out your discussion about health

1003
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:38,060
yeah is there any intention to actually

1004
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:40,940
look at symptomology and both Fusarium

1005
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:42,289
and and macro Femina would lend

1006
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,900
themselves very well because they both

1007
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:47,719
cause very pronounced fruit ice in both

1008
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,430
the soybean and right and and so the

1009
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:51,409
numbers and things are great but it

1010
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:54,829
would be interesting to see are you

1011
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:56,659
getting more rude by creating rice so as

1012
00:49:54,829 --> 00:50:00,110
you probably know it's very difficult to

1013
00:49:56,659 --> 00:50:01,329
assess that and when it takes a lot of

1014
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:05,809
times yeah it's not difficult

1015
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:08,719
yeah but we we had a pathologist out in

1016
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:13,489
our fields and they were like there's

1017
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:16,039
not a lot here at all so so we generally

1018
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:20,659
don't have cheese areum and macro Femina

1019
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:30,199
as a problem in Maryland in a way I'm

1020
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:32,960
thinking maybe no on the other side of

1021
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:37,329
the farm is very sandy this section here

1022
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,329
is pretty clay actually there's a hold

1023
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:13,750
this has been a production of Cornell

1024
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:13,750
University on the web at Cornell edu
