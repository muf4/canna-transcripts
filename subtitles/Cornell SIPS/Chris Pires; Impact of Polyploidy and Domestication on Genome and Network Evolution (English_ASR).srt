1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,580
well thank you for the introduction

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,539
Margaret and Gaurav and other people who

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,300
invited me here can you hear me in the

6
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,678
back Jerry Davis is reminding me earlier

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,150
the last time I was here and in this

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,099
room was 2005

9
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,899
and I lost my voice and I whispered my

10
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:22,609
way through the entire presentation

11
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:26,118
apparently I thought we hopefully that

12
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:27,650
won't happen today so it since 2005 I've

13
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,829
been at the University of Missouri and

14
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:32,028
it took me probably 10 years to figure

15
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,768
out how to talk to people about my

16
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,650
research I used to tell people I worked

17
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:37,789
on heterosis and hybrid vigor and

18
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:40,189
chimeras and all these kind of things

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,228
but I finally learned if I really wanted

20
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:43,369
to talk to people out in the public it

21
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,478
was the best thing I could do is say I

22
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:46,518
worked on the dogs of the plant world

23
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:49,100
because I could tell them that you know

24
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:51,350
you know a chihuahua and a Great Dane or

25
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,939
a dog but did you know their broccoli

26
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,030
cauliflower kale Brussels sprouts or one

27
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:57,558
species like a dog and then we can spend

28
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,518
the rest of the time talking about their

29
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:04,039
dogs and I'm just a nice professor

30
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,900
talking about Docs so that's that's

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,939
that's what I've that's first knowledge

32
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,340
bomb of the day for people let's talk

33
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:11,929
about your dogs okay now if I get on an

34
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,000
airplane and I don't want to talk to

35
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,790
people I just tell people I'm an

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,849
evolutionary biologist and that pretty

37
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,950
much stops the conversation class now I

38
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:24,469
put on my headphones and start reviewing

39
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,900
name scripts so but I if I am thinking

40
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,870
about evolution I really start with Oh

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,850
No 1970 and before that because oh no

42
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,250
postulated that gene duplication played

43
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:36,140
a major role in evolution and so in the

44
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,599
era of genomics I think the big update

45
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,280
to this is what I'm just going to tell

46
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,408
you is the thesis of my talk today and

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,299
that's that all duplications aren't

48
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,890
alike so if you spend a lot of time like

49
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,719
I do working with computer scientists

50
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,239
you really have to get them to recognize

51
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,569
the difference between tandem duplicates

52
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,978
and polyploid duplicates because they

53
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:56,929
behave differently and they operate

54
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:59,420
differently in terms of systems and so

55
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,250
you have to do this lesson building the

56
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,650
second thing which is going to be the

57
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,349
theme of my talk is these whole genome

58
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,420
duplications occur throughout most of

59
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:10,429
life taxonomically and also over time

60
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,189
and so I'm going to talk today about

61
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,349
both recent and ancient polyploidy and

62
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,419
now that we no longer rely on reference

63
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,459
genomes but use pan genomes to

64
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,359
understand variation this structural

65
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,830
variation

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,540
super important so if you're doing jiwa

67
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,980
you can't just do it on snips you have

68
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,939
to include structural variants if you

69
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,949
really want to understand the

70
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,810
genotype-phenotype map and that's just

71
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:33,530
not for plants and crops but also for

72
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,879
human diseases and things like cancer so

73
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,620
this crowd doesn't need to know about

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,599
what is polyploidy cuz you guys all know

75
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,980
what poly puddi is but i do want to make

76
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,719
the distinction between auto and a low

77
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:44,000
poly hoody so if your historical

78
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,319
cytogeneticist like a stamp eloquent you

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,659
define Auto and a law based on

80
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,310
chromosome pairing whereas I'm going to

81
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,359
talk about it today in terms of ancestry

82
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,069
and what I'm going to talk about

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,480
specifically today is a low poly puddi

84
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,150
where you have the merger of two

85
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,399
distinct species that come together so

86
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,200
another way the cid state this is I

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,030
really like chimeric thinks hybrids and

88
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,159
I'll even say grafting for Margaret's

89
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,590
sake so bringing two things together

90
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,599
that normally don't belong and how does

91
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,560
how do you get novelty from the

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,989
combinations of new things so I would

93
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,539
say the major advance since I started

94
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,509
grad school in 1994 and finished in 2000

95
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,919
was knowing that from sided genetic

96
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:27,289
evidence things like corn were probably

97
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,469
paleo polyploids from from compared to

98
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:34,459
sorghum based on even basic observations

99
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:36,349
but the biggest surprise hands down from

100
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,489
the rabid offices genome paper wasn't

101
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,840
all the things that were promised when

102
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,840
they started the rapid offices genome

103
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,090
project it was this figure and the other

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,159
analyses that showed that this tiny

105
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,950
little genome with bio chromosomes had

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,650
not one not two but three polypoid

107
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,060
events which were named alpha beta and

108
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,739
gamma from the most recent to the

109
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,569
ancient and at that time people

110
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,519
speculated that alpha was about the base

111
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,069
of the mustard family beta was at the

112
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,469
base of the eudicots and gamma was at

113
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:06,049
the base of all angiosperms and all

114
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,280
three of those assertions were law which

115
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:12,349
became the basis of the first part of my

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,840
talk as we sequenced grape and Ambro and

117
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,579
other things at least when I started as

118
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,350
a grad student we would say things like

119
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,239
Oh 70% of flowering plants are probably

120
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,160
played well that was based on that idea

121
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,168
of thinking about what a neo polypoid is

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,390
and Stowe mates and things like that but

123
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:28,339
if you now look deep in time about how

124
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,259
you define how Hoodie we now know that

125
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,339
all flowering plants extend flowering

126
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,709
plants including umbrella

127
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,949
have an ancestor that was polyploid so

128
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,899
we

129
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,149
really shouldn't ask ourselves are you

130
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:40,819
polyploid we should really say when was

131
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,289
the last time you were polyploid and so

132
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,909
us who are burger breads well the last

133
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,950
time we were polyploid was about 350

134
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,810
million years ago right so we're all we

135
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,339
are polypoid right and people like ethan

136
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,350
mix light had made a career studying how

137
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:53,839
those polypoid duplicates left from the

138
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,030
origin of poly puddi from vertebrates

139
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,159
are now part of our disease network and

140
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,169
of course there's a whole groups of

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,820
invertebrates that are polyploid as well

142
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,840
as the most species groups of

143
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:07,250
vertebrates like fish and frogs so if

144
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,369
you're in one of the four groups of the

145
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,379
school that works with crop plants and

146
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,610
you care about domestication you should

147
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:18,079
also know by now that crop plants are

148
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,160
compared to the wild plants more likely

149
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,319
to be polyploid okay so one question is

150
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,660
how do genomes and all the other omics

151
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,550
and networks evolve and brassicas or any

152
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,570
crop based on this knowledge so the very

153
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,540
important points i'm going to talk about

154
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:37,670
today are brassicas so the dogs of the

155
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,080
plant world I call old oratio cabbage

156
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,210
broccoli cauliflower so forth

157
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,339
rascal Rapa maybe you don't know is also

158
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:44,899
a dog or cat because it has all these

159
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:47,899
amazing Chinese vegetables to things

160
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:49,489
like turnip and Brassica napus is also

161
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:51,259
pretty burst has underground things like

162
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,180
rutabagas or Swedes leafy things like

163
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:57,769
siberian kales and then a whole suite of

164
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,629
whale seeds but here's the here's the

165
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:02,479
real big picture of what my labs been

166
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,459
doing so my lab along with I would say

167
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,720
Doug and Pam Soltis lab and maybe Jeff

168
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:07,250
Doyle's lab a few others have been

169
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,470
looking at how I played not from recent

170
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,209
times but also at the base of families

171
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,390
and all the way back to the origin of

172
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:16,789
flowering plants and so what I'm showing

173
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,349
here is Brassica if you imagine was

174
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,340
don't know what so imagine that in the

175
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,439
mustard family you had an eight

176
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,359
chromosome ancestor over evolutionary

177
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,610
time Arabidopsis became diploid eyes to

178
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,400
five chromosomes and then some one time

179
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,350
around 15 million years ago there was a

180
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,509
hex hexaploid e so to two rounds of

181
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,160
polyploidy a hexaploid event so you went

182
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,680
from 8 to 24 chromosomes in the

183
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,510
brassicas and then those deploys deploy

184
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,819
did not diploid eyes down to 9

185
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,399
chromosomes in Olesya 10 chromosomes in

186
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,079
Rapa 2 to 4 million years ago and then

187
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,359
those merged together to make Brassica

188
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,300
napus an alle polyploid

189
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
and so this is neil pali puddi Brassica

190
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,199
napus

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,968
mismo polyploidy this kind of where you

192
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,949
can see chromosome segments and blocks

193
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:59,598
they're acting like diploid x' but you

194
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,610
can still see these blocks and then

195
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,740
paleo polyploidy the alpha beta gamma

196
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,330
again and a rabid abscess where you just

197
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,370
have duplicate genes left but no sense

198
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,899
to me really among them so I'm gonna

199
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,478
give my talk today talking about these

200
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:14,239
three polyploid eras if you will going

201
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,740
from oldest to most recent oh by the way

202
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,360
if you add up all the polypoid events

203
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,668
together from the origin of flowering

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,250
plants arab adopts this is 12 x the

205
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:24,889
diploid brassicas or 36 X and Brassica

206
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,589
napus is 76 72 X so we publish that

207
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,098
genome and science and 2014 was the most

208
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:32,299
polyploidy genome at the time okay how's

209
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:36,259
the four parts of my junk okay so

210
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,930
yesterday day before stay way here so

211
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,270
Fei Wei and I and 200 other people over

212
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,189
the last decade have thrown ik together

213
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:45,500
a thousand some odd transcriptomes

214
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:47,000
under the leadership of I would say

215
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,189
mostly Jim Liebman smack and some other

216
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,848
people and we spend a lot of time on

217
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,900
this project

218
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:53,088
kind of like the rabid Offices Genome

219
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,250
Project to make a big tree a big nuclear

220
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:56,718
gene tree of flowering plants to

221
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,610
contrast to the mostly chloroplasts

222
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:01,728
organelle a tree and we also wanted to

223
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,259
look at gene family expansion but what

224
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,519
was the big result it's like they're

225
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,020
revved offices genome result with its

226
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,128
three poly put events the big results of

227
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,829
this paper has nothing to do with a tree

228
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,528
you really has to do with this 244

229
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:14,778
ancient WG DS whole genome duplications

230
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:17,028
across green plants 65 the match

231
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:19,158
published genomes every Lane plant

232
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:21,348
lineage has an ancient polypoid event

233
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:25,699
except for some weird ones liverworts

234
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:27,560
and by contrast almost none of the

235
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,139
things in the water algal we need just

236
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,310
have evidence of polyploidy dad in my

237
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,719
mind is the big word so now you don't

238
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,519
have to read the paper just came out two

239
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,409
days ago you can go with that okay now I

240
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,810
want to read you the last two sentences

241
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:40,278
three sentences so here is gene and

242
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,569
genome duplications have been considered

243
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,820
a source of evolutionary oddity

244
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,500
however the direct connections between

245
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,360
key innovations the specific gene

246
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,190
duplications are rarely known due in

247
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,289
part to lag times between duplications

248
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,320
and such innovations so earlier today I

249
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:58,379
met with gowrav and we're gonna say we

250
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,520
he is going to explain this because this

251
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,009
at the genes and everything else

252
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,379
duplicate yeah enzymes don't change

253
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:06,240
right away right it takes some time time

254
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:07,559
to do stuff so if you look on a tree

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,180
where polypoid events occur there's

256
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,379
always a lag between when they actually

257
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,219
get novelty and when they actually

258
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,899
specie 8 so anyway we'll be talking

259
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,820
about this in the future so and then

260
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,679
what do they say next in this paper with

261
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,660
a week we need to do more experiments on

262
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,979
this so in my mind the way you do these

263
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:25,019
experiments are not just in one system

264
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,269
but across the clay that has polyploidy

265
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,389
be it grasses and your polka knee or

266
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:34,110
brass casing okay so starting with the

267
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:36,449
oldest polypoid events this this part of

268
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,820
this project was motivated by what's the

269
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:43,259
origin of mustards so you know when you

270
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,210
eat wasabi or mustard or radish maybe

271
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,009
spicy things they don't have those

272
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,570
flavors and tastes because they're good

273
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,360
for us just because they're good for the

274
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,610
plants all right it's keeping the way

275
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,960
critters well they keep away a lot of

276
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,909
critters but it occurs like these

277
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,650
butterflies along got eat them and so

278
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:03,719
then what happens caterpillar shows up

279
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:06,539
nom-nom-nom-nom heats the plants and the

280
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,920
plant goes help and then here comes some

281
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,329
little wasp or something else so you

282
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,529
have these tri trophic interactions and

283
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,660
there's microbes involved in everything

284
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:14,189
so I have this really cool evolutionary

285
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,799
relationship which this relationship

286
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,360
alone is how Eric and Raven coined the

287
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:23,250
term coevolution was thinking about this

288
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,659
model so because I told you earlier

289
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,009
about Alpha Beta Gamma people didn't

290
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,899
know where this beta gamma event were

291
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,879
they thought that the one was at the

292
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,309
origin of you dicots another one beta

293
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,720
event I was in a meeting in China and my

294
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,979
clothing was there and he said something

295
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,810
he probably should have know which was

296
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,940
Oh Andy Pettis and I'm just looking at

297
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:40,559
by genome and it doesn't have beta and

298
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,900
so Pat edger that's true in my time

299
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,929
who's now a professor at Michigan State

300
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,009
said we're gonna find beta so that's

301
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,599
what this project started was we're

302
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,460
gonna find beta and then we're gonna see

303
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,659
an alpha these two ancient polypoid

304
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,639
events in rabid offices and we're gonna

305
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,100
see how they affect gooks and network

306
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,299
and then Pat defended his PhD in 2012

307
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
and we're going to publish the paper

308
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,449
just on the plant side and at that time

309
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,509
Chris wheat was driving across Missouri

310
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,379
to go to Kansas to talk about the the

311
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:05,909
Lepidoptera butterfly part of the story

312
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,439
and we lined up these trees and it was

313
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:08,039
too good to be true so we got to publish

314
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,530
this paper together

315
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,759
so then this is the only time in my life

316
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,709
for us that oh 50

317
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,960
anniversary at Peter Raven and polar

318
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,670
eggs paper blah blah blah it's got to be

319
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,670
a nature paper no no nature paper

320
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:22,529
science paper no no science paper so we

321
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:25,349
finally published in PNAS and it's been

322
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:27,059
our biggest by far things so NPR

323
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,740
Washington Post writer New Zealand Daily

324
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,289
Mail but I was still not too happy about

325
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,940
the nature science thing until it was

326
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:35,429
the opening joke of a Big Bang Theory

327
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,150
episode and then I said screw you

328
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:40,529
science in nature I got a job I don't

329
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,459
need your stupid journals anyway and I'm

330
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:44,730
not I'm gonna try to submit there

331
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,840
anymore and so up for the deal I will

332
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,789
tell a brief version of the story

333
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,980
because I feel that many times before so

334
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:52,230
what happens right plants evolve a novel

335
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,990
biochemical defense the plants radiate

336
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,850
we showed that insects evolved a counter

337
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,500
adaptation the cool part of this story

338
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,029
the butterflies don't have polyploidy

339
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,840
but they have a tandem gene duplicate

340
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:02,279
that gives them basically the

341
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,950
countermeasure to the mustard oil bomb

342
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,259
so then the the butterflies diversify

343
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,090
and then so forth and so on and now the

344
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,409
butterflies of course are cued into they

345
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,120
did what is necessarily defense the

346
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,350
other plant

347
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,169
okay so the big result of this is shown

348
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,850
in this figure so this is a first thing

349
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:20,009
we did was we made of the first nuclear

350
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,720
gene based phylogeny the Brassica leaves

351
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,950
before was unresolved so we could

352
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,600
actually do what hadn't been done before

353
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,670
which is map all the glucosinolates on a

354
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,129
tree to infer the order that they

355
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:30,809
evolved the second thing was we showed

356
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:32,580
with a probably put events were based on

357
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,289
transcriptomes and shadow genome so

358
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,570
there's the Blue Diamond for beta and

359
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,649
that blue diamond for alpha so we showed

360
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,020
where those probably played events were

361
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:42,240
the third thing was we compared where

362
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,340
the polypoid events were relative to

363
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,830
species radiations those are where the

364
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,509
stars are so the brass at KC and those

365
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,830
top ones in green the three big specie

366
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,909
host families are totally different than

367
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,230
all those other families if you're

368
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:54,870
taking pine systematics you probably

369
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,340
don't learn nted to plan Tracy and

370
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,899
plants estimate well maybe you do here

371
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,019
but most places know there's only one

372
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,819
species so then the other thing was the

373
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,329
innovation of guca simulate classes that

374
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,770
correspond to these polypoid events so

375
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,790
there's the where the radiations occur

376
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:13,620
and so we identified that there's these

377
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:16,319
novel pathways and similar work has been

378
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,539
done in a Cell an AC by Rob blast and

379
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,340
other people so since then this work has

380
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:22,639
continued so we've been updating the

381
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,750
kind of phylogenetic framework for

382
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,649
drastic Haley's thinking particularly

383
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,960
about glucose in

384
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,909
and we just posted it on bio archive a

385
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,710
paper that will expire in two other

386
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,969
polypoid events such as within the Clio

387
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,920
Maisie and some of these other families

388
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:40,470
and next slide we now have this really

389
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,879
large three three CSP is with GGI to

390
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,350
look at note that she not just the

391
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,740
genomes but also the transcriptome a

392
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,860
metabolic metabolic profiling across

393
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:53,610
members of this group and so we have

394
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,310
massive convergent evolution of various

395
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,740
metabolic pathways polypoid events we

396
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:00,119
have in nineteen twenty new genomes to

397
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,210
add to ones that already out there

398
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,589
there's this huge team including Jacob

399
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,269
Washburn in this room and others who've

400
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,610
helped with this and these recent

401
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:10,980
projects are we're going to go deep into

402
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,990
the Brassica oleracea crammed hispanica

403
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,480
philosophy Arvin C which he may knows

404
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,700
pennycress camelina and a rabbit and

405
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,278
Arabidopsis to look at to do like

406
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,778
platinum on genomes for about ten to

407
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,629
twenty s sessions and to do a whole

408
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,759
bunch of tissue specific profiling of

409
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:29,250
transcriptomes and metabolisms to see

410
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,929
how those change those networks and Jen

411
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,080
Weiss caber and Pat edger and ganglia

412
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:36,088
Stein and I are leading that effort okay

413
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,790
so that's ancient polyploidy in a

414
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:41,250
nutshell so old duplicates really matter

415
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:44,519
for big novel key innovations that can

416
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,278
result in classic and clay defining

417
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,659
features so what about these polypoid

418
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,429
events which you can't see in our

419
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,528
microscope but if you paint a genome you

420
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,750
would see like oh for every back sized

421
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:57,088
piece in a rabid abscess I three sty see

422
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:00,809
three of those Nebraska rabba or brass

423
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,580
Koehler Asya okay so here's here's a

424
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,199
simple slide showing the diversity of

425
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,800
Brassica Rapa you have things like

426
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,240
turnip

427
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,669
we should probably familiar with if

428
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,049
you're in any Asian market or a farmers

429
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:11,610
market that has Chinese vegetables you

430
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:14,519
have Chinese cabbage and bok choy you

431
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,589
have sarsens or oil seeds which come in

432
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,819
yellow and brown colors you have some

433
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,220
other field mustards and you have this

434
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,520
interesting thing or rapini

435
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:25,170
so you have a second so when we started

436
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,699
this study and this was a collaboration

437
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,189
with Mike Gore and Joe and Labatt

438
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,900
started with first MGBs sequencing of

439
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,820
the USDA collection what do we know

440
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,860
about Brassica Rapa well there were two

441
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,300
studies that were out one was in 2011

442
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,820
about how they're basically some

443
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,029
morphological groups there was a study

444
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,040
in

445
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,959
2014 which said actually there's

446
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,169
Geographic groups because things like

447
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,300
turnips are found in in Asia and in

448
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:50,009
Europe and so turnip like things are

449
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,139
more closely related things that are

450
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,909
looked different and then from then they

451
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,990
did together and then while we were in

452
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:57,179
the middle of our study there was a

453
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,879
large paper by Chang and Alan both rabba

454
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:01,709
and other Asia which gave out this tree

455
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,059
but as you can see it's the groups are

456
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,940
what we found but it's pretty comb-like

457
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:08,219
and how things are related and so what

458
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,020
we were when I was can we tell where

459
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,560
things domesticated multiple times where

460
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,850
they move by people and so forth and

461
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,250
then the real question that was burning

462
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,889
for me and also for some other students

463
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,559
was what about these leafy things are

464
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:26,519
they wild are they domesticated or are

465
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:30,929
they feral and so in this first study we

466
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:33,090
had a lot of a sessions 333 and we found

467
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:35,279
these major groups so we bought Joy's a

468
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,230
group on the top Chinese cabbage and

469
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,059
they weren't formed by hybrids which

470
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,920
some people had hypothesized we found

471
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,259
Asian turnips and various other Asian

472
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,479
vegetables in purple the sarsens

473
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,769
formed one cluster so yellow and brown

474
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,940
stars and are really just one thing

475
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,100
they're just different by a gene or two

476
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,180
and then we found these turnips at the

477
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,950
base and also some groups that are named

478
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,929
taxonomically like field west mustards

479
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,610
or polyphyletic now the problem with

480
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,899
this study so this we're the first ones

481
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,480
to show this but the problem in this

482
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,240
study is we didn't sample rapini and a

483
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,950
bunch of other types and also there

484
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,349
weren't really any wild samples that

485
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,420
were put in this so then in a follow-up

486
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,219
study this was a collaboration with Mike

487
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,779
marker and Gavin Conant and I on a plan

488
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,460
genome gram we looked at the diversity

489
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,500
of Brassica Rapa using transcriptomics

490
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,660
so our lab is one de Labs along with

491
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,849
Claude two pamphlets Jim Lehman's Mac

492
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,560
and others who really got off to us

493
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,480
early start using transcriptome was both

494
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,149
for phylogenetics and population

495
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,069
genetics so this was looking at 126

496
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,320
sessions we again found these same

497
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:36,299
groups as I talked about before but we

498
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:41,279
did answer one question which was the

499
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:43,349
rapini x' rapini x' here were clearly

500
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,359
fully nested next to be sarsens so

501
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:47,459
they're not at the base of the tree so

502
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,829
that was like a big result from this

503
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,640
paper in terms of how the topology of

504
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:52,929
these groups looked the

505
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,640
we didn't sample Asian turnips and a

506
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,630
bunch of other things the other thing

507
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,160
that we did in this paper

508
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,930
was this was the first time that a

509
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,910
demographic bonded like Daddy had been

510
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,320
used so some people who worked on those

511
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,360
and humans helped us work on these in

512
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,119
these plants and the two postdocs

513
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,949
working in on this project since riichi

514
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,349
and Mike Parker's lab and home on in my

515
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,700
lab both were into reading about where

516
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,349
cabbages and things are were in the

517
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,049
Chinese literature and so they're able

518
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:18,759
to track that oh where we saw the origin

519
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,440
of turnip was where the conform tablets

520
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,450
had them on in Babylon and Iraq and

521
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,490
where they were in classic poetry in

522
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,080
China at 26 years hundred years ago or

523
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,220
thirteen hundred years ago or nine

524
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,259
hundred sixty years ago pretty much

525
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,480
mashed and very rough since when these

526
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:34,740
demographic models put the spread of

527
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,759
Brassica Rapa mostly from east to west

528
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,130
so it turns out of course that that

529
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,480
follows the Silk Road pretty nicely and

530
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,580
there's lots of admixture back and forth

531
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,250
and in contrast there was a bottleneck

532
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,629
that's origin of the sarsens and that

533
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,269
happened about the same time as when

534
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,610
Alexander the Great went into that part

535
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:54,009
of India so that sounds like it's a very

536
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:56,319
nice and neat story except for this guy

537
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:58,240
so this is Alex McHale be he was a grad

538
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,529
student at evince rulers

539
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,079
I think Geoff was that one of your

540
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:05,500
students so this is Geoff Doyle's

541
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,750
academic grandson he's now a postdoc

542
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,789
here with sunny powers I think and he's

543
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,509
he came he's been collecting a ton of

544
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,980
these around the world

545
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,920
he says that's a really simple story

546
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,630
there's actually 13 different subspecies

547
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,769
of Brassica Rapa few folks are missing

548
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,950
there's all these feral things all over

549
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,769
the world and actually we his hypothesis

550
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,539
is that Brassica Rapa originated

551
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,519
probably in the caucuses and spread east

552
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,680
and west and so anyway there's a lot

553
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,250
more to do with this it's not a done

554
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,560
story at all all right so back to the

555
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,180
network idea so with this kind of

556
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,579
population in the genetic framework of

557
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,700
how abrasca rap has evolved what about

558
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:44,829
these duplicate genes and so Mike Barker

559
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,569
and the consortium of us have a

560
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,429
manuscript that we're putting together

561
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:51,159
where basically we're looking at targets

562
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,930
of selection with the particular

563
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,930
comparison between duplicates that come

564
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:58,810
by tain them versus polyploid and so

565
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,580
looking at the paleo logs for these we

566
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,079
ask this question do paleo logs have a

567
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:04,299
higher genetic diversity than other

568
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,388
genes of Brassica Rapa and the answer

569
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:08,209
this is

570
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:10,908
yes there's a four-fold higher diversity

571
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:12,379
of these paleo logs so now we although I

572
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,969
really like to do is take these lists of

573
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,648
paleo logs and look at them not just a

574
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:19,249
Nebraska rabbit but also in Brasco

575
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:22,788
Laurasia kales or an arugula or other

576
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:27,409
other plants that are related to this

577
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:28,969
event so I like to think about my I like

578
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,169
to ask people not just what their

579
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,639
five-year plan is but if you could

580
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:32,778
summarize your research into one

581
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:35,178
question what would it be

582
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:37,368
so this I don't have a one-word answer

583
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,719
but I have this picture so in my mind

584
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:40,608
I'm really interested in how networks

585
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:42,859
evolve over time and what happens when

586
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:45,558
you're a chimera so if you imagine any

587
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:47,358
network on the left side after a whole

588
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,969
genome duplication we have this plethora

589
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:53,388
of possibilities and over time you have

590
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:55,788
mostly GMOs but you can have novelty by

591
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:58,758
having new topologies of relationships

592
00:20:55,788 --> 00:21:00,798
which is indicated by that arrow and red

593
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,858
and my thought partners in this over the

594
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,989
years have been Jim birch there Gavin

595
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:07,788
Conant Mike Freeling and others to think

596
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:09,649
about well if you wanted to understand

597
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:12,288
human medicine wouldn't be cool yet a

598
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:13,518
polyploid human right so if you want

599
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:15,048
understand a plant wouldn't be cool if

600
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,489
you had a polyploid plant oh my gosh we

601
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:18,288
had probably played plants so when you

602
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:19,999
double the system can you really look at

603
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:22,098
the constraints of network evolution and

604
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:25,669
what the consequences are for phenotype

605
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:28,538
crops synthetic biology and so Gavin and

606
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:31,999
Jim and I wrote a paper in 2014 on this

607
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:34,398
Jacob Washburn and Kevin Bird and Gavin

608
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,558
I wrote a paper in 2016 on convergence

609
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:39,138
and multiplies it's about convergence

610
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,378
and we published a paper in 2018 our

611
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:44,508
biology know makes and Network evolution

612
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:46,069
that is we spend a lot of time on and

613
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:48,169
then gal Rob and I on a Gugu best

614
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:49,489
published a paper recently on I'm

615
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:52,369
thinking about this in terms of

616
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:54,729
metabolism so if you want our

617
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:58,728
philosophical thoughts there they are

618
00:21:54,729 --> 00:22:00,979
all right so back to experiments so this

619
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:04,159
is a unpublished experiment on Brassica

620
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:05,389
Rapa a rabbit offices and cleome and we

621
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,919
would have published it a long time ago

622
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:08,418
except the Brassica Rapa genome that we

623
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,690
used for it is still sitting and

624
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:13,429
published and a nun named groups

625
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,200
basement so I'll show you the results

626
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,909
and it will just repeat it someday so

627
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,830
the experiment was this was if you look

628
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:20,620
at a rabbit opposites abrasca across

629
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:22,639
tissues and across a bunch of different

630
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,459
challenging treatments over circadian

631
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,970
time course what do you see

632
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:33,528
so we using whites dark flooding salt

633
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,569
cold and methyl Jasmine aid so imagine

634
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:37,130
in a broad scheme you have whatever Arab

635
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:37,548
adopts this network that you want to put

636
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,480
together

637
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:42,798
Rask is gonna have three sub networks

638
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,500
from write the whole genome trip

639
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,179
locations X hexaploid E and over time

640
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,369
one of those sub genomes

641
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,288
LF these fraction unity still resembles

642
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,119
the ancestral Arabidopsis genome pretty

643
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:56,658
much where's the other two sub genomes

644
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,879
have have become highly fractionated so

645
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:01,340
if you look at the genome a Brassica

646
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,110
Rapa only seven percent of it is still

647
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,000
in triple kid thirty-two percent of it

648
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:06,918
is in duplicate and sixty-one percent of

649
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,220
it is single copy so now let's look at

650
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,559
some abiotic stresses only a fraction of

651
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,690
the duplicates are expressed in any

652
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,658
particular stress whether it's hypoxia

653
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,679
salt cold or methyl jasmine 8 but what

654
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,470
I'll show you is that they're different

655
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,509
duplicates in different situations so no

656
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,159
Rabbid OPS's if your entire interactome

657
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:28,339
is ten thousand eight hundred and eleven

658
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,470
nodes in a rabid OPS's this abiotic

659
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:33,949
stress node is about nine hundred sixty

660
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:35,720
one and in Brassica okay and then in

661
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,490
Rabbid offices by the way that stress

662
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,889
network two hundred thirty eight nodes

663
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,099
so 25% of those nodes go off and

664
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:45,500
everybody get stressed in Brassica you

665
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:52,428
have many more nodes from the sub

666
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:55,759
genomes 537 289 239 but only 2% only 2%

667
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,929
of those responds in all conditions so I

668
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,278
was explaining this to some non

669
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,870
scientist so I decided to make this

670
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:03,200
cartoon so I think but like this so

671
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:05,928
rabid OPS's is like one radar to detect

672
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,720
things and something goes wrong it sends

673
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:12,048
a firetruck every time brassicas got

674
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,380
radar sonar you know everything are and

675
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:17,329
it sends a firetruck a helicopter or a

676
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,028
boat depending on what kind of stresses

677
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,230
happen right so brassicas or anything

678
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:23,538
that has these kind of polyploid

679
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,829
networks have a lot more flexibility and

680
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:27,408
the kind of things that they can do in a

681
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:29,000
either a sub or neo functionalization

682
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:30,680
functionalized context let alone a

683
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,390
dosage context

684
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,180
okay so to dive further into this since

685
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,400
2013 we've made a pretty exhaustive

686
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,660
catalogue of concern non-coding

687
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,740
sequences among the brass a--casey so

688
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,060
I'm going to show a couple cartoons

689
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,009
where I have a gene that looks like this

690
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,450
where there's two green exons and a

691
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:51,019
bunch of little CMS's of these little

692
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,880
yellow boxes so after polyploidy this is

693
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:55,789
what you often see so on the top is an

694
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,580
Arabidopsis gene it's got 1 2 3 4 5 6

695
00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:00,559
CNS is and it's got two exons if you

696
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,179
look in Brassica almost none of them

697
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,379
will look totally like that but you have

698
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,940
the one in the least fraction in the

699
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,890
genome will have all the exons and most

700
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,930
of those CMS's and then the two other

701
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,860
sub genomes we either have a loss or

702
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:17,330
have more CNS is lost so what is this so

703
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:20,119
Edie pay attention this is your slide so

704
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:21,379
CNS loss is consistent with sub

705
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,469
functionalization following gene

706
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:29,680
duplication so you can use polyploidy

707
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:32,870
and polyploid aware a I to think about

708
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,610
constraints in these kind of models so

709
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:36,649
whenever somebody comes and gives a talk

710
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:38,299
I got the latest and greatest CRISPR

711
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,740
high-throughput blah blah blah and I'm

712
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:41,210
gonna do all these mutants I'm like well

713
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,920
you go ahead I'm gonna spend two hours

714
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,160
on my computer and figure out that 90%

715
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,150
of those things you want to do or crap

716
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,940
because evolution has already done the

717
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,680
experiment so for me like when I look

718
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,670
like the pain and project or some of

719
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,769
these other projects we have going on

720
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,170
we're gonna model the most of the space

721
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,970
out right to know where we need to go

722
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:03,529
after for doing actual targeted gene

723
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:08,299
editing so use evolution okay was that

724
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:10,279
okay ad are we good alright alright so

725
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,710
now it's no it's just so I have this

726
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:14,869
data for like every gene that's in a

727
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,340
rabid OPS's that we know enough about so

728
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,989
here's just one cartoon example of

729
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:20,569
fractionation mutagenesis that you can

730
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,309
appreciate it so on the on the left is

731
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:24,169
in Arabidopsis gene on the right are the

732
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:25,730
three versions of it and brassicas so

733
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,470
let's go look at some cells and this is

734
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,519
just crude tissue stuff so of course you

735
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,250
can see where we're going with this with

736
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,920
single cell technology today so if you

737
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,630
put this gene under a couple of time

738
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,550
courses in a rabbit OPS's in the morning

739
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,200
it goes up and then in the evening that

740
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,690
goes down my typical gene that's

741
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,670
responsible i/o CNS six is light

742
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,460
responsive so you'll notice over here

743
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,970
what's going on

744
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,319
Brassica so so this is God its CNS thing

745
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,100
here's scene so this one's gonna respond

746
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,809
to light so sure not just Brassica

747
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:55,109
homolog of this response just like that

748
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,029
one

749
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,639
this one's dead we have to worry about

750
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:01,440
that what about this one oh it doesn't

751
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,570
respond to light so it doesn't do

752
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,180
anything right no of course it does

753
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:07,980
stuff so this rabid office is Jean it's

754
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,750
like the fire track right it shows up

755
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,120
all the time every tissue does

756
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,519
everything this this gene acts just like

757
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,259
Brassica all tissues all the time always

758
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:21,059
on this one Oh shows up in the dark

759
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,710
shows up when they're sweating right so

760
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,539
this is the boat this is the speedboat

761
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,130
version right okay and then there's

762
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,839
whole like exhaustive gene and the

763
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,330
network's bonus so you get the idea

764
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:33,179
okay so take-home point number tweetable

765
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:37,529
point number one who's tweeting Thank

766
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:39,870
You Margaret God one person F so

767
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:43,139
tweetable point number one you can now

768
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:44,669
use these systems to think about we used

769
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,080
to use terms like new at sub

770
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,940
functionalisation talk about a single

771
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,079
gene right I'll come of a single G

772
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,140
política gene now we can think about

773
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:56,339
networks of these ways care of yeah you

774
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:59,910
on board okay not sure all right

775
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:02,069
so in my fantasy experiment you have a

776
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,320
thousand and one perfect genomes of a

777
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:05,819
rabbit offices including tandem and ten

778
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,289
of duplicates and polypoid ghupat goods

779
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,549
you have your thousand one braska is you

780
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:10,200
have your thousand one sorghum's you

781
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,099
have your thousand one mazes and you can

782
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,350
tie all this together to really

783
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,649
understand constraints and Jeff what did

784
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,909
you call it today homeostasis why do we

785
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,560
have I mean maybe the real question

786
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,540
isn't why are things different but how

787
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,889
do they stay the same when they have all

788
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,049
these pretty levels on top of them and

789
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,540
go through meiosis and make pollen and

790
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:29,339
eggs okay so I've been thinking about

791
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,109
this a lot along with Gen Y scammer and

792
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:34,049
Gaurav and others about how could this

793
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:36,000
affect both primary metabolism things

794
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,099
like ham and c4 as well as specialized

795
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,039
metabolism Mike glucosinolates or

796
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:46,379
cardiac glycosides or name your favorite

797
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:48,089
metabolic network okay good olá ratio so

798
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,570
now we're on to the dog so this part is

799
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,069
completely

800
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,359
unpublished it's totally tweetable

801
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:53,970
because we've talked about before but

802
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,319
this is all new ok so this work is what

803
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,210
I'm going to present to you days mostly

804
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,349
been by my graduate student McKenzie

805
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,110
Mabry on the

806
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:03,750
left this is part of again a USDA grant

807
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:07,079
with Mike Gore and Joanne Labatt and

808
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:09,150
some other people but we also have Sarah

809
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,579
Turner on the right who's in now Jeff

810
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,230
Ross Sbarro's Lobby UC Davis so I'm

811
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:15,210
going to show you transcriptome data but

812
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,740
Sarah's got genome data and together

813
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,960
they have all this other morphology and

814
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,009
phenomics and Ino makes and stuffs I'm

815
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,620
not going to talk about so today I'm

816
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:26,009
just gonna talk about wolves and dogs

817
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:28,379
okay so I love this new trend for deep

818
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,940
domestication because every time people

819
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,770
write a review paper let's start with

820
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,808
sack laments tomato they put in the

821
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,460
review paper this picture so I'm like if

822
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:37,139
I don't write the d domestication grant

823
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,970
for Brassica like the next month i'm a

824
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,860
fool right so but there's a problem with

825
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,089
this picture one it doesn't show how

826
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,839
those different things are related and

827
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:47,069
two that thing in the middle is fiction

828
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,589
there is no wild mustard plant that

829
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:51,599
looks like an annual herbaceous thing

830
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,339
that's a Chinese white kale that's a

831
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,359
domesticated thing so first of all what

832
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:55,619
the heck is that that we're gonna be

833
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,240
domesticated doesn't look anything like

834
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:03,479
that okay so who are the wolves and who

835
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,279
are the dogs so these are all the other

836
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,990
things by the way besides the kind of

837
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,490
five canonical cabbage broccoli Cockrell

838
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,980
you have as I learned yesterday they

839
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,579
were part of my trip so far Margaret and

840
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,519
Griff his grip here could God

841
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,960
so anyway grip hi we would all looked at

842
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,490
all these amazing there's like more

843
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,929
diversity in this field of kills and

844
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,308
I've seen in my whole lifetime it's so

845
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,350
there's all these different kales and

846
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:27,599
collards and walking-sticks like

847
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,709
phenomenal diversity like who cares

848
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,369
about dogs these are way cooler than

849
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,390
dogs okay so what's the progenitor

850
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,019
alright so here's some possible

851
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,520
progenitors

852
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,279
so unlike Brassica Rapa which occurs on

853
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,720
the continent raska relatives wild

854
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,190
relatives in sea genome which also have

855
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,509
9 chromosomes are mostly in the coastal

856
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,429
Mediterranean so they got these like

857
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,839
kind of really hard leaves they go like

858
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:47,190
looks like they're like can take salt

859
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,038
spray they're witty

860
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,798
at their base their perennial and these

861
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,929
are all the possible contenders for who

862
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,269
could be the extant closest relative to

863
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,610
Brasco relatio okay so there's been

864
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:00,418
three competing hypotheses out there so

865
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,959
if you're British

866
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:05,490
you like hypothesis the organism Britain

867
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,659
said of surprise no and so why would you

868
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,490
think that well if you go to the coast

869
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,419
of UK you find things that look like

870
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,490
wild cabbage

871
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,040
they're also on the coast of France and

872
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,450
Spain but

873
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,730
British don't care about that so you

874
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,500
think okay well British Wow cabbage

875
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,140
what's another so if you like the babble

876
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,430
of arguments which snob is also false

877
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,810
but like if you like the argument where

878
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,549
there's the most number of species that

879
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:26,679
should be the origin so the most number

880
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,200
of wild sea relatives are in southern

881
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,509
Italy Shaklee Sicily and Sardinia and

882
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Corsica and then recently people have

883
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:37,960
done phylogenetic work not on DNA but on

884
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,430
the words so if you do phylogenetic

885
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,860
analysis of the words of the species

886
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,470
Brassica Kritika which is on Crete

887
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:48,279
Nebraska Haryana switch is in Turkey and

888
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,990
neighboring area would be the progenitor

889
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,910
sorry not presenting wrong term the

890
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,410
extend sister species to domesticate by

891
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,590
scores so those are current three

892
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,150
hypothesis so let's see what we find

893
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:59,949
so we started this project and again

894
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,500
this really nice paper check it out came

895
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,269
out that shows this relationship where

896
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,609
you have cabbages kales Brussels sprouts

897
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:08,319
cobby's as one group cauliflower

898
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:09,969
broccoli call you know there's another

899
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,529
group and then Chinese kale sister the

900
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:14,289
rest of those but not really a good

901
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:17,769
analysis of what was sister to it as far

902
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,149
as the wild things go okay so I have two

903
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,579
questions I want to post here first

904
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,220
how are the wild relatives related to

905
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:27,789
each other and to boscola racy and where

906
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,529
they occur so who's the wolf and then

907
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:32,829
how are all these dogs related to each

908
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:34,269
other okay so this is i'm only going to

909
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:35,649
talk about i'm going to show you kind of

910
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,029
popjam phylogenetic trees today but

911
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,860
here's the data that we collected we've

912
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:40,629
done this for rapa old erasing apis and

913
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,159
some other things like arugula we grow

914
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,930
plants in a growth chamber we put them

915
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,029
in four replicates we have all these

916
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,410
leaves we have kind of a semi - but way

917
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,660
called undergrads who harvest these

918
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:52,360
things and do the little vials and so

919
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,090
you know leaf four is for RNA leaf 2 3 &amp;

920
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,429
4 is Leafs can leave to s 4 metabolomics

921
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:59,769
leaf 3 is for ayan omics and we have all

922
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,509
this data one undergrad brandon guidance

923
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,309
Kalka really got in a raspberry pie and

924
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,599
so he made these like raspberry pi

925
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,069
system for looking at it so we published

926
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:07,269
a little paper on this like this is like

927
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,220
a pretty thing so you wonder how you get

928
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:10,900
a high 50 papers you have a good

929
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,160
question like NZ mentoring undergrads

930
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,480
publish little papers like this along

931
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,960
the way about a method like raspberry pi

932
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,690
by totally cool undergrad project

933
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,669
okay so now some results so here's the

934
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,590
first PC I don't think my core is

935
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:27,450
seamless yet but anyway the first PCA

936
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:29,699
here is on the on the right are wild on

937
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,379
the left or all the domesticates and so

938
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,940
who are these guys here that are the

939
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:35,278
wild ones that are closest to

940
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,240
domesticates okay they are

941
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,638
Brassica Kritika and Braska ancona okay

942
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,079
so let's look at apologies so this is

943
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,758
the pretty typical these days in Philo

944
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,710
genomics if you look at this tree it has

945
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,118
100% bootstraps and you can run a

946
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,409
different program and also have

947
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:51,329
hundred-percent bootstraps it'll be a

948
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:52,619
different tree alright so bootstrap

949
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:55,528
values are kind of meaningless in this

950
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:56,788
era when you have 100% bootstrap for

951
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:58,440
conflicting relationships so that

952
00:33:56,788 --> 00:34:01,618
there's a whole other conversation have

953
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,409
about that okay so what we find a

954
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:05,730
monophyletic group of domesticates

955
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:08,280
Brassica Kritika sister to those

956
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,139
Brassica and kana those and then some

957
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,980
alternative topologies they flip or

958
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,690
they're both sister to the domesticates

959
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,119
that's and here's the other thing so

960
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:22,289
sorry my friends in the UK but your wild

961
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:26,608
cabbage on the coast is not wild it's

962
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:28,409
not a wolf it's a feral dog but it's a

963
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:30,119
feral dog okay so that's what she got

964
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,710
there and then within the domesticated

965
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,389
plants the domesticated brass keys you

966
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,000
got collard greens and cabbages and then

967
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:39,088
kuraby cauliflower broccolis and we got

968
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,480
lots more to do in this so I told you

969
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:43,679
that I told you that's okay so where we

970
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,690
go in the future so we have all this

971
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,980
other data to use not just for G wasps

972
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,750
and T wasps but we have all these

973
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,369
glucosinolates and things to work on we

974
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:54,329
have morphometrics and leaf scans to

975
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,889
play with and we may also work with Dan

976
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:58,260
xie wood or some other folks on this and

977
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,640
then finally the reason why I came here

978
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,140
was to go out yesterday and look at the

979
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,969
huge diversity set so we have this

980
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:04,858
amazing G wasp platform it would be so

981
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:07,348
easy to add some of these other things

982
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:09,058
that some of the students here have been

983
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:10,588
working on for Brassica and that would

984
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:11,880
be fun to do together and also for

985
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:14,639
machine learning from other thing from

986
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,619
phenotypes to enzymes like there's a lot

987
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,629
of things that would be fun to play with

988
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,579
with people here elsewhere and my last

989
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,910
little piece on this is on fertilization

990
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,559
so I like to think of polyploid polypoid

991
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:27,358
is and when doing a genome evolution but

992
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,700
I've been thinking about these little

993
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,779
feral dogs as ways to think about

994
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,879
investigation because it's like

995
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,670
domestication reverse so if we have

996
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,010
these witty cabbages off the coast of UK

997
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,930
France and Spain well guess what

998
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,079
they're also off the coast of California

999
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:44,338
so when I was undergrad at Berkeley in

1000
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,920
1986 Herbert Baker would talk about

1001
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:48,960
these wild cabbages that are now off the

1002
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,880
coast of California and that of D right

1003
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
they've like they become woody again

1004
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,000
right and so like this is like a huge

1005
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,740
project just sitting here to look at the

1006
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,869
parallel d domestication back to

1007
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:00,029
wittiness and preemie ality across these

1008
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,099
different habitats well and by the way

1009
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,349
if you go to the islands of no Canary

1010
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:06,930
Islands or Channel Islands and off the

1011
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:09,570
UK and Europe you get walking sticks

1012
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:11,519
these are 8 foot tall woody

1013
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,099
like so if I was if there's still money

1014
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,929
for a rabbit obvious biofuel money this

1015
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,210
would be the thing you'd want to work on

1016
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:21,419
but that money is not here anymore so

1017
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,039
that's too bad damn ok so how can we use

1018
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,230
this d domestication paralyzation

1019
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,779
process to understand crops in a rapidly

1020
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,130
changing environment

1021
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:34,410
okay so last part how am i doing on time

1022
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:36,900
how much time do I get oh good okay so

1023
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:38,759
last part so this is normally I do this

1024
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,838
thing switch they do the neo poly points

1025
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,030
and in with the base so this word this

1026
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,019
time I did it backwards experiment so so

1027
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,170
now I'm going to talk about what happens

1028
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:48,239
right after you make a poly so Brassica

1029
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,250
napus is classic heterosis right so on

1030
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,039
the left is a Brassica oleracea rapid

1031
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,250
cycling plant it's about this tall

1032
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:57,269
flowers and 30 days or so on the right

1033
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,429
is Brassica Rapa

1034
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:02,429
fast plan right Wisconsin fast plain

1035
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:03,059
flour super fast in the middle as

1036
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,309
Brassica napus

1037
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,019
are was it I think bushel has mini maize

1038
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,489
to the subversion mini maize so but it

1039
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,170
blasts cannabis things like this tall

1040
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:12,539
you know commercial canola is like this

1041
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,099
all right this thing is like this but I

1042
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:17,309
can we can do when we first made them we

1043
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,420
can do two of these a year so the origin

1044
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,679
of this experiment I don't know if you

1045
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,980
remember but you know learn Reece bird

1046
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:26,639
became famous for making three hybrid

1047
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,740
sunflowers three maybe five and

1048
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,269
comparing them to natural sunflower and

1049
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:31,709
showing that evolution repeated itself

1050
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:32,969
when you replay the evolutionary tape

1051
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,179
for chromosome rearrangements in

1052
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:37,649
SunPower so Tom Osborn where this star

1053
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:39,690
project started in Wisconsin and

1054
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:43,230
agronomy saw that experiment he's like

1055
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,789
three five like let's do a hundred

1056
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,130
so we made a hundred resynthesize

1057
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:48,719
Brassica napus lines but this is not in

1058
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,539
the area of next-gen sequencing this is

1059
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,209
the era of RFLPs and I could put 50 on a

1060
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:56,400
southern blot so that's like there's 50

1061
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,440
or not a hundred in this study so over

1062
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,570
time what happened is this is just a

1063
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,670
portrait of one of the lines myself

1064
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,380
themself themself them in like by

1065
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,420
generation one two three four five so

1066
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,858
this one became to work right other ones

1067
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,389
became early flowering other ones became

1068
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:11,400
way flowering so even though they start

1069
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:13,920
off with the same exact homozygous

1070
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,858
parents double haploid we got this huge

1071
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,420
change in phenotype so how could that

1072
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:20,670
happen

1073
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,670
man almost like his parents so we

1074
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,740
discovered some stuff and I'll show you

1075
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:29,490
so that big experiment was actually

1076
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:31,709
first thought of from one cross so in

1077
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:33,000
1995 coming song and Tom Osborne

1078
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,980
published a paper where they made some

1079
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,358
crosses now they weren't self plants and

1080
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,679
they were so but they showed dynamic

1081
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:39,630
changes and a lot of people didn't

1082
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,578
believe them a lot of people didn't

1083
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,950
believe that result so this was a more

1084
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,900
careful experiment where they had inbred

1085
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:48,210
lines of Rapinoe Laurasia and this is uh

1086
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,490
so Jeff was Eric Ron's your undergrad

1087
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,108
yes so Eric Tron's who was an undergrad

1088
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:53,338
here at Cornell in Jeff's lab came to

1089
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:54,598
Wisconsin I think I should want to work

1090
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:56,369
with Ken Sytsma but ended up in Tom

1091
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,500
Osborne's lab doing Brassica stuff so

1092
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:59,640
this is what Eric did sorry and the

1093
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,050
other nice thing is right down the

1094
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,848
hallway is Ricky I'm a senior's lab

1095
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,230
which is like a famous lab for working

1096
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:06,269
on flowering time network in Rabbid

1097
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,190
offices so eric had the smart idea to

1098
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:10,469
glue what a massino's lab was doing in

1099
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,608
rabbit ops LC and konstanz with always

1100
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:13,529
going a Brassica because there'd be

1101
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:15,480
three copies right of these flowering

1102
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,010
time genes so eric started to do this

1103
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,539
experiment we made these crosses and

1104
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,119
selected for early and late flowering

1105
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,769
and after six generations of selfing

1106
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,180
they're basically two species if you

1107
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:25,380
throw the seeds out the early flowering

1108
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:29,519
ones whenever seed the late flowering

1109
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,838
ones so had that happened so fast oh and

1110
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,829
by the way this was about the time when

1111
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,000
hopi huckster and other people were

1112
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:35,068
making a lot of hay about speciation

1113
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,858
genes so everybody wanted to find the

1114
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:40,440
speciation gene so we didn't find a

1115
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:43,230
speciation gene so then we did this big

1116
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,480
experiment we made 50 lines that were

1117
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,400
started so 50 independent lines it's not

1118
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,559
one line there's 50 independent lines

1119
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,269
and we sell them and we published the

1120
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,799
big paper and this was in 2007 and we

1121
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:54,780
followed up in 2011 and I'll show you

1122
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,369
some new stuff next but when you first

1123
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,940
made them they're all identical but

1124
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,740
after

1125
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,829
even five generations of cell fame they

1126
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:04,949
were really diverged both genetically

1127
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:07,349
epigenetically and phenotypically so

1128
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:09,750
here's I I think this is the only slide

1129
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,068
I also showed in 2005 but I always show

1130
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,768
it again and again so this is my most

1131
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:16,558
important slide and you have to learn

1132
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:18,899
how to spell homie ologists after this

1133
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,730
okay so these are rearranged macaws by

1134
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,318
homie Allah guests recombination so you

1135
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:24,630
know in a diploid so in green is

1136
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,568
Brassica Rapa diploid ellos breast glory

1137
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,369
circle they have homologous 100

1138
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:30,989
chromosome exchange and aloe polypoid

1139
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:33,720
they have homie all that gets you had

1140
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:35,788
two bowels not one Val two vowels homie

1141
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:37,288
Allah Gaston exchanges so if you ever

1142
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:40,500
get that reviewer comment how to spell

1143
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:42,778
ho Malik has changed that was me or Jim

1144
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,028
burglar so as a result of homologous

1145
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:47,179
chromosome exchanges you can have so

1146
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:49,469
okay so these changes are reciprocal

1147
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:51,028
right the exchanges are reciprocal but

1148
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:54,179
as a result of a punnett square you can

1149
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:55,318
have non reciprocal inheritance okay so

1150
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:57,088
you can get results that look like this

1151
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,150
you can also get reciprocal exchanges

1152
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:03,838
okay so these rearrangements can have

1153
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,548
huge effect on dosage and we called them

1154
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,078
speciation rearrangements time so

1155
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:09,329
imagine that these bubbles are phenotype

1156
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:11,160
so let's say F LC and konstanz are here

1157
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:13,318
Brassica Rapa and the big circles

1158
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,028
flowers and say 10 days Brassica

1159
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:16,920
oleracea and a little circles flowers

1160
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:19,199
and say 30 days and the mid parent

1161
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,278
flowering time for napus is 20 days you

1162
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:21,629
have a chromosome rearrangement on the

1163
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,670
one on the top and the one on the bottom

1164
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,289
you have the two separate flowering

1165
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,298
times right and you can do that for any

1166
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:29,759
pathway right whether it's firing time

1167
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:31,380
or glucosinolates or whatever so does

1168
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:33,389
this happen a lot so we published this

1169
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,769
result and again just like the 95 papers

1170
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:36,389
list so we don't believe it oh now we

1171
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:38,008
believe it but it's only true in your

1172
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:40,528
recent besides lines never happens in

1173
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:43,858
nature so then we think was the genome

1174
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:45,630
and in the genome we found 17 17 homie

1175
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:47,130
all August exchanges and then people

1176
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,108
said okay well that's fine only occurs

1177
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,789
in recent the size Brassica you're crazy

1178
00:41:49,108 --> 00:41:52,920
crop brass can use but doesn't happen

1179
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:54,269
any other crop well then after we

1180
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,639
published this paper was found in weeds

1181
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:59,848
and then strawberry and then track your

1182
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,379
pogon then bunch of grasses so if you

1183
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,150
don't know about homologous exchanges

1184
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,250
and you're doing pan genome work across

1185
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,660
any group of plants you should really

1186
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,659
think about this is a source of

1187
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,190
variation if you're now looking at copy

1188
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:13,518
number

1189
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,500
or presence/absence various should you

1190
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:16,909
care if you're a plant breeder this

1191
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,798
sounds pretty obscure to me I don't know

1192
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,629
who cares about these ChromeOS okay so

1193
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:23,000
here is the picture of the homologous

1194
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:26,059
exchanges across winter canola

1195
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,759
darm or Bristol spring canola it be so

1196
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:30,019
some Japanese and Korean types synthetic

1197
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,559
type the kale one that I'll show you

1198
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:34,068
next

1199
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:35,269
kale type napus in a sweet rutabaga all

1200
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:37,670
those color boxes are homologous

1201
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:41,500
exchanges I just highlight one in green

1202
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:44,539
that's glucosinolates so good suddenly

1203
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,009
evolution totally partly at least

1204
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:48,019
responsible for by these homologous

1205
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:49,009
regions and then we also see these for

1206
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:53,538
all kinds of other things

1207
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:55,759
and now another crops so this this this

1208
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:57,170
these 50 lines haven't died so we're

1209
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:58,880
still replaying the evolutionary tape so

1210
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,528
this paper was post on a bio archive I

1211
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,150
think two days ago it's actually called

1212
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:03,619
replaying the evolutionary tape to

1213
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,460
investigate sub genome dominance now a

1214
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:07,730
Brassica napus

1215
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,769
so Kevin Burge hadn't either hooth Melea

1216
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:12,019
gihan bunch of a bunch of other people

1217
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:14,268
led by um pat edger and rob and urine

1218
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:16,459
they looked at deeply at 6 of these 50

1219
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:18,558
lines and they looked at methylation

1220
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,028
bias homologous expression and what are

1221
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,920
they finding guess what repeated

1222
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:23,420
patterns so it really matters everything

1223
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,829
about constraints what happens who are

1224
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,240
the parents who's the mom who's the dad

1225
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:28,160
and you'll see the same things happening

1226
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,328
over and over again so again you don't

1227
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,848
have to CRISPR out everything you can

1228
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:33,980
learn something from evolution so ok

1229
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:36,619
Margaret B my Twitter person okay here's

1230
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:41,389
Twitter point number 2 so you can find

1231
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:43,940
by making synthetic a low poly poids you

1232
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:45,710
can see things happen faster like

1233
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,659
homologous exchanges so you will believe

1234
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,769
them because you see them faster and

1235
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,298
over and over again you don't think it's

1236
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,949
an experimental error you're just think

1237
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:53,059
oh my god homie Alex exchanges actually

1238
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:55,518
happened they're not gene conversion

1239
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:56,778
events they're homologous exchanges you

1240
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:57,979
need you there no and then you don't see

1241
00:43:56,778 --> 00:43:59,210
them as being weird you've seen them as

1242
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,139
something that are real and then

1243
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,150
suddenly you could see them not just

1244
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:06,379
Nebraska but be peanut and whole bunch

1245
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:09,769
of other things now ok so what about the

1246
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,180
history of Brassica so Brassica napus of

1247
00:44:09,768 --> 00:44:14,328
course is known a part of the triangle

1248
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:16,338
view originated from the combination of

1249
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,650
Brassica Rapa the AAA genome and brass

1250
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:20,298
collar Asya the CC genome so

1251
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,210
long-standing questions which of these

1252
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:26,659
vegetables are the parents

1253
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,519
and then once you get Brassica napus you

1254
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:30,289
have further diversification into

1255
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,389
oleifera which is a rapeseed types

1256
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:34,940
subspecies were pepper which is really

1257
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:36,949
bigger speed Swede and fabulo a which is

1258
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,318
Siberian kale so if you think about

1259
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:40,519
multiple origins are these different are

1260
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:42,019
these different warfare types different

1261
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:43,639
multiple origins or do they diversify

1262
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,230
from the same thing and then finally you

1263
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:48,230
have big differences in both winter and

1264
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:49,849
spring types so when we started this

1265
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,710
project we had reference genomes for

1266
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:53,059
Brassica Rapa Brassica oleracea brass

1267
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,068
cannabis and we did a massive

1268
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:56,030
transcriptome and now resequencing study

1269
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,369
but I'm just going to show you the

1270
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,869
transcriptome stuff today and so the big

1271
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:01,940
question for this and this is a study

1272
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:03,920
led by home on he came to my lab from

1273
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,108
Wuhan as a visiting PhD student and his

1274
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,430
now stayed on was a postdoc and this

1275
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:09,380
paper was just published recently in

1276
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:11,598
Nature communication his big question

1277
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,550
for his PhD project was is it true that

1278
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,539
there's multiple origins of Brassica

1279
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,789
napus because that's what's in the

1280
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,769
literature and if it's true

1281
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:20,509
how do multiple versions happen do the

1282
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:22,369
rutabagas wheat types evolved from

1283
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,140
things like turnip and kohlrabi do the

1284
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:26,119
leafy siberian kales evolve from things

1285
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:28,429
like the leafy brassicas and of the oil

1286
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:30,849
seeds of all things like the sarsens or

1287
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:33,379
were there multiple origins to one thing

1288
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:36,260
like an oil seed type and then they

1289
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,838
diversified or was there a single origin

1290
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,950
so this was this is the three options

1291
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:44,449
for what he was pursuing okay and so we

1292
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,009
got a global collection of Brassica

1293
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:47,719
napus and unlike a lot of other studies

1294
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:50,839
we include a rutabaga and siberian kale

1295
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:53,480
we did like some really nice generated a

1296
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:54,529
lot of really nice RNA cka NGSS data and

1297
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,818
here's the for those of you are

1298
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,319
interested methodology here's the

1299
00:45:55,818 --> 00:46:00,019
methodological take-home at this point

1300
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:01,519
it really mattered whether you used a

1301
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:02,869
reference genome a single reference

1302
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,000
genome or whether you used a pan

1303
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,530
transcriptome or pan genome the

1304
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,909
groupings weren't differed in structure

1305
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,410
but the pile of genetic trees were

1306
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:11,960
really different so if you're thinking

1307
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:14,058
about that that would be what I think is

1308
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,980
the big take home with this paper and so

1309
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:17,089
there's home and this is the paper that

1310
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,699
I'm going to be talking about for the

1311
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:21,019
next few slides that just came out okay

1312
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:22,399
so the first big result was we

1313
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:25,849
discovered a new group of Brassica napus

1314
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,068
so we have the typical rapeseed types in

1315
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:31,099
Europe and North America and in Asia and

1316
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:33,679
then you have spring types and then you

1317
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,880
have Siberian kales and you have

1318
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,199
rutabagas and then there's this

1319
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,140
interesting little group I'll come back

1320
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:42,389
to later

1321
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:43,980
intro s right here okay now if you make

1322
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:45,808
it free so this is where it gets wonky

1323
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,940
so we always get these four monophyletic

1324
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:49,410
groups so rutabagas Siberian kale winter

1325
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,510
rapeseed in East Asia and spring

1326
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:53,250
rapeseed are always one group every time

1327
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,528
you look no matter hey look these other

1328
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,480
winter rape seeds that occur in Europe

1329
00:46:55,528 --> 00:47:00,539
and America and Asia are a paraphyletic

1330
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,980
mess at the base of this and then the

1331
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:03,900
relationships among that paraphyletic

1332
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,490
mess and all those form on top for the

1333
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,108
groups really vary depending on what

1334
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,848
methods you use to make this kind of do

1335
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:10,139
this kind of tree building exercises and

1336
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:11,190
there's also Network versions of this

1337
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:17,190
but I'm just sharing the cartoon version

1338
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:18,450
of it today okay so I've been thinking

1339
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,460
about you know we started with this

1340
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:21,689
Brassica napus who's your mother you

1341
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,920
know so there's a baby bird that runs

1342
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,970
around asking all the other animals

1343
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,960
about who's your mother we still don't

1344
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:26,399
know who the mother is

1345
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,639
because I don't think we have the right

1346
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,440
diploid extant relatives but then my

1347
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:34,710
Chinese postdoc says we know that that

1348
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,778
story isn't a really original story and

1349
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:39,150
China we have the story except it's a

1350
00:47:36,778 --> 00:47:40,949
tadpole so he showed me these stamps

1351
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:43,048
where the tadpole runs around and asked

1352
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:44,548
the fish in the crab and who's your

1353
00:47:43,048 --> 00:47:47,460
mother so I didn't realize this is one

1354
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:48,599
of those cross-cultural stories are you

1355
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,789
my mother so we haven't figured this out

1356
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,950
for neighbors either

1357
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:54,630
all right so just to finish up this this

1358
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:57,960
with this paper had in it so we found

1359
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:59,700
these six Brassica napus groups there's

1360
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,909
a ton of admixture across them

1361
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:05,429
particularly that will seed varieties we

1362
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:06,808
can't confirm what the general tale is

1363
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:09,929
that multiple origins happen it seems

1364
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:11,460
that section more like back crossing the

1365
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,048
nuclear organelle or for lodgings

1366
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,119
actually showed that that intro s group

1367
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:16,460
that we discovered is when you sow in

1368
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,048
China they used to grow Brassica Rapa

1369
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,699
for the oil seeds and after World War 2

1370
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:22,380
they grew Brassica napus but they back

1371
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:23,639
crossed it to Brassica Rapa for disease

1372
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,740
resistance and other things so that's

1373
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,298
what that group is is just the

1374
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,669
introgression YZ group that's got these

1375
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:30,929
other ones in it and then I didn't talk

1376
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,278
about it today but basically you looked

1377
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:33,899
really hard for all the selective sweeps

1378
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:35,338
we found focusing on rutabagas and

1379
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,769
Siberian kales because everybody else is

1380
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:39,568
looking up oil seeds we have a lot of

1381
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:41,129
fighter hormones to chase down and other

1382
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:43,349
kind of metabolic things to go after and

1383
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,108
just like with Brassica Rapa nuis

1384
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:48,930
there's this obvious sub genome both

1385
00:48:46,108 --> 00:48:50,049
physical asymmetry and expression

1386
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,809
asymmetry and healthy

1387
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,150
show themselves and so where we're going

1388
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:56,380
with next on this is I think Mike Gore

1389
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,059
and John McCain a bunch of people have

1390
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,130
pan genomes a bunch of the canola types

1391
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:01,630
we're making pan genomes of rutabaga and

1392
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,920
Siberian kale hopefully someday we'll

1393
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,440
bring all these together and have a big

1394
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,030
party and then of course we're Chris

1395
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,380
bring out every else is doing oil seeds

1396
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,840
and glucose amides we're actually going

1397
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:14,380
after some other targets that nobody

1398
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:16,750
else cares about so the future so here's

1399
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,340
my future this is my ed buck ed this is

1400
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:22,480
your slide number two for you and

1401
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:24,490
friends so from a sub genome assignments

1402
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,199
are problematic if they're just sorghum

1403
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:28,149
and maize comparisons you need other

1404
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:29,710
genomes to fill in who the parents are

1405
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,789
to do it right it still biased

1406
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,670
fractionation but it's going to be

1407
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:35,619
definitely so in general as a good

1408
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,720
system a distant file geneticist move

1409
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:39,190
away from pairwise comparisons to pilo

1410
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:40,959
genomic comparisons that's message

1411
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,730
number one no matter what your omics and

1412
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,949
then think about the modeling so how

1413
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,590
would you model you know what

1414
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,849
deleterious alleles you want to go after

1415
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:50,800
using the framework of both Philo

1416
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:53,529
genomics and population genetics so we

1417
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,410
spelled this out and a 20-18 paper and

1418
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,970
err yes and then we've had a couple of

1419
00:49:56,409 --> 00:50:00,759
some other thought pieces about this

1420
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:02,319
both with gal rob and aj b Sarah turned

1421
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,030
her song and Jeff Rossen a bar and I

1422
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,550
talked about these evolutionary insights

1423
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,290
impacting plant breeding so what reading

1424
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,900
5.0 I don't know what we would call that

1425
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:12,009
and then and this is an older paper but

1426
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,170
I should be read it on the plane out

1427
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,610
here Jacob Washburn and some of us wrote

1428
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,740
this paper on convergent evolution and I

1429
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,380
think that there are some nice ideas and

1430
00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:21,729
they're about thinking about constraints

1431
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,970
so I will just end by acknowledging my

1432
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,429
funding sources including USDA which is

1433
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:28,989
new for me because I have friends here

1434
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:31,839
National Geographic is new so now I get

1435
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:33,009
up have music or so that I don't know

1436
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,660
what that means exactly for National

1437
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,940
Geographic and I and I didn't talk about

1438
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:39,339
today but we have a small D we do II

1439
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,349
grant do you t I'm using brassicas a

1440
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,340
low-dose radiation sensor which actually

1441
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:44,469
can just plug in with all the other

1442
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,970
stuff that we got going on and JG is

1443
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:47,319
giving us a ton data and I didn't talk

1444
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:49,209
about an orchid mycorrhizal fungi

1445
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,680
project today and so these are the

1446
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,679
people that do the work so I talked

1447
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:57,129
mostly about the work done by Mackenzie

1448
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,599
Oman and these are new students who are

1449
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,400
working on various projects that have to

1450
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:02,199
do that follow-up mostly CRISPR and

1451
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,910
functional genomics and I have had this

1452
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,739
great visiting scientist

1453
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:07,328
why don't you shun from China this year

1454
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:09,669
has been helping us with double haploids

1455
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:11,410
and CRISPR also and the what I'm most

1456
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,059
proud of our lab these are undergrads

1457
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:15,399
because they come in as whatever

1458
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:17,410
pre-meds or not knowing anything really

1459
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,720
and they end up going to grad school

1460
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:22,298
grad school over the all over the world

1461
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,618
doing cool stuff so thank you fun last

1462
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:25,420
fun fact we didn't know it

1463
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:27,039
pumpkins were really good really cool

1464
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,950
for people because like they used to

1465
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,028
carve turnips and rutabaga and it was

1466
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,828
really hard you got your hands doll

1467
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:34,719
bloody so our lab is an annual turnip

1468
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:36,339
carving party rutabaga party this last

1469
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,679
year we'll do step back this here but

1470
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:41,500
home much prefers to park our pumpkins

1471
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:54,778
down into these so all right so that's

1472
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:54,778
it thank you questions I can handle it

1473
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:02,519
awesome all clear clear as mud alright

1474
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,519
go

1475
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:30,880
so the modern that was the guy sending

1476
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:33,490
out all images for stress but is it that

1477
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,759
it's just that team is on the way

1478
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:39,250
personalization and it just regains of

1479
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:43,838
the activities that were there before by

1480
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:47,440
chance I start it's not selected

1481
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:49,150
response public instead it so yeah so

1482
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,470
this is Gavin carnival here you would

1483
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,509
love your question so we actually wrote

1484
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:54,308
a paper about noise we Swiney in the

1485
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:56,349
progeny so you have to distinguish noise

1486
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:58,000
which I would saw things on the way the

1487
00:52:56,349 --> 00:53:00,519
solution ization versus things that are

1488
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,318
fixed by sub-conscience ation right if

1489
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:04,209
yeah it's true original for son when to

1490
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:05,889
stop vocalization there's you're stuck

1491
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,329
with them or you can't get rid of them

1492
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:08,469
but if it's these things that it's kind

1493
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:10,089
of noisy and they're on their way out

1494
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:11,618
again like you're still playing so this

1495
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:13,808
is why I like your work on enzymes

1496
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:14,950
because okay so in poly play was

1497
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,450
everyone to do they once he probably put

1498
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:17,469
it on the tree and they want a map that

1499
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:19,059
where that probably put even

1500
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:20,828
you have diversification no yep Olli

1501
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:21,969
play well and evolutions got to tinker

1502
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:23,079
around and pick out how the young signs

1503
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,919
are gonna find their substrates or

1504
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:25,420
figure out how they're gonna do their

1505
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,500
homeostasis game oh boy and then you get

1506
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,450
a novel trait and then they can

1507
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,429
diversify right so what's the time lag

1508
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:32,919
for that so for me thinking about AI or

1509
00:53:30,429 --> 00:53:35,199
or whatever what's the time frame that I

1510
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:38,019
want to look at after polyploidy like so

1511
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,189
how far is it like is the if I'm what

1512
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,960
path when you're looking at do I want to

1513
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:42,429
look at the music polypoid events the

1514
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,409
alpha-beta events or the Brassica napus

1515
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,608
event so I don't know what your enzyme

1516
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,868
you're working on or whatever but for me

1517
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:48,369
that's like where I would start with

1518
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:51,460
answering a question or whether it's

1519
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:53,950
cardiac glycosides or but most of these

1520
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:56,230
I think are fixed if they're like have

1521
00:53:53,949 --> 00:53:57,909
really deep partitioning between tissues

1522
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:00,280
and and so the thing we've been trying

1523
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:01,358
to model is to gen-y skateboard I have

1524
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,740
been thinking about well if I really

1525
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,309
wouldn't about the glucosinolate module

1526
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:07,989
how do i spread my the dollars between

1527
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,549
different species sessions within a

1528
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:12,250
species and tissues and time points

1529
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,839
right and so like okay well let's think

1530
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,489
about that yeah if you have somebody

1531
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,199
prior idea about how big the module is

1532
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:18,789
you can figure that out right or what

1533
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:20,199
the gold standard stress is it's going

1534
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,909
to do five things instead of one thing

1535
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:23,500
copper sulfate instead of methyl just

1536
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:26,440
maybe or I don't know I'm making that

1537
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,088
but anyway so some of these are noisy

1538
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,099
right but that's when we look at a pot

1539
00:54:28,088 --> 00:54:31,838
so I showed you a canonical example but

1540
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:32,829
in a pop gym framework and maybe some

1541
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:34,568
other things like they don't look as

1542
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:36,760
clean as that oh maybe this pseudogene

1543
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:38,710
izing and that Rab adopts this cold wine

1544
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,210
but not in a RAB job just layer or I

1545
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,800
don't know if that answers your question

1546
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:46,409
but we're just looking at a snapshot by

1547
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,410
which is why you need to test notes so

1548
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,869
trend towards woodenness you get so you

1549
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:09,480
can think about the things that cause

1550
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:13,900
the domestication by what exactly

1551
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,608
constraint begin so do you think the

1552
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,000
witness was on islands where you see

1553
00:55:15,608 --> 00:55:20,289
plants growing anyway so is there any

1554
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,358
are there any insights that are jumping

1555
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:25,779
out from that that you hadn't maybe some

1556
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:28,838
of that that are providing an idea of

1557
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,610
what that canalization process is and

1558
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:33,880
why you don't see

1559
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:36,160
such overwhelming diversity of forms

1560
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:40,750
given the overwhelming genetic potential

1561
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:42,309
and variation that's out there version

1562
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:49,929
of the question for people on Zoo

1563
00:55:42,309 --> 00:56:07,960
soar is it

1564
00:55:49,929 --> 00:56:09,879
do we see canalization yeah so so the

1565
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,470
question is do we see any patterns of

1566
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,890
the domestication that may tell us about

1567
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:18,459
some central process yes okay we don't

1568
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:19,539
know yet we're just starting so for me

1569
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,820
though again it's like what's the scale

1570
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:23,829
the problem are we trying to figure out

1571
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,480
okay and Brassica how does Brassica

1572
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:26,920
become woody or do we want to look at

1573
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,869
like well how do all frog plants become

1574
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,130
woody and look at s Tracy also and some

1575
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:31,960
other ones right and so there's a

1576
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,940
project in in Europe where people are

1577
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,769
looking at wittiness while baying both

1578
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,260
naturally on islands mostly these kind

1579
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:39,759
of T domesticated types so I'm curious

1580
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,930
things you're sure so just to narrow the

1581
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,840
question a little bit so things that

1582
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:45,339
share the same hexaploid e in the purse

1583
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,800
to see what's the difference between

1584
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,329
things that were perennial that then

1585
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,280
became more woody versus things that

1586
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:53,500
were domesticated in Deraa basis and now

1587
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,780
become woody kind of what can I learn

1588
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,639
about wood enos from the difference

1589
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,110
between those two right and are there

1590
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:00,699
constraints are they as always the same

1591
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,870
little switch is similar transcriptional

1592
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:07,269
factors over and over again so that's

1593
00:57:01,869 --> 00:57:14,980
the question I don't know the answer any

1594
00:57:07,269 --> 00:57:22,650
other questions I can't answer one more

1595
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:22,650
question than we got to go so you know

1596
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:39,489
the helicopter in Nice is that okay yeah

1597
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:41,409
clearly it didn't go that same route

1598
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:44,000
right so what you thought about this or

1599
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:47,710
the negative asked

1600
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,449
so maintaining some of those options

1601
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,889
maintaining extra copies of jeans

1602
00:57:50,449 --> 00:57:53,899
well there's clear I mean you mostly

1603
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:55,339
have gene loss to drift and clearly I

1604
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,139
mean we all know that genome size is a

1605
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,210
huge cost right I mean rabid office

1606
00:57:57,139 --> 00:58:02,839
entire lifecycle occurs in the time span

1607
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:06,889
that lilium does meiosis so you know if

1608
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:10,010
I had to choose Oh vast and weedy yeah

1609
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:11,059
but but I just think trying to broaden

1610
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,650
your question or thinking about

1611
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:14,210
constraint there's different ways to

1612
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,608
have variation too right so like spice

1613
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:19,130
variants or you know transposon all blah

1614
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:20,358
so I'm just focusing on my own research

1615
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,950
program it's just trying to focus on

1616
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:23,090
tandem versus probably play duplicates

1617
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:24,679
but there's a lot of ways that variation

1618
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:28,250
could happen and certainly there's

1619
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:29,719
genomic so when I think of genomic

1620
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:32,329
architecture that's what I'm thinking of

1621
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:34,129
is it's kind of network architecture and

1622
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:39,069
so what did a rabid offices give up by

1623
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:39,070
giving up those other networks right I

1624
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,779
don't know

1625
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:45,739
doesn't have but doesn't have a

1626
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:47,330
helicopter but has a pretty fast speed

1627
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:51,979
you know it has a pretty fast boat right

1628
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:55,400
so can I poorly answer another question

1629
00:58:51,980 --> 00:59:07,159
I've done two I'm two for two on zero or

1630
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:09,230
it's time to go time to go sorry this

1631
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:14,799
has been a production of Cornell

1632
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:14,800
