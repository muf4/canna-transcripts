00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,660
this is a production of Cornell

00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:07,099
University

00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,330
hi I'm Rebecca Benner on the science and

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:09,949
strategy director for the Nature

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,469
Conservancy of New York and it's really

6
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:14,660
exciting to be here today and I took my

7
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:16,038
time thinking all the right people I

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,769
would run out of my five minutes so

9
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,330
consider yourself Thanks The Nature

10
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,519
Conservancy is a global conservation

11
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:24,529
nonprofit we work in all 50 states

12
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,160
across the country in 72 countries

13
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,080
across the world and our global program

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,960
as Dave mentioned has been working in

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,420
agriculture for a really long time in a

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,768
number of different ways but now we're

17
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,390
really thinking a lot more about soil

18
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:40,460
and I actually stole that tagline

19
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,829
rethink soil from our global team and

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,359
the Nature Conservancy in general is

21
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,530
thinking a lot about this nexus between

22
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:50,269
food water and climate change I'll say

23
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,129
that the Nature Conservancy in New York

24
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:53,658
we're actually somewhat new to thinking

25
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:55,789
about this and to working with all of

26
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:57,738
you in this space and we're really

27
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,989
excited to be here today to learn from

28
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:03,408
you and to understand how we can

29
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,609
contribute to this ongoing dialogue so

30
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,679
I'm going to tell you a little bit about

31
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:09,140
the stuff that we do in New York and how

32
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,210
it relates to soils I'm hoping that as

33
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,829
we continue this dialogue we learn how

34
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,199
we can add value to these conversations

35
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:17,449
so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
water you might say why is she talking

37
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,840
about water when this is about soils

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,490
partly that's because dave told me too

39
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,469
but the other reason is because we've

40
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:25,670
been working around water for a really

41
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:27,288
long time and we think there's a

42
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,899
beautiful nexus with soil health and

43
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:31,670
water health so I'm going to show you a

44
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,108
little bit some of the science that

45
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,329
we've brought to the table around water

46
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:37,608
quality and I can say that these maps

47
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,898
though they're very pretty if you look

48
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:42,679
at the story behind them it's a little

49
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:44,450
bit disturbing so this is a map that is

50
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,368
done based on the sparrow model from

51
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,259
USGS by one of our scientists at the

52
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:50,239
Nature Conservancy but it's really

53
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,920
trying to do is it's a modeling exercise

54
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,478
so I'll just put that out there it's

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,399
trying to understand that if we had a

56
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,019
proposed standard around water Claudie

57
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,478
New York which the state did propose a

58
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:01,670
while ago where would we be in terms of

59
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,590
meeting that standard darker the purple

60
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,780
the further away from that standard so

61
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,799
in this case we're looking at nitrogen

62
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,538
barkas purple would be greater than five

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,039
times above the standards in terms of

64
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,449
the nitrogen concentrations that we

65
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,458
would want in our waterways to have

66
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,408
healthy waters the only places that

67
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,120
actually would excuse me meet the

68
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,989
standard would be the Adirondacks and

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,210
the Catskills you

70
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,460
see those areas a colorful map in the

71
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,500
lower left that's trying to tell you

72
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,480
what those sources of nitrogen are that

73
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,069
beautiful blue is actually atmospheric

74
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,619
deposition so we have a huge amount of

75
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,530
atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in

76
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,780
New York the orange is agriculture

77
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,360
the yellow is nurse and more relevant to

78
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,919
the conversations we're having today

79
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,590
similar story around phosphorus again

80
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,509
the darker greens are probably a or more

81
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,729
about in terms of the concentrations

82
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:49,699
above this proposed standard and again

83
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:51,649
in the lower left you see the powerful

84
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:54,199
map that tells you sort of where those

85
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,849
contributions are coming from again here

86
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,319
you can see the yellow really driving

87
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,349
most of that picture other than the

88
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,989
green the yellow is really is manure and

89
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,180
then again the orange is agriculture and

90
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,740
so this tells a story about our waters

91
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,150
it tells us a little bit about what's

92
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,370
happening with nutrients in our waters

93
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,580
at the Nature Conservancy we feel this

94
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,500
is all of our issue and the community's

95
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,630
issues to solve we all benefit from

96
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,479
having cleaner water we need clean water

97
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,009
to have production of food New York is

98
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,840
one of the most important food producers

99
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:25,489
we need to be able to continue to play

100
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,140
in that sphere with climate change and

101
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,550
somebody already mentioned this New

102
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,009
York's importance in the agricultural

103
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,469
sphere will only increase so together we

104
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,969
need to start thinking about our waters

105
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,490
and make sure that they're healthy and

106
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:39,319
this is where I come to soils so the

107
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,939
Nature Conservancy as I said is really

108
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,729
thinking about this nexus between soil

109
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:45,079
water and climate change in New York we

110
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,729
have been working a lot on climate

111
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,110
mitigation particularly trying to work

112
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,389
with the state to achieve our very

113
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,740
ambitious renewable energy targets but

114
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:53,209
now we're actually turning 4 it's

115
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,879
thinking about how does nature play a

116
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,379
role in sequestering carbon so of course

117
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,449
as a Nature Conservancy we've been

118
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,829
thinking a lot about forests and I

119
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,359
suspect you'll hear more of this from

120
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,250
our colleagues at Cornell a little bit

121
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,810
later today we're actually starting to

122
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,030
think a little bit about how does

123
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,360
changing agricultural practices actually

124
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,069
helps to sequester and store carbon

125
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,140
similar to many of the things they've

126
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,298
talked about earlier so the Nature

127
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,639
Conservancy's soil health program really

128
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,560
focuses on cover crops crop rotation and

129
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,149
reduced tillage we are part of many

130
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,470
national partnerships including the soil

131
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:26,029
health partnership which is a

132
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,160
partnership created by the natural Corn

133
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:30,469
Growers Association and they are

134
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,610
collecting data off of farms all across

135
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,439
the country to try to

136
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,870
understand the benefits of soil health

137
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,889
practices we also think a lot about how

138
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,658
does that relate to nutrient management

139
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,340
we are incredibly excited to be a

140
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:43,550
partner in the for our program there's a

141
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:44,929
4-hour nutrient stewardship table right

142
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,699
over there you can learn more about it

143
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,550
working with my Sabba and the fertilizer

144
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,199
institute thinking about how do we work

145
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,788
with nutrient applications to actually

146
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,728
do better nutrient management on our

147
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:57,769
farms and how does this then link to

148
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,598
carbon storage and the ability of nature

149
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:01,639
to help us fight against global climate

150
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,829
change so that's really the Nexus that

151
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,718
we hope to actually add value and bring

152
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:08,508
to the table we have a lot of expertise

153
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:10,579
on science a lot on water a lot on

154
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,759
climate mitigation we're really excited

155
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:15,709
to be part of this dialogue and we hope

156
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,680
and we are learning from all of you

157
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:27,500
about how food water climate all comes

158
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:30,528
together in our soils this has been a

159
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,750
