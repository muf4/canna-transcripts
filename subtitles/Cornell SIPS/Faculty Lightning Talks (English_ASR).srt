1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,679
University so thank you uh Jillian first

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,320
for the invitation and Jos and Lou for

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:20,679
organizing these across all the sections

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:25,839
um so my name is g m i uh grew up in

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:28,079
Mumbai uh India and um did my bachelor's

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,679
in microbiology my masters in

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,519
Biochemistry then I came here in 2007 uh

9
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,878
at Michigan State where I did my postdoc

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,840
PhD and postdoc and joined Cornell in

11
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:44,479
2017 so my lab here is working on uh

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,320
various aspects of plant biochemistry

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,159
I'm going to talk about two projects one

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,280
is uh a more computational project on

15
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:54,238
predicting enzyme function and the

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,039
second is more wet lab aspects of things

17
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,599
where we looking at the mechanisms

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,558
behind uh stress response mainly in

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,118
sweet potato um so the main motivation

20
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,039
for many of the projects in the lab is

21
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,680
that there is a huge diversity of plant

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
metabolites and that is because of the

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,720
complexity of the underlying metabolic

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,759
pathways and many of these are not

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,599
completely characterized or the

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,079
regulation is poorly understood um now

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,839
what are some of the challenges for this

28
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:25,239
pathway Discovery one is that on now we

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,478
can sequence any genome does this work

30
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:31,759
yep uh we can sequence any genome U even

31
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,239
poly genomes it's easier to sequence

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,040
than before but Gene functions in most

33
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,719
of these genomes are very poorly defined

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,000
there are no if you do an RNA seek or a

35
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,158
qtl analysis you in each qtl or an RNA

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,879
seek data you see hundreds of genes

37
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,479
dozens of genes and but which of those

38
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,679
genes are really important for a given

39
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,118
function that's not clearly understood

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,240
because you don't know the functions

41
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,039
very well especially in non-mod

42
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,679
organisms but there aren't a lot of

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,239
genetic resources

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,920
available one one of the typee of genes

45
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,519
that are affected by these are enzyme

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,199
families uh because metabolic enzymes

47
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,079
because they're part of large enzyme

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,318
families uh the functional inference is

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,280
difficult here because uh across large

50
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,359
evolutionary distances the sequences

51
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,120
change they evolve so you can't take

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,640
something from arabidopsis and try and

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,719
predict the function in some other

54
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,119
species so this is an illustration of

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,598
that if you have a large family in which

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,200
only two genes are characterized

57
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,839
arabidopsis and rice you want to predict

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,159
the function of a tomato orthologue you

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,360
can't predict that because you know lot

60
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,759
of duplications and speciations have

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,879
occurred along the way uh this there's

62
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,039
also allic Divergence and promiscuity

63
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,560
that's present in enzyme families and

64
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,878
that leads to missing annotations

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,959
incomplete annotations or wrong

66
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,439
annotations this is a very prevalent

67
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,560
problem in all sequence genomes even in

68
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,959
arabidopsis that's what we are trying to

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,080
address our model family is this family

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,000
called the bhds transfer family which

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,480
does a simple reaction uh I won't go

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,719
into all the biochemical details but uh

73
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,439
this family has expanded quite a bit in

74
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,680
plants so we in algal species you see

75
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,639
just uh one to three copies but in dorts

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,519
monocots you see dozens to hundreds of

77
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,679
copies in each genome uh but these are

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,560
poorly annotated and tomato these are

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,120
all the some of the genes some of the

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,920
bhds and only 12 out of these bhds are

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,120
substrate class annotations the rest are

82
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,399
just characterized as hxxd type A

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,438
transferases and that's not I mean these

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
are doing something they are not just a

85
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:36,479
transferases what are they exactly doing

86
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,878
what substrates do they use uh that's

87
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,238
unknown so what we reason is that if we

88
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,239
increase the density of annotated

89
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,759
functions across the tree then we can

90
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,280
probably predict the Tomato orthol

91
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,639
better um and it's not that only

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,318
arabidopsis and rice have been

93
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,958
characterized a lot of them have been

94
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,318
characterized but they are in papers

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,920
they are not in databases and so we

96
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,639
can't really find them uh over the last

97
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,919
few years we spent uh we have uh several

98
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,318
Publications on this on this particular

99
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:09,639
family the most recent being uh just in

100
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,280
uh know early this year uh on on this

101
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,798
tool that we developed called Fun fetch

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,759
or the workflow uh in this tool

103
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,879
essentially our workflow what we did was

104
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,639
we use chat GPT uh or GPT the brains

105
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,360
behind chat GPT to read papers instead

106
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,560
of doing it ourselves and uh it's a

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,160
whole workflow where we screen 27,000

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,319
abstracts from PubMed uh read thousands

109
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,639
of papers and extracted a bunch of

110
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,680
activities uh from there and removed

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,079
hallucinations and and did all fun stuff

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,918
um which took several months uh what

113
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,680
that resulted in is an increase in the

114
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,639
density of the enzyme functions and I

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,240
won't go into all the details uh but uh

116
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,199
if you look at the existing annotation

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,240
in tomato there are only 12 bsgs out of

118
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,038
100 which have their functions

119
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,879
characterized um in our previous paper

120
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:04,038
in 2022 we did Manual curation of these

121
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,199
of bhds in from papers and that based on

122
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,639
the similarity after increasing the

123
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,840
density we can increase the number to 42

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,319
that's a huge jump but um after using uh

125
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,519
the compiling database using fun fetch

126
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,800
we can increase that number to 58 um out

127
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,599
of out of 100 so just by taking what has

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,439
already been done over the last three

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,520
decades we can increase the functions by

130
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,918
quite a bit and that's this is just an

131
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,439
example of bsgs we can do this for for

132
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:36,038
phenotypes we can do this for U Know

133
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,879
other sets of genes Etc to as long as we

134
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,719
can put it in orthologous groups and

135
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,199
analyze it in this way so right now we

136
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,400
are exploring the other applications of

137
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,199
this of this tool also sharing this data

138
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,638
with global databases we're

139
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
collaborating with unipro plant

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,439
metabolic Network Etc so people all over

141
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,800
the world will be able to use these you

142
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,319
know highly curated data sets once they

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,000
have they can they can uh they have

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,840
their set of candidates okay so in the

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,519
second project we are uh working a lot

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:10,638
on sweet potatoes um so sweet this uh

147
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,519
know I won't go into reasons why we are

148
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,759
working on sweet potatoes but they we

149
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,159
started seeing very interesting

150
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,038
phenotypes and we started growing them

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,120
in the field so these are two different

152
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,639
varieties that are started at two one we

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,000
grew in Albany near Albany and one in

154
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,038
Geneva uh started at the same time from

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,720
the same stock and you can see the huge

156
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,800
difference in the root size um and and

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
surprisingly the second year the order

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,000
was switched between the two locations

159
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,439
so or the sizes were switched and we

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,478
really don't know what exactly caused

161
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,120
this and that led to a whole set of

162
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:44,800
experiments that we are trying to still

163
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,160
figure out know what is causing this

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,759
difference um one of the reasons why

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,560
sweet potatoes are attractive in New

166
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,199
York state is because in the South where

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,839
they're grown there are lot of diseases

168
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,879
and pest problems but in New York uh

169
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,758
most of the cultivation is organic and

170
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,360
there's a a market for Dy and food food

171
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,840
colors health foods which can be tapped

172
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,960
into if we can grow sweet potatoes under

173
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,758
organic cultivation in New York

174
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,719
state so uh we have done this experiment

175
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,439
where we grew sweet potatoes under

176
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,000
different stresses we also supplemented

177
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,719
them with arbuscular micr fungi and it

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,478
looks like it had an effect uh in in

179
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,720
managing the the drought responses not

180
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,680
so much in regular water and high water

181
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,560
but we see improvements in in uh in leaf

182
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,598
quality as well as root length based on

183
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,720
if we inoculate them with amfs uh this

184
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:39,240
is result from just today morning 11:00

185
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,840
um where uh uh terar GR in the lab is

186
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,519
looking at uh again root growth under

187
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,839
water stress and under low water we can

188
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,799
see increased tuberization of the roots

189
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,878
and increased root length which is

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
expected but increased tuberization is a

191
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
bit surprising which indicates that the

192
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,878
drought response in the tuberization

193
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,400
pathways are overlapping and we would

194
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,960
want to figure out what's happening

195
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,719
exactly to make the sweet po cultivation

196
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,959
more resilient to water stress um

197
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,360
another aspect we are looking into is

198
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,198
these class of compounds called resin

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
glycosides which provide defense against

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,319
nematodes fungi in sweet potato roots

201
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,800
and many other concious species they are

202
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,039
important for medicinal properties too

203
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,280
we're trying to figure out their

204
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,519
biosynthetic Pathways and the diversity

205
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,559
in different suet po cultivar so we can

206
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:31,158
breed for more resilient uh pathogen

207
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,918
resistant and Neato resent sors okay

208
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:37,399
that's it lot of people have contributed

209
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,399
to our research and can take any

210
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,240
questions yeah what

211
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,759
is

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,919
metab what is a metabolite we when we

213
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:52,080
say metaboli it is basically something

214
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,360
that's uh it's a small molecule that we

215
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,040
are talking about so proteins uh we

216
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,200
don't consider them as metabolites in in

217
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,319
this uh proteins are not not detected

218
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,399
easily using liquid chrom the the the

219
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,959
type of lcms that we use um and so they

220
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:14,839
are basically ignored from our analysis

221
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:17,359
so most of our scans are less than 2,000

222
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,399
Daltons not

223
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,200
secondary so secondary primary both all

224
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,039
kinds of metabolites but as long as

225
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,120
they're smaller than 200,000 Daltons is

226
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,039
what we uh end up

227
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,639
seeing yep

228
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,480
um your bioinformatics pipeline what is

229
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,799
the is it plant specific what's the

230
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,519
extent of that yeah uh it is plant

231
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,319
specific right now and it's uh easy yeah

232
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,399
we we do use taxonomy as a filter for

233
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,680
removing the hallucinations that we see

234
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,240
in fact know we can see the paper is

235
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:55,278
from a plant the plant like barley or

236
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,759
oat but uh the GPT algorithm is pulling

237
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,360
out um human enzymes or rat enzymes and

238
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,879
the compounds at it associated with like

239
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,480
testosterone which are obviously not

240
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,720
present in barley um so there is

241
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,879
hallucinations that it's getting from uh

242
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,879
its training data drug bank and other

243
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,320
sources the water stress yes what are

244
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,000
the other atic

245
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,760
stresses uh so the question is when we

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,639
are looking at Water stress what other

247
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,799
abiotic stresses we're looking into

248
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,199
right now uh only what uh actually cold

249
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,919
stress is is one for sweet potato

250
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,200
because what we want to do with amfs is

251
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:40,360
see if we can increase the uh the sweet

252
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,000
potato when they transplanted into the

253
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,959
soils they they transplanted in June and

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,480
the growth period is still early October

255
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,518
while in the South it goes from end of

256
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,839
April to October so if we can increase

257
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,639
it by 152 days even and make the

258
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,680
potatoes more resilient to uh late Frost

259
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,159
then uh we we could in increase the

260
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,000
cultivation time so um old stress is one

261
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,360
of

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,360
them so you didn't tell us what you do

263
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,440
for fun but you're not doing

264
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:18,720
research um uh I watch a lot of

265
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,839
TV and uh I like to travel so next week

266
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm going to Grand Canyon and Sedona and

267
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,920
uh doing some fun things nice okay go

268
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,440
thank

269
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:33,199
you thank you and and thanks for having

270
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,519
me here today um so to the to the prompt

271
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,600
uh I'm Kelly Robbins I was born and

272
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,440
raised in Knoxville

273
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,440
Tennessee uh after I got my PhD I went

274
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,839
into industry for eight years and then I

275
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,360
came here to Cornell in 2015 as a senior

276
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,440
research associate and then switched

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,759
over to 10e track position in in

278
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,160
2017 um where I had kids I enjoyed uh

279
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,039
playing hockey and golf um now that I

280
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:03,319
have kids my pastimes are primarily

281
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,519
gymnastics ballet playing with dolls and

282
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,879
watching

283
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,078
cartoons all right so uh the robins lab

284
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,958
so just just at a high level right so we

285
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,198
apply quantitative genetics genomics and

286
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,039
computational science with this primary

287
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,958
focus on improving the efficiency of of

288
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,078
crop breeding programs and increasing

289
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,879
our understanding of of of complex

290
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,559
traits and I'll I I'll talk you know

291
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,278
kind of about the work we do at a at a

292
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,719
bit of a high level in in this

293
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,600
presentation right so my my training is

294
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,959
is Prim primarily in in statistics and

295
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,360
Mathematics and and modeling um and and

296
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,319
I do love doing the modeling um but but

297
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,039
what I really enjoy and the reason why I

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
I kind of identify as a as a plant

299
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:45,639
breeder even though I don't really spend

300
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,719
much time in a in a field or with with

301
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:53,159
clients for that matter is is is because

302
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,160
I I really enjoy uh working with

303
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,919
breeding programs to figure out how we

304
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,719
can actually Implement Advanced modeling

305
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,360
techniques and new technologies to to

306
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,160
improve the efficiency of of breeding

307
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,000
programs and so you know these are

308
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,399
collaborations where you know generally

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,078
I'm working with breeding programs and

310
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,679
and you know they they always start with

311
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,399
with these discussions and and there's

312
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,479
two really kind of key components that

313
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,198
go into this one is is what I call the

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,879
breeding strategy which is you know what

315
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,000
is it we we're predicting and how do we

316
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,600
use those predictions within the context

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,240
of of genetic Improvement program right

318
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,800
and then the the prediction strategy

319
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,120
which is more on on the modeling side

320
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,639
which is you know what data whatch

321
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,679
Technologies and what you know sort of

322
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
mathematical statistical machine

323
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,599
learning meth methodologies we're

324
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
actually going to use to make the

325
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,240
predictions and these two things kind of

326
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,600
feed off each other right so you have to

327
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,879
you have to really have a good sense of

328
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,959
of both of them to to understand um so

329
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,120
uh this is just uh you know kind of uh

330
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,278
from a perspectives article we we we

331
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,278
published I guess it was a while ago now

332
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:56,679
right where where you know you know

333
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,519
based off of both my experience in

334
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,239
Industry working with kind of like these

335
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,560
these really large breeding programs and

336
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,879
a multinational and then you know the

337
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,078
the the sort of contrasting experience

338
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,679
that we had had working with you know

339
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,638
public sector breeding programs which

340
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,638
tend to be a little bit smaller um

341
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,360
working with a lot more diverse crops is

342
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,600
is kind of you know looking at you know

343
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,278
how do we take what I what I might call

344
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,759
like a traditional breeding program and

345
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,439
move it into a a a much more of a

346
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,879
data-driven highly optimized and

347
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,560
efficient breeding process to to um to

348
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,480
implement genetic gain and so we had

349
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,119
sort of sort of you know broken it up

350
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,839
into these phases and we really work

351
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,679
across all of these phases right so we

352
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,240
do a lot of work on on the informatic

353
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:42,000
side which is you know to when you're

354
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,759
working with the breeding program right

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,159
um just giving them a model that's

356
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,000
that's really accurate isn't going to do

357
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,240
anything right like it has to be put

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,799
into operation right breeding programs

359
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,159
have lots of constraints in terms of

360
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,439
time in terms of you know the expertise

361
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,319
they may have available within the

362
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,839
program so we do a lot of work on sort

363
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,360
of partnering with bringing programs to

364
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,199
say okay what what do we need to provide

365
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,720
you in terms of computational resources

366
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:07,679
in terms of software to be able to

367
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,320
actually implement the stuff that we're

368
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,799
doing um we work with them to to look at

369
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,160
you know what their actual breeding

370
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,000
pipeline looks like as it is and how we

371
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,039
might have to change or reoptimize that

372
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,039
pipeline to take the best advantage of

373
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,679
of new technologies and then um you know

374
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,919
for really Advanced breeding programs

375
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,399
this idea of of being able to you know

376
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,719
so like response to selection is is is

377
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,240
going to be a function of you know the

378
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,839
genetic architecture of the trait

379
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,120
obviously but also you know how quickly

380
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,680
you can make decisions and how

381
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,078
accurately you can make decisions right

382
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,318
and so we do a lot of work on on given

383
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:46,359
what we can do you know how can we make

384
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:50,399
decisions as accurately and as rapidly

385
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,000
as possible within a breeding program um

386
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,958
right and and you know one of the sort

387
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,600
of the grand challenges that we have

388
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,239
right now and and and why it's a a good

389
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,278
time to be a quantitative genetic is is

390
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,240
is that um you know a traditional

391
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,198
breeding program sort of operates under

392
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,039
this this kind of Paradigm where you you

393
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,958
generate new lines you test them across

394
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,759
a sampling of the environments that you

395
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,679
expect to see you make decisions based

396
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
off of performance you get uh you know

397
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,838
from that that sampling of environments

398
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,120
and then you know based off that you

399
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,399
make decisions on what crosses you're

400
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,198
going to make which lines you're

401
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:30,839
actually GNA um uh release right and so

402
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,679
there is this kind of concept of of like

403
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,519
what we might call you know sort of

404
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,439
overall yield but also this idea of

405
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,078
yield stability right which is you know

406
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,680
an environment is not a fixed thing it's

407
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,838
it's a it's a random sampling from year

408
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,039
to year you're G to get something a

409
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,319
little bit different right and and so

410
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,879
you know there they're you know breeders

411
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:50,159
would call them like racehorse versus

412
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,639
Workhorse kind of varieties right so a

413
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,159
Workhorse variety would be kind of

414
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,600
represented by those blue dots that' be

415
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,039
a line that that isn't great but it

416
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,639
seems to have fairly consistent

417
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,838
performance AC across a range of

418
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,759
environments what they might call a

419
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,640
racehorse envir uh hybrid would be or

420
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,720
variety would be one that when you put

421
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,640
it in really good conditions man it just

422
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,360
it does great but if you soon as it

423
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
starts getting stressed it kind of falls

424
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,198
apart right and and depending on what

425
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,838
the target environmental regions are

426
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,519
maybe the racehorse is what you want

427
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,038
right or maybe the Workhorse is what you

428
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,959
want I mean ideally what you'd want is

429
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:27,078
is a line that just yields you know

430
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,318
across the board I'm not sure that that

431
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,519
that's really possible if you really

432
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,599
think about how how GB works right um

433
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,038
and and so it's something that's always

434
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,399
been important but but it's starting to

435
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:38,038
become even more important and and I you

436
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,798
know I work with with a lot of breeding

437
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:43,240
programs and and you know when when you

438
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,679
talk with them you know it's not

439
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,880
necessarily the fact that we expect to

440
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,759
see mean shifts in environments that

441
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,120
concern breeders they're actually quite

442
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,960
just using the methods they use they're

443
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,158
they're quite uh capable of dealing with

444
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,759
that but it it's it's the fact that you

445
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,760
know as environment change you know as

446
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,158
you know environments are going to

447
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,119
change in the future we're going to

448
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,159
start to see higher frequencies of the

449
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,759
more extreme environments right and so

450
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,520
this idea of of finding lines that

451
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,359
perform well in the most common

452
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,000
environments even if they're not so

453
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,479
great in the very rare extreme

454
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,640
environments is no longer going to be

455
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
the Paradigm we work in we need to have

456
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,240
varieties that that are capable of of

457
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,759
maintaining good yield under you know I

458
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,720
don't know what a normal environment is

459
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,960
these days in a lot of places right but

460
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,720
but also is not going to fall apart as

461
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,360
as you hit some of these extremes right

462
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,679
and so that's just sort of the kind of

463
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,639
setup at a at a high level sort of you

464
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,400
know how we operate right so um so so we

465
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,440
can we can kind of think about what I

466
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,519
would call prediction scenarios right so

467
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,038
that's what I do I I take data and I

468
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,200
kind of predict what's or I make

469
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:51,599
inference about what's going to happen

470
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,440
um in the future right so so a

471
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,038
traditional breeding program typically

472
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,120
operates in this oh wait this is

473
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,720
extended desktop right typically

474
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,239
operates in this known by known right so

475
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,440
so in a traditional breeding program you

476
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,519
generate a lot of new lines you you put

477
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,558
them out into what we call

478
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,240
multi-environmental trials we see you

479
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,240
see how they perform right from uh it's

480
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,919
quite effective right as long as you

481
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,558
have a big enough program and you can

482
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,360
sample enough environments to be

483
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,038
representative sample it's quite

484
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,599
powerful from a modeling standpoint it's

485
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,558
it's a little bit boring right because

486
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,240
it's it's relatively straightforward

487
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:27,720
modeling just using simple linear models

488
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,759
works for that right um there's a

489
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:36,159
another scenario right right which is um

490
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:37,640
the scenario right that um uh is what we

491
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,360
would probably call genomic selection

492
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,679
right and genomic selection you know

493
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,240
with this idea of trying to make

494
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,720
decisions faster to get better gain this

495
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,558
is where you're you're you have some

496
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,960
known set of Target environments that

497
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,079
are characterized and you're trying to

498
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,798
predict these you know performance in

499
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:58,158
these unknown sets of environments right

500
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,359
um I do a lot of work in in

501
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,400
international a right and so a common

502
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,839
scenario you have right is that um Eco

503
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,840
regions cultural preferences consumer

504
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:11,119
preferences don't tend to fit nicely

505
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,639
within you know national state Regional

506
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,119
borders right and so oftentimes we'll

507
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,200
have a region right where there's

508
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,879
multiple National breeding programs

509
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,000
right that that have some overlapping

510
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,080
objectives and the question is even

511
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,400
though they have a mandate to only work

512
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,879
within their their borders right like

513
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,320
sometimes it's more efficient to be able

514
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
to exchange germ plasm across Ross those

515
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,918
programs and so we work with these

516
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,678
programs to understand what their germ

517
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,960
plasm pools are understand you know how

518
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,000
much GB there is and and work with them

519
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,798
to sort of design optimal breeding

520
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,440
strategies that allow them to very

521
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,720
strategically share germ plasm between

522
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,120
programs to maximize genetic gain and

523
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,839
then of course there's there's sort of

524
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,719
like the Holy Grail I guess of of

525
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,959
quantitative genetics right and that's

526
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,038
really sort of getting at some of these

527
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,960
climate challenges which is you know it

528
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,000
takes you know 10 to 20 years to release

529
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,679
a variety right if we want to be

530
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,200
breeding for varieties that are going to

531
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,600
be doing really well 10 to 20 years from

532
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,919
now right we we have to start being able

533
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,279
to predict how new germ plasm that we're

534
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,440
making that maybe we haven't even seen

535
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,440
in the field is going to perform across

536
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,120
a range of environments that we might

537
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,558
forecast to be in the future and that

538
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:20,239
gets into sort of predicting um unknown

539
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:24,079
germplasm and unknown environments and

540
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,240
so um had some results here kind of out

541
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,879
of context I just take my word for it

542
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
we've been reasonably successful in

543
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,600
doing some of these things right and uh

544
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,038
with that I think I'm about all time so

545
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,678
I'll just say one last thing um we do do

546
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:37,960
a lot of work on developing these types

547
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,159
of comp computational tools to to get

548
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,640
adoption of what we do all right

549
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,960
thanks so I have a question so you're

550
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,000
you're in the business of predicting the

551
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,960
future right so if you look at the

552
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,359
trajectories of the public sector and

553
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,400
private sector breeding

554
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,199
programs how how do you think this going

555
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,360
to play out going forward do you think

556
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,679
there going to be increased interaction

557
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,479
or there always be distinct space what's

558
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,200
going to what was the future hope for us

559
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,000
I think I I think there's always going

560
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,400
to be a distinct space right because on

561
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,720
on the commercial side right it's it's

562
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,600
you know at the end of the day you have

563
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,159
to be profitable all right and there's

564
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,678
certain crops in certain markets where

565
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,080
you can be very profitable right I mean

566
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,559
even within a company right like you

567
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:25,000
know when I worked for a

568
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,079
company worked across a lot of crops

569
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,319
right like like I think 80% of

570
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,519
everything went to maze right and then

571
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,798
soly being canola kind of got like the

572
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,400
next tier leftovers and then you know

573
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,200
there was you know some cotton out there

574
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,559
somewhere that you know i' never even

575
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,519
worked with right but when you talk

576
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:45,240
about staple food crops um and and you

577
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:46,918
talk about crops like so so so rice and

578
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,720
wheat for example right where there's

579
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,520
not necessarily like these great you

580
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,919
know value capture mechanisms right like

581
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,599
I think those are going to continue for

582
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,799
the foreseeable future to be dominated

583
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:02,359
by the public sector yeah

584
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:05,240
yeah so uh another question about uh

585
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:08,319
reading for resent trade so when we have

586
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,640
the Q gas they tend to find these high

587
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,558
effect size loai which cause a big

588
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,278
change in the phenotype but the

589
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,558
phenotype itself is affected by a lot of

590
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:19,079
small size

591
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:22,639
Bai and I'm wondering how how relevant

592
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:25,319
are these small small effect size Losi

593
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,840
uh in breeding first of all and second

594
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,439
do you think they might have an

595
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,439
application in

596
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,278
extremes you summarize that yeah so so

597
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,798
the the question is um you know this

598
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:43,278
this idea of um you know small effect

599
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,879
Losi versus large effect Loi um you know

600
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,720
how important are the the small effect

601
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,640
Loi for for many traits it's all small

602
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,360
effect Losi right so so a lot of

603
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,038
quantitative genetics is built off of

604
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,240
what we call the infinitesimal model

605
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,359
right which is this assumption that

606
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,558
there's an infinitely large number of

607
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,199
genes with infinitely small effects and

608
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,720
it's really just the sum total of all

609
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,919
those things right so so even if you

610
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,319
have a large effect qtl with a lot of

611
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,960
smaller effects right the sum total of

612
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,879
all those smaller effects can still be

613
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,240
quite big even if the individual effects

614
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,679
are not right and so in a case where we

615
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,278
might have some moderate to large

616
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,720
effects and a lot of small effects

617
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,240
essentially what you do is is you would

618
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,120
apply marker assisted selection to try

619
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,558
and fix the large effects and then you

620
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,599
would use these more quantitative

621
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,079
measurements to then push the more

622
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,119
quantitative Trace but when you start to

623
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:35,599
get into to a lot of the more complex

624
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,918
traits um you know effects large the

625
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,038
moderate effects that can be very

626
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,000
context specific they can be background

627
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,440
specific right and so you do end up

628
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,079
focusing a lot of work on the on the

629
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,798
smaller effects and that's um as a Quant

630
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,960
Genesis that's primarily where I I work

631
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,519
actually thank you Josh and good

632
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,519
afternoon

633
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,079
everyone uh as far as my introduction uh

634
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,918
my name is viin Kumar I'm a

635
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:04,240
a faculty member with soil and crop

636
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,399
Sciences uh been here for two years with

637
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
Corell I actually finished two years

638
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:13,278
this week uh before Cornell I was at

639
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,960
Kansas State as a faculty member um and

640
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,159
uh my appointment is a research and

641
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,720
extensions uh split half and half so I

642
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,000
work a lot of work with the producers uh

643
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,278
on daily

644
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,359
bases my program I'm just GNA just a

645
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:30,440
disclaimer I don't have a lot of data

646
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,038
but just going to give you an

647
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,919
overview of the things we are doing uh

648
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,720
in my program as well as the education

649
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,720
we are doing with the

650
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,399
stakeholders

651
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:44,759
uh as I said it's a weed SCI program so

652
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,639
we are working with the Weeds on

653
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:50,798
wandered plants uh we are uh working on

654
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,480
new weed species that has arrived in the

655
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,558
New York State and two I have listed

656
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,200
here uh Palmer and water Hamp those are

657
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,158
two Pig weeds uh the first two picture

658
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,278
you see the Palmer Rand these were

659
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:07,679
pictures taken last year uh new arrival

660
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:11,278
new reports from Yates and uh Ontario

661
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,759
County the person you see is Mike stard

662
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:17,000
he's our uh extension leader from

663
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,278
Western New York who basically identifi

664
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,558
those fields and helped us to collect

665
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,278
some of these palmeran palmeran and

666
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:27,678
waterham those are two most Troublesome

667
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:30,480
weeds across the country uh and they are

668
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,159
new to us so we are trying to critize

669
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,038
and educating our stakeholders what

670
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:39,840
those are how they look like and what we

671
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:43,079
can do to manage those two Pig weeds uh

672
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,839
very very uh fast breading in the state

673
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,960
we have almost uh 21 different counties

674
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,918
where water Hamp has been reported in

675
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,679
the state and we have six different

676
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,559
counties where palaram has been reported

677
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,080
uh from New York state so it's it's a

678
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,079
it's a problem

679
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,079
uh as I said we are collecting these uh

680
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,319
population and uh part of my program is

681
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,759
looking at the herbicide resistance in

682
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,158
these different wheat species uh this is

683
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,960
a Statewide survey been sponsored by New

684
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,720
York corn and soybean Growers as well as

685
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,919
uh The cornal Cooperative uh you know a

686
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,679
experiment station hatch dollars

687
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,038
supporting this work the idea behind the

688
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,120
screening work is to look for uh the

689
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,759
distributions and the frequency of

690
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,599
resistance population across the state

691
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,839
and kind of come up with the map uh for

692
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:37,719
the state and educate our producers

693
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,558
where these resistant populations are

694
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,880
and what we can do to

695
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,798
manage the pictures I have put there uh

696
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,840
these are dose response studies we have

697
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:51,798
done on water hemp as well as on anual R

698
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:56,319
grass uh some of you probably know anual

699
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:58,639
R grass is uh is grown for cover crops

700
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:02,158
so we have some annual Ry grass

701
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,320
uh showing resistance to glyphosate uh

702
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,440
these are new reports in the state

703
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,519
similarly for waterand we have uh you

704
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,038
know 8 to 12 fold resistance uh recently

705
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,519
found in our New York population the

706
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,398
picture you see here on on my side is my

707
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,839
graduate student holding a glyphosate

708
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,798
resistant water hemp in a grower field

709
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,519
in sanica county and you can see the

710
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,599
growth and Seed production it's going to

711
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,759
have and this grower has been has been

712
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,798
uh

713
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:32,919
uh facing the challenge of this species

714
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,759
over the last five six years Brian you

715
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,519
have worked on this uh it's it's it's

716
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,240
still a lot of seed bank in in these

717
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,960
fields with the grower

718
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,319
field other PES of interest uh as I said

719
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Palmer waterham we are also testing

720
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:52,158
horse weeds uh common rag weed wet Leaf

721
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,759
some grasses like Fox taals so this is

722
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,120
kind of long-term project we have

723
00:28:53,759 --> 00:29:00,879
initiated and hoping to uh get some uh

724
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,199
better look uh across the state over the

725
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,320
next five six

726
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,000
years just some pictures showing some

727
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,359
annual R graph these are Growers

728
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,720
pictures uh Growers field where we got

729
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,558
these pictures uh they were trying to

730
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,278
terminate these anual Rass with rounda

731
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,918
with glyphosate and were not successful

732
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,558
so we are testing these and we have

733
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,559
found a pretty high level resistance in

734
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,119
these uh anal R grass so trying to

735
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,278
educate them if they're growing these

736
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:30,359
cover crops how to handle how to manage

737
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:34,079
and how to terminate and how to get

738
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:37,839
proactive to tackle these

739
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:40,038
plans uh just I said we are not just

740
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:43,480
identifying problems for producer but

741
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:45,480
also developing Solutions uh we are part

742
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,319
of my program is looking at alternative

743
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,798
herbicide programs what they can use

744
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,278
especially conventional Growers uh we

745
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,158
are testing and doing a lot of on Farm

746
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:57,038
trials with the producers uh looking for

747
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,360
different pre and post applied

748
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,440
herbicides different premixes different

749
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:05,759
Tech mixes they can use to control these

750
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,399
glyphosate resistant uh weed population

751
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,278
just some pictures I'm not showing a lot

752
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:13,759
of data here but this is a PhD student

753
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,759
who is involved in in these

754
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,158
work chemical based wheed control is is

755
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,918
common and that's what I just showed but

756
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,399
how about uh integrated wheed management

757
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,640
we are looking some Innovative tools uh

758
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:30,038
how we can integrate in in our field

759
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,840
crop or field croing systems in the

760
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,839
state and we are testing some of the new

761
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:38,839
tools like harvest wheat seed control

762
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:41,879
the picture you see here um the combine

763
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,439
having a readyop uh seed impact mill on

764
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,278
the back of the combine which is

765
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,880
basically destroy the wheat seeds when

766
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:51,119
you use it at the time of a crop Harvest

767
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,278
this is a novel concept been adopted in

768
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:57,359
Western Australia in wheat production

769
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:59,398
system but not much data in in us so the

770
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,158
unit we have and we are trying to test

771
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:06,319
here in the New York other tools we are

772
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,159
looking at inter moing uh most uh common

773
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,000
tool or favorite tool for organic

774
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,480
producers but we are also looking for

775
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,638
conventional producer if they can use

776
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,880
these tools uh such as uh interro moing

777
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,439
and and suppress or control some of

778
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,919
those weed

779
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,720
population similarly uh electrical

780
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,639
weeding uh we have been doing this work

781
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,480
in collaboration with Dr Matt Ryan group

782
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,959
with soil and crop Sciences looking at

783
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,399
the electrocutions shocking these weeds

784
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,639
uh how we how much weed supression we

785
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:43,359
can get with the electric weer so these

786
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:45,798
tools we are checking side by side uh in

787
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,839
comparison to our herbicide effective

788
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,519
herbicide options like Liberty and list

789
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,240
one in this study we are comparing these

790
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,759
side by-side comparisons as well as like

791
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,480
a multi tactic layers having those tools

792
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,440
together throughout the season and what

793
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,798
kind of

794
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,200
impact we see on the seed bank over the

795
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,200
over the

796
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,880
years other aspects we are looking in in

797
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,079
our in my program is uh integrating uh

798
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,039
other tools as I said uh cover crops and

799
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,879
prison egg tools we are trying to

800
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:21,119
develop digital Technologies and tools

801
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,320
that can be used for site specific or

802
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,798
Target weat

803
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,480
control uh we have been partnering with

804
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:31,398
USDA ARS from Maryland looking at

805
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,440
developing the weed image database as

806
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:37,158
well as uh phenotyping for the

807
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,278
covercraft using 2DS and 3DS cameras so

808
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,360
the whole idea behind this project is to

809
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,359
come up with some decision sport tools

810
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,918
for scouting purpose so we are

811
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:50,000
developing these Technologies in

812
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,000
collaboration with the USDA ARS

813
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:58,199
folks I see Josh has standard stand

814
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:01,720
already so my last slide is uh just the

815
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,639
overall Vision um as I mentioned we are

816
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,919
working on you know identifying

817
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:08,439
resistance but we are also developing

818
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,278
integrated wheat management tools so the

819
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,519
whole vision of the program is to

820
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:14,519
integrate these tactics not just relying

821
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,120
on chemicals but looking at other

822
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,120
non-chemical tools novel tools like

823
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,558
mechanical tools as well as uh perison

824
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,000
act tools to come together or bring

825
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,918
together as a integrated approach

826
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,480
because we have knowledge about those

827
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,519
different tactics stand alone but how

828
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,278
about all together what kind of

829
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,120
information we can extract that can be

830
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:38,200
used to develop some decision support

831
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,839
tools to help producers to make those

832
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,720
decisions for weed

833
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,079
control and that's all I have a lot of

834
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,038
folks to acknowledge here funding

835
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:50,638
agencies as well as collaborators and

836
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:51,440
colleagues from Cornell as well as uh

837
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,599
other

838
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,600
institutes thank

839
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,558
you Brian yeah so uh bmer amth is is

840
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,480
still there is only on a handful of

841
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:05,759
farms in New York do you think we still

842
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,760
have a chance to maybe keep it out of

843
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:12,039
New York keep it um in these other

844
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,399
states with scouting and maybe with

845
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:16,960
collaboration with the state state

846
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,319
governments or County governments yeah

847
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,519
as I said um these are new species

848
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,039
Palmer is arrived like first report was

849
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,719
2019 and now we have six different

850
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,358
counties and these are just handful of

851
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,118
fields uh I think there are chance and

852
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,598
uh as per my knowledge like other states

853
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:38,200
we are in the same boat uh like no deota

854
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:41,320
is doing that they are putting Palmer is

855
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:43,678
a noxious species and the state has come

856
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,119
together as a community approach to

857
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,960
eradicated we can do it uh but how

858
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,159
serious we are we are still trying to

859
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,800
educate producers that how serious this

860
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,559
problem is uh palaram is one of the

861
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,480
worst wheat species if you don't know

862
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,358
palaram you don't know you don't know

863
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,079
wheat science basically twoth third of

864
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,000
the literature in wheat science we Tech

865
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:09,039
is on palar basically so that's that's

866
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,159
the that tells the seriousness but to to

867
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,519
your question I think there are chances

868
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:17,279
and it needs a community approach not

869
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:20,400
only from agencies and institutes but

870
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,240
also help from the stakeholders how they

871
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,680
come together and that's what we are

872
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,358
doing in over the winters educating them

873
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:30,239
what it looks like where we see this

874
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:33,039
because as most of these producers I in

875
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:35,078
track they don't know what is this um

876
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,000
that's that's the basic knowledge Gap

877
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,280
there but is it's possible but we have

878
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,679
to be proa actually more reactive now

879
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,040
than proactive

880
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:49,838
yep anything else so for this audience

881
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:52,599
do you ever see pathogens of some and

882
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,920
pathogens you mean biological control do

883
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,920
you ever see in

884
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:03,318
the facing the Leeds uh is a problem for

885
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,720
them propagating to prop well uh I don't

886
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:07,239
know on the Palmer but yeah diseases are

887
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:10,159
there been doing these extension

888
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:13,078
meetings with our pathologist uh retired

889
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:16,559
pathologist Gary uh there are new things

890
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,160
coming showing uh across the state and

891
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,480
it's not only weeds or or diseases I I

892
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:24,440
would say this is is in general for the

893
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,800
past these are emerging challenges for

894
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,358
for our stakeholders and why it's

895
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,200
happening lot of things are happening uh

896
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,199
climate is changing uh you know the

897
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:37,919
winters this winter is pretty cold but

898
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:41,279
overall last few few years the winter

899
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,559
was warmer uh things are moving a lot of

900
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,560
movement from across the state from

901
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,799
state to state and they are also

902
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:50,639
bringing some of these issues so I would

903
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,200
say there are a lot of emerging issues

904
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,920
emerging pest issues uh that needs to be

905
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,078
taken care of not from the state

906
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,200
standpoint but from Regional standpoint

907
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,960
like Northeast uh States

908
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:07,480
so thank you thank you and I love

909
