1
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,559
right now we're around 4 in to about

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,280
three so we're going to want to cut it 3

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,279
and 1/2 to 3

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,439
in when you're setting a deck you don't

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,519
want to surround the top of the deck

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,839
with grass you want to give yourself a

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,518
small gap for air flow so what we like

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,439
to do is we'll set the deck at its

9
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:29,439
highest setting and slowly move them

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,439
down in equal increments

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,119
so we've still got enough room where we

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,599
could probably come down one more Notch

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,119
without surrounding the blade and the

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,160
deck with

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,159
grass so equally bring them

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,640
down keep my foot out
