1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,320
University um yeah thanks yourself for

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,638
the words um so yeah today I'll be

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,400
talking about pre- and post Harvest

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,600
Management in apple focusing on a

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,079
Norwegian perspective um kind of giving

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,000
some insight into the fact that yes we

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,518
can grow apples in Norway and how we

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,599
grow them um so and there will be a

10
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:33,320
sufficient amount of um beautiful

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,359
pictures um to just show off a little

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:42,039
bit so just so you're

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:45,000
aware um this is like right outside my

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,160
office really or pretty close to yeah

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,119
it's in my

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,959
town it's pretty epic um so just a kind

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,159
of General brief overview I'll give a

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,439
overall background of a little bit about

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:03,238
Norway and my um Institute in general

20
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,118
and then um fruit growing in Norway um

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,319
tie it into explaining a little bit

22
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,159
about the climate of Norway and how that

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,758
impacts growing and then specifically

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,600
how it impacts post Harvest um certain

25
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,478
disorders since that's what I focus on

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,959
um and then tying in some new cultivars

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,640
that we've just had and how that impacts

28
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,599
post Harvest research how that impacts

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,478
my research and leading that into my PhD

30
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,118
and essentially why am I even at

31
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,239
Cornell um

32
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,759
so I was going to talk about me but

33
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,280
Yousef pretty much did that so I'm from

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,280
Maine I want that to be said I'm not

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Norwegian fullon

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,439
American went to undergrad here worked

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,320
for a couple years in Western New York

38
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,559
and then decided I needed to learn how

39
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,959
to do research properly so I did a

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,000
master's also in Norway because I wanted

41
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,959
more cold and um more winter so I was

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,239
like let's go to Norway um and then I

43
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,559
found out they had fruit they had apples

44
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,919
and I decided to stay so I did my thesis

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,280
um at nibio The Institute that I work at

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:15,560
now um and now as part of my um position

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,239
as a scientist I am doing a PhD um in

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,159
partnership with nio my university in

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,159
Norway and now with Carnell as well so

50
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,239
that's kind of the overall

51
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:29,120
connection um so I don't I also don't

52
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,000
expect everyone to have a grasp of where

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,920
Norway is and why this is impactful but

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,639
basically Norway is like way up here way

55
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,000
at the tippity top it's about the same

56
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,958
I'm about the same latitude as ankorage

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,439
Alaska um but because of the Gulf Stream

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,560
we it's warmer than an Anchorage so we

59
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,479
can grow more things and we can grow

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,959
apples commercially whereas in Alaska

61
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,039
they couldn't necessarily so that's just

62
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,640
the general context of why why I can

63
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,878
even be working on apples in

64
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,158
Norway um

65
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:08,719
generally my Institute

66
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:10,719
is um it's kind of this combination of

67
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,759
extension

68
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,878
and

69
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:19,239
USDA and all this

70
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:22,518
different culminations of Applied um

71
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,400
agricultural research so it's a fairly

72
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,239
large Institute it's the 750 employees

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,640
over 15 different stations positioned in

74
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,120
different spots to focus on whatever

75
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,518
commodity is grown or produced there so

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,438
we have a lot of aquaculture up north

77
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,239
and Arctic

78
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:44,719
Sciences um we have a lot of grasslands

79
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,360
and Forestry in the middle and then the

80
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,840
Big Apple near me is my research station

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,159
which focuses just on

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,120
fruit um and as you can see Norway is

83
00:03:53,158 --> 00:04:00,158
super long um there's a lot of it's

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,759
really ragged Jagged coastline um

85
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,560
there's very little aable land only 3%

86
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,479
of the country can is aable so there's

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,640
some unique challenges just based on the

88
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,199
geography um if we zoom in on my station

89
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,000
so this is um these are some of our

90
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:20,959
Orchards this big um long

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,279
building right here is our office

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,399
building and then down here we have a

93
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,399
lab building with Windows facing over

94
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,120
the

95
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:33,120
Fjord um so our station has been around

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,439
for 7 5 years um it was um created to

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,240
support Fruit Growers in the region um

98
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,160
and we are right in the middle of one of

99
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,840
the largest growing regions for apples

100
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,439
in Norway um so it's a pretty strategic

101
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,279
placement um we are 10 researchers and

102
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,759
eight technicians that work with every

103
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,000
aspect of fruit research from cultivar

104
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,038
and root stock selection all the way

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,120
through post Harvest and CER production

106
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,000
um we have a lot of collaboration both

107
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,240
nationally and internationally with

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,079
business and researchers other

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,000
researchers and especially given the

110
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,478
scale of Norwegian fruit production I

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,199
think we have pretty good infrastructure

112
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,199
overall for free

113
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,478
research um if we dig more into Fruit

114
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,918
industry in Norway in general um here in

115
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,478
Norway we classify as fruit and berries

116
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:24,038
so fruit is like all tree fruit um so we

117
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,240
do work on berries a lot too because

118
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,519
there is a lot of berry growth growing

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,918
but that's a different station I don't

120
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:34,439
work with it at all so I'm just going to

121
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:36,439
talk on about tree fruit um so Norway

122
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,240
it's primarily Apple Plum Cherry and

123
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:43,199
pear it's pretty small acreage 4,000

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,519
Acres of Apple total but it's also a

125
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,199
small country with five million people

126
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,478
so it doesn't need to be a ton and

127
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,560
there's this other impact of the um

128
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,318
northern latitude obviously affecting

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,560
the growing season and where we can grow

130
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,439
the fruit so if we look at the southern

131
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,199
part of Norway which is the only part of

132
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,038
nor where it's warm enough to grow fruit

133
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,319
we have three major growing region

134
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:10,759
regions one right near Oslo

135
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,800
um one in Telemark right in the middle

136
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,080
here which if you ski is where telmark

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,240
skiing was

138
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:21,120
originated um on one on the west coast

139
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,400
um and I work right here so right in the

140
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,478
middle of this session section and if if

141
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:32,000
you notice on the map the Big connector

142
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:35,680
piece here is uh fjords or lakes bodies

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,399
of water so as this picture shows it's

144
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,160
you're gr right up to the fiord or the

145
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,959
lake because you really need to take

146
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,880
advantage of um the moderated climate

147
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,799
from the bodies of water to even be able

148
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,240
to grow

149
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,319
anything um but because it's all in

150
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,759
fjords fjords tend to be mountains that

151
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,240
go straight very steeply down into

152
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,919
water so that means we are often growing

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,160
un really Steep gradients and you're

154
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:06,639
growing wherever you can in whatever

155
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,680
amount of space you can right so this is

156
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,199
not uncommon where you see like a

157
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,560
hundred trees planted in between

158
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,000
somebody's house and another house um

159
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,879
because you're just using all the space

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,360
that you can possibly

161
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,479
get uh but given that I still think we

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,120
have a fairly modern production system

163
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,839
right we use normal trellis system um we

164
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,280
try to plant north south but that's

165
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,638
really directed by the slope if

166
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,559
sometimes you just have to plant however

167
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,960
you can plant it um and even with that

168
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,800
sometimes you can't get a tractor up it

169
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,038
so you have to use an ATV or we have

170
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,639
these special sleds with h treads on

171
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,839
them that can hold one bin of apples so

172
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,680
it gets

173
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:51,638
interesting um everything is planted on

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,759
M9 root stocks um we import all our

175
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,158
trees from the Netherlands for the most

176
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,038
part um so

177
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,199
that we also have been producing trees

178
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,478
in the city or apples in the same region

179
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,680
since the

180
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,800
1200s so obviously they haven't been on

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,639
M9

182
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,960
forever but the same areas have been

183
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,079
used for growing apples for 800 years so

184
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,359
the fact that we're all using the same

185
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,158
root stock is kind of fascinating to

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,800
me

187
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:22,120
um there are a few chemical thinners

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
used

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,280
um and it's mostly hand thinning or no

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,479
thinning there's a couple reasons for

191
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,679
this it's often too cold to use for

192
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:35,319
chemical thinners to be effective but

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,240
then it's also our largest our um the

194
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Apple that yeah our largest volume um

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,680
Apple often gets too large if you thin

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,640
it is what the Growers say so we then go

197
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,079
into biannual year but at least or B

198
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,278
annual bearing but at least you have

199
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,680
sellable

200
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:59,600
fruit uh we also have limited pesticides

201
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:02,719
especially cons uh compared to the US um

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,278
it's similar to in the rest of the EU um

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,120
but some pesticides there's just not

204
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,720
enough of a market of people who want

205
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,320
them so the companies don't want to

206
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,560
register them in

207
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Norway um what I do think is kind of

208
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,838
unique is that all our cherries are

209
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,399
grown in tunnels um to prevent rain

210
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,079
cracking so from June to July half our

211
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,159
fields are just covered in white plastic

212
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,319
um because there's so much rain that

213
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,919
it's easy for the cherries to crack so

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
to commercially produce cherries they

215
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,120
have to be under tunnels we don't use

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,839
reflective Fabric or tunnels or anything

217
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,720
or hail nets for anything else but for

218
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,640
Cherries we exclusively use tunnels is

219
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,879
that the single use plastic for That

220
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,439
season no we try to reuse it a couple

221
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,159
times the plastic uh usually lasts like

222
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,680
five to 10 years is it left on the whole

223
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,000
time or is it on and off no we we take

224
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,078
we take off the fabric in the winter or

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,919
a in August really so it's only a couple

226
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:02,199
months out of the year um

227
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,919
but and we obviously have it off for

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,920
pollination as

229
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:11,359
well um overall if we talk closer to

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,240
harvest um we produce about 20,000

231
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,039
metric tons of apples per

232
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,320
year um generally from small Orchards

233
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,639
and Family Farms again because we have

234
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,800
this long history sometimes they've been

235
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,360
in the same family for 600

236
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:27,599
years

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,879
um and it's mostly Co-op uh packing

238
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
houses where the grower like a

239
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,039
number of Growers deliver to the same um

240
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,039
packing house and own the packing house

241
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,879
um because of the small scale of farming

242
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,599
it's often part-time farming so they The

243
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,958
Growers will have another job on top of

244
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,159
farming as well which complicates

245
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,518
things and um as I guess I pre

246
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,919
previously mentioned there's a lot of

247
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,560
rain so it often means that we're

248
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,639
harvesting in the rain um in New York if

249
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,879
it rains one day you're like oh well

250
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,759
I'll wait until the next day when the

251
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,320
Apple's dry to pick if we did that in

252
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,799
September in Norway you would never pick

253
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,399
a single Apple because it rains every

254
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,639
single

255
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
day so it's just something that we have

256
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,278
to deal with you learn to love the rain

257
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,839
um and you know it affects the

258
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:17,600
apples uh in the past 30 years the

259
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,600
strategy for um Apple production has

260
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,800
been to sell it as fast as possible

261
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,440
basically get everything out before the

262
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,519
end uh the beginning of December um we

263
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,600
have taxes on imported apples until

264
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,120
December 1st so that's the only time

265
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,000
that Norwegian apples have historically

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,639
been competitive in the

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,600
market uh however Norway wants to be

268
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,919
more self- sustainable right now it is

269
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,839
currently one of the least self-

270
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,879
sustainable countries in the world uh

271
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,079
and fruit is one of the ways it can be

272
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,679
sustain it can be self- sustainable in

273
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:55,278
Fruit um at least in apples so there's a

274
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,799
bigger focus on trying to increase both

275
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,759
the quality during the current season

276
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,799
selling season of Norwegian apples and

277
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,078
extend the season so there's this uh

278
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,799
renowned or renewed interest in post

279
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:09,039
Harvest all of a sudden in

280
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,039
Norway at the same time there's also

281
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,198
Resurgence in The Cider industry it it

282
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,559
seems to me like a very similar Trend to

283
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,799
what's been happening in New York the

284
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,958
past 105 years with lots of onale on

285
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:23,000
Farm sales um lots of marketing lots of

286
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:27,518
like look at how lovely this product is

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,240
and it really is quite great um I it's

288
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,720
it's a similar style I think um to New

289
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,240
York's cider so it it's really helped

290
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,680
the industry a

291
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,519
lot but I said I'd talk specifically

292
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,278
about the weather so we'll go into that

293
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,159
and this is just the reminder again that

294
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,958
everything is due to the Gulf

295
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:53,559
Stream So I want to directly compare

296
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,759
itha and my region of Norway so for the

297
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:59,239
next few graphs um Norway will be in

298
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,799
green and Ithaca will be in purple so

299
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,440
the graph on the left is the average

300
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,359
temperature throughout the year and what

301
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,199
I think is interesting here is the high

302
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,560
temperature in Norway during the growing

303
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,919
season is about the same a couple

304
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,599
degrees warmer than the low temperature

305
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,319
in

306
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,879
itha so it just it never gets warm in

307
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,079
Norway the sun makes it feel warm but

308
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,759
degrees wise it never gets very warm so

309
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,838
obviously this impacts Growing Degree

310
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,000
Days so this is uh Growing Degree Days

311
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,920
based on a 10 degree scale and here here

312
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,278
Norway gets about half The Growing

313
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:39,198
Degree Days in a season as itha

314
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:42,240
gets that has a big impact on what we

315
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,399
can grow and this is right on a f too

316
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,639
right like the most optimal conditions

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,399
that you can get for growing in

318
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,839
Norway but one of the things everybody

319
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,839
knows about Norway if you know something

320
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,759
about Norway is the Midnight Sun the

321
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,560
long daylight hours and the long night

322
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,199
hours in the winter right so OB so if

323
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,198
there's so much light maybe that has an

324
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,439
impact on

325
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:09,439
um or it can help increase the

326
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,600
growing season even if the temperatures

327
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,560
are

328
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,120
low right and based on this graph on the

329
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,439
left which is the hours of daylight

330
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,198
there's four hours more Daylight during

331
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,120
most of the growing season in Norway

332
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,479
than in

333
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,600
itha but the graph on the right is the

334
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,680
incid incident radiation right so what

335
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,959
actually would hit the tree what you

336
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,919
know is is it is always lower in Norway

337
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,919
than in itha even though we have four

338
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:39,000
hours more Daylight per day in Norway

339
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,639
and the question there my question

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,078
immediately was why and that brings me

341
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,320
back to the oh it's always raining in

342
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,599
Norway and it really is so this is

343
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,079
average monthly

344
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,879
precipitation and what you can see is

345
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,519
the lowest month for precipitation in

346
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,519
Norway still has more precipitation than

347
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,759
the most you'll get in itha on average

348
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,679
so it really is always raining in Norway

349
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,720
uh and then during the Norwegian growing

350
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:10,719
season which is May 1st to September

351
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:13,959
30th itha gets 64 days of rain Norway

352
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,399
gets 104 So within a f Monon period we

353
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:19,159
have more than a month more days of

354
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,720
precipitation

355
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,319
so it really is always raining that has

356
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,839
to affect fruit

357
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,440
quality the plus side is we got awesome

358
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:33,839
rainbows and we get our own tanic Falls

359
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,800
look alike in my town so some

360
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,480
perks but we're focusing on apples so if

361
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:44,198
we then go into what apples we actually

362
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,600
grow uh we primarily have five different

363
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:50,159
cultivars um Aroma uh being this one

364
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,440
being the main variety uh but we also

365
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,559
grow Discovery red Gravenstein summered

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:00,040
and Ruben step um and we harvest in late

367
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:03,198
August through early October

368
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:06,639
these were completely unknown varieties

369
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,159
to me um before I moved to Norway and

370
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,079
there's a reason for that is that

371
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,399
they're all really summer varieties um

372
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:17,000
so for context we have a root stock

373
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,078
planting of galum that ripens in early

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,399
to mid

375
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,679
October in New York that's early to mid

376
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,639
September right so there's a month

377
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,000
difference um so it's really debatable

378
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,198
if we can even commercially grow Gayla

379
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,198
because it's on the edge of our growing

380
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,439
season so that's why we only have summer

381
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,519
varieties for the rest of the world and

382
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,160
why our varieties aren't necessarily

383
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,759
relevant historically to the rest of the

384
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,519
world uh as for

385
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,639
storage as stated our late season

386
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,480
storing varieties really aren't late

387
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,278
season they're mid-season at best

388
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,240
they're Gaya comparatives um Gaya can

389
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,600
generally be stored for like eight nine

390
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,039
months in optimal conditions and that's

391
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,199
what we're seeing with our storage

392
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,838
varieties as

393
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,918
well we also see because a lot of them

394
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,838
are early season varieties that they

395
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,400
lose firmness really quickly which is

396
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,798
typical of Summer varieties right you

397
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,798
pick them and they're soft if you look

398
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:20,279
at them uh and then to complicate

399
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,038
everything 1 mCP which is super common

400
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,240
ethylene inhibitor um right used in the

401
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:29,119
US commercially for 25 years was just

402
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,880
approved last year in Norway so we're

403
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:37,079
we're catching up at a rapid Pace to the

404
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,240
trends but it's we have some setbacks

405
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,439
that we've been working with and another

406
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,480
setback there is that we generally

407
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,600
harvest the fruit to write for long-term

408
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,839
storage um in part because of the

409
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,279
tradition of just sell the fruit as fast

410
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,240
as possible and you want the nicest

411
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,519
fruit if you're selling it right away so

412
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,400
you harvest it

413
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,519
late however we still pick or we still

414
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,600
sell the earliest pick fruit

415
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,639
first and that's the best fruit for

416
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,480
storage and then we end up storing the

417
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,159
late harvested fruit and that's the

418
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,440
worst fruit for storage so there needs

419
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,919
to be this like reconstruction of how

420
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,360
people think about how to store fruit um

421
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,038
we also have Harvest requirements that

422
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,359
aren't based on storage they're B based

423
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,798
on Direct sale and then we have this

424
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,519
really long Harvest window where Growers

425
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,918
are allowed to harvest for three to four

426
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,918
weeks um and we have the compounding

427
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,720
factor of gruit being in the

428
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,600
rain uh we also don't have internal

429
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,000
defect orders on packing lines we have

430
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,399
external ones so anything on the outside

431
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,038
we can sort out but if there's any

432
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,640
Browning or anything wrong inside we

433
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:48,480
can't see it so we don't actually know

434
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,480
how big of a problem internal disorders

435
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,839
are um and just really quickly to

436
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,679
emphasize the loss of firmness this is

437
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,759
in Aroma our main

438
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,080
cultivar um which is a midseason Variety

439
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,200
in Norway but according to the um Gan

440
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,839
bank or the

441
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,080
um yeah according to Geneva it ripens in

442
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:13,558
August August 21st 25th so pretty early

443
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,720
season um it this green line is the

444
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,480
requirement it needs to be at um at

445
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,960
packing for firmness

446
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,038
level um which is five kilos at Harvest

447
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,200
is usually six to seven and it loses

448
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,798
that by about six weeks of storage and

449
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,840
we're trying to store it for nine weeks

450
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:34,200
optimally with some firmness left during

451
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:38,199
shelf life which it clearly doesn't have

452
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,880
um so 1 mCP application and CI help but

453
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,319
we don't know for how long it it's never

454
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,720
going to be a six month storage variety

455
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,319
so complicate that bringing in the

456
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,000
disorders finally we also get soft scald

457
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:55,158
on it which is a really common chilling

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,519
injury common on honey crisp as well um

459
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,400
and we have ways to mitigate it that are

460
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:03,200
similar to how you mitigate in honey

461
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,480
crisp but in honey crisp you can

462
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,960
condition it for 10 day or seven days at

463
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,400
10 degrees um and then bring it down to

464
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,558
a cooler temperature but with Aroma it

465
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
gets soft so fast that you can't do it

466
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,879
so you have to debate if you want soft

467
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,558
scald or you want soft fruit and that's

468
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,280
kind of what we have to that's the

469
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,399
constant debate we have to work with um

470
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,879
and there is some evidence that growing

471
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,440
season seems so affect it and weather

472
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,240
seems so affect it but there's no

473
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,919
consistent

474
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,440
um indications of

475
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,400
that the other common disorder of honey

476
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,640
crisp so honey crisp it's often soft

477
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,960
scalled bitter pit um are talked about

478
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,880
so we do have bitter pit um but it's not

479
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,880
at significant levels you see it in also

480
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,919
in Aroma as you do soft scald and

481
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,159
calcium sprays generally work but um

482
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,360
it's hard to find scientific proof that

483
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,559
they work and there is variation between

484
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,519
Seasons which is what we see in New York

485
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,759
but it's just never at high amounts it's

486
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,879
like 5% is your like is a high year for

487
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,000
bitter pit so my question is I think

488
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,679
it's just not warm enough in Norway it

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,960
it could also be cul of our

490
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,480
susceptibility but I think it's just the

491
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,240
temperatures are never warm the calcium

492
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
can be distributed into the fruit for a

493
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,079
longer portion of the growing season

494
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,799
it's not as much of an issue that's my I

495
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,839
I don't have hard evidence for this but

496
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:32,200
this is just my general enal train of

497
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,240
thought and some positive to the cold

498
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,720
growing season

499
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,480
perhaps um we have also seen a rise in

500
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,759
other lenil disorders um that are not

501
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,440
bitter pit this is a variety we it's

502
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,519
hard to decide what is what um but

503
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,200
generally we've seen more in recent

504
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,918
years um which could be linked to

505
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,558
climate change and a slightly warming

506
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,159
climate and a wetter

507
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:01,079
climate um but it's just a general

508
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,080
observation right

509
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,798
now uh like yeah Norway has decided to

510
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,519
follow the trends of the rest of the

511
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,200
world recently um in that because we

512
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,240
have no variety that's really really

513
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,679
good at for storage we need something

514
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,120
that's better that can be stored better

515
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,798
and we also need something that's

516
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:24,399
crispier juicier sweeter attractive to

517
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:28,798
the like new consumers right so we need

518
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,880
a honey crisp type of apple in Norway so

519
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:35,480
the largest distributor decided to um

520
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,480
choose a choose two crossings from the

521
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,400
Netherlands and start planting those so

522
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,240
they both have the same two parents sq1

523
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,400
159 which is a Dutch variety and honey

524
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,400
crust and um one of them is called Eden

525
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:55,320
in Norway it's red and orange pretty

526
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:58,600
firm crunchy super sweet um like that

527
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,960
that's the one thing you taste is sweet

528
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,359
and then the second is freed which is

529
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,120
your more classic looking variety firm

530
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,558
crunchy sweet but more balanced flavor

531
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,239
you taste it or I tast and think this

532
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,359
tastes like Cy

533
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,759
crisp uh so it's great that we have new

534
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,918
varieties that can attract a different

535
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,240
consumer base however following the

536
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,520
trend can have

537
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,200
consequences as we might be aware of

538
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,519
so there seems to be this equation where

539
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,278
if you breed a new variety that has

540
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,278
honey Cris parentage it's of not tested

541
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:33,919
enough and it often has problems once

542
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:37,400
it's commercially planted Norway has

543
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,038
followed that same Trend where you have

544
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,200
a honey Cris parent you have commercial

545
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,720
planting um started without prior

546
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,840
research so for context the oldest trees

547
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,278
in Norway are six years old um the first

548
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,480
commercial production year was 2020 and

549
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,400
that was the first year we could start

550
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,599
research on these trees so that has led

551
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,640
to biannual bearing unsurprised Uris

552
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,199
inly this is this picture is Extreme I

553
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,640
wanted to show it but it it does happen

554
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,080
um and also lots of disorders so the the

555
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,000
two common things that you get with this

556
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:16,839
equation so that's been great for my

557
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,159
research at least because it gives me

558
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:23,798
two things that are relevant across the

559
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,559
at least the post Harvest industry um

560
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:28,000
across the world so the two things I'm

561
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,240
looking at in my research are core

562
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,119
Browning and water core so core

563
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:39,240
Browning just super briefly um is often

564
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,079
worse in cold climate it's not yeah um

565
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,798
so that might be part of why we see it

566
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,759
here um we see it in both Eden and free

567
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,119
but it's also seen in honey crisp and

568
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,640
everris which is another that's a honey

569
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,719
crisp and Fuji

570
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,240
Offspring um and so what I think is

571
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,679
really interesting here is that Eden and

572
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,839
freed seem to have different causes of

573
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,320
core Browning despite being so similarly

574
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:09,278
related so Eden it seems to be very

575
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:11,480
ccent related and freed it seems to be a

576
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,359
variety of factors influencing it not

577
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,679
one factor directly caused with it and

578
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,158
that's the same with honey crisp and

579
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
ever crisp is that that's this

580
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,000
interesting like combination of factors

581
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
all adding up to disorder

582
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,398
incidents

583
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,720
so I think the um discrepancies within

584
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:34,879
similar Cult of Art is fascinating to

585
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,720
me and then water core um

586
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,720
is technically a pre Harvest disorder

587
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,038
but

588
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,399
it's uh excess orbital accumulation in

589
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:48,079
the um intercellular space and we have

590
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:50,479
seen it historically in Norway but it's

591
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,960
only been very stress related water core

592
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,519
which is very externally visible so you

593
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,919
can pick it out on packing lines so it's

594
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:03,398
not really a big problem necessarily

595
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:06,278
um ironically it's related to heat waves

596
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:08,678
and warm growing seasons in Norway um

597
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,200
even though it never gets really hot but

598
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,240
it's warm enough that um if it's warm

599
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,558
near Harvest it will cause water

600
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,640
core um however Eden one of the new

601
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:22,278
varieties gets a different type of water

602
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,880
core called maturity water core um that

603
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,038
happens mostly in the core um and is not

604
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,039
externally

605
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,960
visible and it is some sometimes related

606
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,640
to cool temperatures near Harvest aka

607
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:39,679
the whole growing season in Norway um

608
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,000
and increases with later uh ripening and

609
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,640
later

610
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,640
harvesty and as the current marketing is

611
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,240
that they want to pick this fruit really

612
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,399
late and when it's an orange background

613
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,798
color we get up to

614
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:58,278
76% watercore at harvest in commercially

615
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,759
picked fruit so it's this big issue um

616
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:04,720
and we see it also in everris one of the

617
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:06,079
honey crisp or honey Cris and Fuji cross

618
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,558
but in

619
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:11,278
contrast Eden um is more problematic

620
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,319
because the water core can turn brown

621
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,319
within two to three weeks after

622
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:19,960
harvest so we really need to figure out

623
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,918
how to prevent water core from the start

624
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,798
in

625
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,278
Eden um but I also want to see why it

626
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:28,278
acts so differently in Eden and evercast

627
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:31,200
even though they're related so that

628
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:34,759
brings me quickly to my

629
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,880
thesis which is a similar title to um my

630
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,480
talk today um pre and post Harvest

631
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,278
factors in relation to physiological

632
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,440
disorder development for sustainable

633
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,960
Apple

634
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,200
production um so and it's in

635
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,278
collaboration with nibio Cornell and

636
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,919
nmbu so what that means is I'm looking

637
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,558
mostly at cor Browning and water core

638
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,799
and trying to dig into the causes a

639
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,720
little bit and the growing season and

640
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,960
growing region factors that could impact

641
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,480
disorder development um I won't

642
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,079
necessarily go into all these points um

643
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,720
but if I briefly go over the general

644
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,119
methods just so it's understandable why

645
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm doing it here and why it's could be

646
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,119
applied here so I'm for core Browning

647
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm looking at different storage

648
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,678
temperatures different storage

649
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,519
treatments in all three

650
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,120
varieties um over multiple

651
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:33,200
years um to compare how the same

652
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:36,000
treatments affect the fruit

653
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,440
differently um and I'll look at I'll dig

654
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,720
into ethylene receptor gene expression

655
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,600
as well but it's mostly a applied

656
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,919
storage trial um to really try to

657
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,639
understand why core Browning in Eden is

658
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,038
ccent and related and why it's not in

659
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,640
ever Crispen freed um and how variety

660
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:59,158
and growing season differences and

661
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,278
growing region differences affect that

662
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,200
for water core there's a couple

663
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,519
different sections of this um I'm

664
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,919
looking at Water core development on the

665
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,720
tree and near Harvest at different

666
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,759
Harvest times in both Eden and evercrisp

667
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,000
and trying to see if pattern development

668
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:19,319
like if incident development is similar

669
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,558
across the two and

670
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:25,278
um yeah if that affects different a

671
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,639
certain PA part of the sorbital um

672
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,960
metabolism pathway in the same way or in

673
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,519
different ways in the two

674
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,240
varieties uh and then I'm also doing

675
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,120
kind of the reverse in storage because

676
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,120
water core can go away in storage it can

677
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,639
the sorbitol can be taken up by the

678
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:47,239
fruit um so then I want to see if this

679
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,600
process happens similarly in the two

680
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,960
cultivars in Eden and ever crisp um and

681
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,000
then also if um the gene expression in

682
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,640
the metabolism pathway is kind of the

683
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,159
reverse of at Harvest and on top of that

684
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,480
I want to look and see if you can while

685
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:09,559
here at Cornell um use um some of the

686
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,519
Nano x-ray uh technology to see if you

687
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:15,319
can um track the same fruit through

688
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,640
storage to watch the dissipation in one

689
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:21,439
fruit over time and watch the orbital

690
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,640
kind of go away in a way or be

691
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,600
absorbed and then the final part that's

692
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,720
relevant to Cornell is I want to look at

693
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,119
the effect of root stock on water core

694
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,759
incidents in development so this will be

695
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:37,439
done at the two um root stock planting

696
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:40,158
Trials of everris and Geneva and Hudson

697
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,360
Valley um ideally with a couple

698
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,200
different Harvest timings and looking at

699
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,798
differences in sorbital accumulation

700
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,720
water core development and then because

701
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,158
it's in the two locations looking at

702
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,200
growing region differences with the

703
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:56,799
ultimate goal of eventually maybe this

704
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:00,240
can be then applied in Norway um with

705
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,839
eventual root stock plant things

706
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,440
there

707
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:07,839
um yes so that's what I had to say

708
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,919
really about basically why I'm here why

709
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:14,240
I my research could be at all

710
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:17,360
relevant um and just wanted to end with

711
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,120
my actual office

712
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:25,599
views um I have a corner office

713
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:28,239
so I look out on these two views um and

714
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,798
then this is my field office

715
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,519
uh and just a plug is we have a post

716
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:37,278
Harvest pathology conference happening

717
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,798
hopefully in Spring 2026 in Norway um so

718
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:42,359
if you want to see these views in person

719
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:46,720
you're welcome to come for

720
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:50,359
them that's what I have guess one

721
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,360
one there any

722
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,519
questions SE

723
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,638
questions what whe the soil is

724
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,359
like it seems me there's not a whole lot

725
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,879
of weathering so yeah

726
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,199
it's yeah so Marvin's asking about the

727
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,799
different soils um so they're very

728
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,000
organic actually uh because it's so cold

729
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,879
that there is a lot of erosion at times

730
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,638
because you can have landslides and

731
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,559
avalanches and everything um but nothing

732
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:27,038
decomposes really

733
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,839
fast so it's a really high organic

734
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,079
matter soil

735
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:35,319
I I don't know the other basis for the

736
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:38,199
soils actually um and I maybe

737
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,439
should but they relatively deep I mean

738
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,558
you have trage issues yeah they are I

739
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,440
think they are relatively deep

740
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:51,398
um there yeah they

741
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,399
work well enough that's

742
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:54,398
yeah

743
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,760
um yeah there's one question in the chat

744
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,398
from Thomas saying is there any

745
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:06,079
potential for newer varieties used in

746
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:08,599
central Sweden um like Ren Silva and

747
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,798
Frederick they're not known for storage

748
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,918
um I haven't heard of any of those

749
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:17,759
varieties actually

750
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:20,440
um but we do often most of our varieties

751
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:23,519
actually come from Sweden

752
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,080
um and we tend to grow the same things

753
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,399
as in Sweden

754
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,319
so there is potential that we could use

755
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,199
those as

756
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:36,079
well yeah about your boot stock so you

757
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,960
said in Norway it's 800 years

758
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:42,398
cultivation yeah okay so how is it that

759
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,639
in 2014 it seems like there's one root

760
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,158
stock that seems to be what replacing it

761
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:50,199
seems pretty dangerous to have one root

762
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,120
stock you would think over 800 years

763
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,558
there would be some resistance that

764
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:56,678
build up and and so is there any effort

765
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,319
to try to look for that and put that

766
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,278
into the breeding line

767
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,079
in future yeah yeah so the question is

768
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:07,000
about um why we still use the same root

769
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,119
stock after or yeah why we everything

770
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,119
has grown on M9 even though we've been

771
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,679
growing for 800 years

772
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,800
and how that impacts different

773
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,878
resistance to diseases and such and I

774
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,000
would say and if we're looking into it

775
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:26,000
so we do have root stock plantings we're

776
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,039
part of the Euro fin um Network and so

777
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,480
we do look into different um root stocks

778
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:35,159
but the problem really is that

779
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,079
commercially because we have such low

780
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:42,079
volumes it's hard

781
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,800
to um ask for very specific varieties on

782
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,599
very specific root

783
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,560
stocks so I think that's a large part of

784
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,359
why we're forc why we all have M9 is

785
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,239
because we just can't get anything else

786
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,799
other than just M9 because the root the

787
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,000
uh nurseries don't want to offer us

788
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:03,320
anything other than just M9

789
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,119
um but hopefully we can um steer away

790
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,720
from that and

791
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,079
towards a more more variation in the

792
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,118
root stocks because it is dangerous to

793
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,000
plan on the same ground for so long for

794
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,519
sure

795
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,800
yeah yeah so my question has a little

796
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,800
bit of background and it's that uh I'm

797
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,480
from Ontario Canada where in the 1980s

798
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,839
the provincial government spent many

799
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,920
millions of dollars paying great Growers

800
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,880
to pull out Cult of virs that didn't

801
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
work anymore and then they gave them

802
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,079
money to put in cultivars that work so

803
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:39,000
if there's 5,000 Acres of apple trees in

804
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,400
Norway and all of these problems such as

805
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,400
the cultiv bars aren't right and there's

806
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,680
one root stock and that sort of thing uh

807
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,599
has Norway I it would never happen here

808
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,078
in the States but is Norway considered

809
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,359
just paying the Growers to pull them all

810
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,240
out and put in some robust

811
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:57,759
cultivars yeah so the question is about

812
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,318
why don't we just take out the ones that

813
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,960
don't the cultivars that don't work and

814
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:05,079
put in new ones and government yeah

815
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,519
exactly yeah government grer dollars as

816
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,318
well struggling with these cultivars

817
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,358
that that don't seem to that's what the

818
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:15,039
two new cultivars were supposed to do so

819
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:17,519
that was there's there was this big push

820
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,519
um Eden and Fred have been the two most

821
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,880
highly planted cultivars ever

822
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:26,079
potentially like it's a for Norway it's

823
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,599
a lot of trees planted um right they

824
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,160
were supposed to bring along the like

825
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,599
new Revolution and it's not working so

826
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:38,318
far so because they didn't they didn't

827
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,318
do enough testing um so I I think that

828
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:43,880
might go along eventually but there's

829
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:45,800
also this push back where some people

830
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,280
want the traditional varieties even

831
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,240
though they don't store well or anything

832
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,480
right because that's a Norwegian Apple a

833
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,439
Norwegian apple is supposed to be soft

834
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,838
Norwegian apples supposed to smell like

835
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,119
raw because that's just the smell of

836
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,719
Norwegian apples

837
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:04,880
um so

838
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:06,559
there's there's some back and forth um

839
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
but I I think in some ways it could be

840
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,039
good to just kind

841
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,400
of reset but you have to have enough

842
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:15,880
knowledge about the varieties that

843
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,639
you're going to plan and that's that was

844
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,800
the key problem that we've learned

845
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:24,879
now so yeah oh yeah great presentation I

846
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,160
guess my question is in regards to the

847
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,519
uh banal bearing habits so

848
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,920
um from what I gathered from the

849
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,159
presentation that seems to be kind of

850
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,680
the the trend in the way the orchard is

851
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,838
managed there's very little thinning and

852
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,559
if it all is hand thinning do you think

853
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:43,400
that's going to be kind of an issue is

854
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,000
climate change kind ofes more prominent

855
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,160
in the future right with like they

856
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,358
spring Frost I'm just thinking like you

857
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,879
know if you're managing the orchard by

858
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,440
any Elite you have a frost event right

859
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,720
then your crop's going by by right so

860
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,639
that was a like a crop insurance plan

861
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,519
the grower couldn't bu into for that

862
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:05,639
like how that work yeah so the question

863
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:08,318
was about different biannual or like how

864
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,598
biannual bearing system essentially is

865
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:12,400
going to be impacted by climate change

866
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,240
and

867
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,559
in there is crop insurance we do have

868
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,399
that um but I I think there's a there's

869
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,279
definitely a push

870
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,000
towards uh preventing B anual bearing

871
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,839
and there's a push towards more annual

872
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,358
bearing and I think that's going to be

873
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:31,838
the solution frankly to B annual bearing

874
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,759
and climate change is annual

875
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,639
production um so it's just and with the

876
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,400
warming climate chemical thinners will

877
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:42,679
work better so then it'll be easier um

878
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,280
hopefully to have an annual production

879
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:48,879
system um so but I I think it's also

880
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,720
just getting Growers to understand the

881
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,358
economic benefits of thinning and some

882
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:57,559
people get it and some

883
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,318
people don't or or don't

884
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,679
care enough like they're fine with what

885
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:06,480
they have right now and it works for

886
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:10,159
them thank so yeah yeah you clarify the

887
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,760
roock issue what was the rostock used by

888
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:16,519
the Norwegian Apple industry before 2014

889
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,720
yeah so before 2019 it was or 2014 it

890
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:23,280
was also still M9 that was used so since

891
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,279
since we've been doing um dwarfing root

892
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,880
Sox has been

893
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,760
M9 um for time yeah yeah it was just

894
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,400
before 2014 we weren't allowed to buy um

895
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,920
trees from other countries we had to

896
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,720
produce everything internally and it was

897
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,599
really

898
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,879
expensive so from 2014 it was allowed

899
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,359
for us to buy it elsewhere and looking

900
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,920
at the temperature sort of the seasonal

901
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:50,480
change of temperature average

902
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,280
temperatures the uh area where apples

903
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,639
are grown in Norway actually the

904
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,800
temperatures are higher than EA right

905
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:00,039
during the winter oh during the winter

906
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,079
yes yes yeah it's a much more stable

907
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:08,039
climate yeah so cold damage or winter

908
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,599
freezing damage is rarely an issue yeah

909
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:13,800
it it happens but it's not a big problem

910
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:13,800
for sure okay

911
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,240
yeah yeah just wondering a little bit

912
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,358
more about the The Cider industry are

913
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,719
they using these culinary varieties or

914
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:24,000
do they have different traditional

915
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,358
varieties that they've been using for

916
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,519
cider or they bringing in varieties from

917
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,318
from other parts of Europe or what's

918
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,679
happening yeah so the cider industry is

919
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,279
mostly based off of the dessert apples

920
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:41,318
um so it's really big on single varietal

921
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,160
cers actually uh you you do have Blends

922
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,519
uh but there's also like marketing for

923
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,759
like a specific ARA cider and a specific

924
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:51,318
Gravenstein

925
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,720
cider um they are bringing in British uh

926
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:57,679
CER varieties as well uh and bringing

927
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:02,118
back some old traditional varieties but

928
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:05,078
most of it is leftover from um from

929
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,519
industry like it's industry fruit um

930
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,240
with some people growing specifically

931
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:13,199
for cider it'll solve your post Harvest

932
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:16,598
issue right there yeah it helps a lot

933
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:19,159
yeah there there it definitely does a

934
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:22,039
lot for it

935
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,679
yeah what do you mean by culinary

936
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,639
varieties I thought those are fresh

937
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,799
Apple apples for Fresh Markets culinary

938
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,159
means for

939
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,200
cooking right for kitchen use well I

940
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,960
don't know the term culinary can mean

941
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,239
Fresh Market or fresh eating but I guess

942
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,400
that's what I meant the the the VAR The

943
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,318
Fresh Market varieties

944
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,200
yeah yeah I kind had a related question

945
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:47,358
how would you describe the average

946
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,318
consumer there in nor way compared to

947
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,279
like the US like are they more

948
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:55,119
sophisticated they know BR they ask for

949
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,560
varieties you know here they're you know

950
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,680
are they and how much do they eat

951
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,279
relative to to like say a typical

952
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,440
American yeah so the average consumer in

953
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,640
Norway does not know different varieties

954
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,318
um sometimes they know Norwegian variety

955
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,318
like one or two Norwegian varieties but

956
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:15,920
it's still like red green yellow apple a

957
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:17,880
lot of the time um they also generally

958
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,240
um

959
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,720
have because we're at the end of the

960
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:26,838
supply chain the quality in general of

961
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:28,399
our fruits and vegetables are lower I

962
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:34,960
would say than in the

963
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:37,920
US um so generally they're less picky

964
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,720
perhaps in some ways um at least I've

965
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,480
had to become less picky when I'm there

966
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,358
but I'm not a traditional consumer

967
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,000
either I will

968
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:47,598
qualify um but it's a very meat and

969
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,159
potatoes

970
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,200
country um so you have meat and potatoes

971
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:57,199
for dinner with a side of

972
00:42:52,199 --> 00:43:00,239
vegetables um so it's also very like

973
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,960
like traditional um crops still right

974
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:07,039
like very root vegetable

975
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:09,039
based um but it it's expanding um the

976
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,639
consumer base is definitely getting more

977
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,000
adventurous and trying more things and

978
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,440
demanding more so we're we're getting

979
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,119
there I think we're just like 10 years

980
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,119
behind the US in Trends it's my

981
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,679
guesss I presume there are Imports and

982
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,319
or not yeah there's there are where they

983
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,960
coming from so our Imports mostly come

984
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:33,358
from Italy and

985
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
Poland um but we also get stuff from New

986
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:38,119
Zealand and Chile depending on the

987
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,400
season obviously um but when possible it

988
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,599
tries to be we try to be in

989
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,039
Europe but you know the question was do

990
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,440
consumers know their apples are they all

991
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:52,558
La by variet

992
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,039
though sometimes okay um normally when

993
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,599
you have Norwegian apples it's Norwegian

994
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,480
red apples this much per Kil

995
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,880
so the grocery stores aren't helping

996
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,400
either right and like sometimes they

997
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,480
separate out the Norwegian apples and

998
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,760
they'll put like Norwegian flags up and

999
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,760
sometimes they don't um so there there

1000
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,040
needs to be more work at the grocery

1001
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,559
store side of it too right and the

1002
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:17,159
distributor side of it to like really

1003
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,640
sell but import apples are so cheap so

1004
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,279
it just makes it easier to just sell

1005
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:24,318
import

1006
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,720
apples so

1007
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,599
yeah yeah I me was the restrict

1008
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,679
regulation for using pesticide and

1009
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,720
fungicide in Europe and Norway right how

1010
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:37,519
you overcome the wet weather there and

1011
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:39,598
what's also like during the preh Harvest

1012
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,000
and post Harvest and what's the impact

1013
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,240
of the total amount of the production

1014
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,280
which can be consumed or go to the

1015
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:50,919
storage yeah

1016
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:54,040
so we don't really have a great way to

1017
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,480
overcome the impact of limited

1018
00:44:54,039 --> 00:45:00,079
pesticides and the growing season in the

1019
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,639
wetness um so we get a lot of fruit

1020
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:06,000
rot um and we also can apply pesticide

1021
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:07,440
or uh fungicides post Harvest we can't

1022
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,079
apply anything post Harvest we can't

1023
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:16,760
apply wax and like nothing um so there's

1024
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,640
a lot of we try to use cultural methods

1025
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:23,040
right and try to be good about sorting

1026
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:25,199
pre- sorting fruit when we can um and

1027
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,318
right now the big um thing we've

1028
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,199
realized is that a lot of Growers Don't

1029
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,960
Spray fungicides after

1030
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:35,000
July so now we're trying to push for a

1031
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,760
spray of fundra sdes in August so that

1032
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,480
they actually work post Harvest so I I

1033
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,040
think that's the The Next Step that will

1034
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,719
increase our storability a lot and

1035
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:52,318
increase our marketable

1036
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:52,318
fruit okay good then thank you yeah

1037
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:08,558
this has been a production of Cornell

1038
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,558
University on the web at cornell.edu
