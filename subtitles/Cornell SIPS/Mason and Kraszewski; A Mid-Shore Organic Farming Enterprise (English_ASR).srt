1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:19,350
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:22,739
University we decided that the organic

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,118
farming and today we got about a

4
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,598
thousand acres of the farmer

5
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:30,149
mechanically we actually the first year

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:36,289
that we did start we did start with some

7
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:39,460
organic or transitional provisions

8
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:42,460
exactly a year ago

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,100
very year we've had some great success

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:50,399
and we've had some failures also just

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,399
does Matt and Paul Simon

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:07,310
I think not at all so we weep on the

13
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:11,390
gamut point you plan alive

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,700
ladies also or I want to conventional

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,790
even though I think one year we

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,939
participated with 10 estate rotatable

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,090
handsome

18
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,429
and not much success and then a couple

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,969
years ago we planted 20 acres of those

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:33,179
billboards with the same exalted success

21
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:36,688
but we are I guess very interested in

22
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:39,840
no-till where we've used aspect know

23
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:44,038
organic farming I think that's one of

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,500
the issues that organic farmers in

25
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,500
general have telling us

26
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,730
each tillage but it's hard to do

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:06,980
the the other thing that we like about

28
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,579
news television is just my style all

29
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,780
myself

30
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:15,050
language is a great flavor savings as a

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,680
time factor we have for life owners

32
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,890
until within 15 follower of informants

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,510
still job duty equipment and time as a

34
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:29,059
factor and as most of you know in

35
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:30,799
organic farming time is crucial whether

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,110
you're planting cultivating whatever you

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,709
know it on whatever planet Earth Agra

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,690
time is very important it seems I just

39
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,400
added a point quickly built is it seems

40
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:43,879
like our windows for getting things done

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,860
planting management anything that's

42
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,439
almost any part of the year but

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,270
especially the spring is shrinking those

44
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,000
windows are just getting smaller and

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,380
you've got to get more done and less

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,180
than I'm finally the same not done and

47
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,340
less amount of time and you've got to

48
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,769
find you've got to have options you got

49
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:13,599
to have solutions you got to have as

50
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:16,219
Matt put it adaptive management but

51
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,979
seems like the window of opportunity is

52
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:22,239
smaller

53
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:26,378
is the approach the problems that we

54
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,599
have encountered one thing that I know

55
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:31,509
Steve domination our one thing we have

56
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,839
on this year's spirit village after

57
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:37,750
barley that develops critical machine

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,789
thinking that we got issues getting them

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,789
that materially so we need to establish

60
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,140
perhaps be exactly where you're just

61
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:58,030
telling up a script and making the rest

62
00:03:50,139 --> 00:04:00,009
of the residue there and we have values

63
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,079
excitedly not only motivated to the soil

64
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:04,149
needs to be planted ever we get 35 acres

65
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,129
here the stretch has got some potential

66
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,030
that

67
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:15,449
be sure to establish the seat the soul

68
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:17,579
convicts they okay well I think well I

69
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,199
just I could skip around with the the

70
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,669
presentation here presentation here I

71
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,189
try to to modify it for this talk of

72
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,699
course on the itinerary there for our

73
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,180
talk

74
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:32,189
you know we're I guess focusing on

75
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,650
no-till cover crops and I would like to

76
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:37,139
definitely focus on that but maybe just

77
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,239
go through a brief overview of our

78
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,589
operation it's not too far into the

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,900
slides here but really we're gonna

80
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:45,359
highlight and we're gonna overlap a lot

81
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:49,439
conceptually with what Matt has already

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,870
spoken about and cloths also there's

83
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,430
just there's we probably could have all

84
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,620
four stuck here for about an hour and a

85
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,180
half and and did just being Punk back

86
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,129
and forth off each other and it would

87
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,300
have worked out pretty well but yeah

88
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,480
we're going to touch on a lot of those

89
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,160
same subjects and experiences have just

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,980
probably come at it from our perspective

91
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,450
down on the lower Eastern Shore of

92
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,270
Maryland or just look excuse me the

93
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,250
middle so Eastern Shore of Maryland

94
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,659
where we if they succeed things a little

95
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,129
differently or we just want to give you

96
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,290
a kind of example of maybe where we've

97
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,990
been where we are now and hopefully

98
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,860
where we're going to be going so to move

99
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,860
on here I would

100
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:38,209
you're late May and

101
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,590
lots of common oh just we see although

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,940
there's a lot there's plenty of

103
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,719
challenges but with every challenge it

104
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:56,540
seems like there's plenty of

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,280
opportunities with passing the two-year

106
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,200
rotation it seems like we lock in to

107
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,879
certain specific pest cycles will go

108
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,168
over those sort of things that

109
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,230
specifically when we're talking about

110
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:08,000
some of our no-till soybeans

111
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:12,439
predominantly a weeds our biggest pests

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,910
our biggest concerns right now and with

113
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,839
our later making and increased tillage

114
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,130
in certain situations general we seem to

115
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,319
have seen more aggressive annual

116
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,719
broadleaf weeds that we have to deal

117
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,279
with we're looking for different ways to

118
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,650
try to interrupt those pest cycles or

119
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,388
the weed cycles and that's where we're

120
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,429
trying to enter into using yes less

121
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,530
tillage minimum tillage minimum

122
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,600
disturbance sometimes no-till sometimes

123
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,949
different crops and the rotation to

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,950
break up those cycles something that's

125
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,389
for example peas peas that can be

126
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,719
planted much earlier and harvested in

127
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,129
just different times it will hopefully

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,340
interrupt like you said or disrupt those

129
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,560
test cycles especially if you're going

130
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,199
to be going into soybeans one of the

131
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,168
issues we've had three spraying spans

132
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,829
from the way is frame and it seems like

133
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:02,258
we're facing

134
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:05,168
we have great intentions of starting

135
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,999
planning for the 1st of May and you know

136
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:10,959
I did the mayor got our beans planted

137
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:13,719
and it hasn't worked that way and we

138
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,149
found we have a constant battle either

139
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:18,189
prop sent later than a color cross going

140
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:20,649
later than the next spring they come off

141
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:25,659
later in a system fights a never-ending

142
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:28,778
cycle but we've got Atlanta season corn

143
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:30,759
and harvest earlier we have rain systems

144
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:34,930
of the entire grain but there's still

145
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:37,419
have issues like I said it's all about

146
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,598
the timing and I think getting the cover

147
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:42,639
crops in and fall earlier is a great

148
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,759
asset and it just seems like we have a

149
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,468
hard time meeting that goal I think we

150
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,408
it seems like we've run the gamut of

151
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:52,509
just about almost every type of

152
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:54,459
situation that we can think of ourselves

153
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,838
I know there's there's got to be more be

154
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,218
more out there depending on type of

155
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,769
management your type of rotation and

156
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:02,408
even the crops but then generally for

157
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,908
our two-year rotation yes it seems like

158
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:05,649
we you know just going back to if we

159
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:07,658
have to go back to conventional tillage

160
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,778
we just seek still see the same problems

161
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:12,188
we don't seem to be even if you can work

162
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,718
the field several times and try to

163
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:17,110
diminish the weed seed bank we still

164
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:19,329
have aggressive weeds part of that what

165
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,249
we believe and I think is we of course

166
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,930
you farm a certain way certain rotation

167
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,849
you select for certain weeds it's really

168
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,468
answered biogenic selection you know as

169
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:28,418
the farmers you know you you've planted

170
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:30,158
certain dates you do operations with

171
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:31,149
cultivating work in the ground certain

172
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:33,278
dates you're going to select certain

173
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,719
weeds that fit into those little gaps

174
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,908
where you want working the ground where

175
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,159
they're gonna emerge and they can be

176
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:40,838
much more aggressive than the crop corn

177
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:42,668
or soybeans so that you've planted and

178
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,930
it's it's all about trying to find

179
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:48,730
another way to to find a way around that

180
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,179
or just find a way to least get your

181
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,579
crops

182
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:54,458
far enough ahead where you you have

183
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:57,250
other options tools in your toolkit to

184
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:59,138
address those weed issues other

185
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,139
challenges challenges Bill's touched on

186
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,360
management and labor cost of fertilizers

187
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:08,289
and trying to grow course our

188
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,220
our nitrogen for our corn availability

189
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:13,808
for some foreign sources of our of

190
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,420
nutrients sometimes can be an issue if

191
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:33,879
you're not trying to grow your nitrogen

192
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:36,838
or you go into a part of it we do that

193
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:42,370
every year on our

194
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,810
madacorp the next frame and we're we've

195
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,570
had a pretty good success doing that

196
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:53,828
bird growing I think anywhere from 60 80

197
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:56,140
pounds in the spring so that that

198
00:09:53,828 --> 00:10:00,099
provides us about kind of Atlanta to

199
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:01,990
Leeds but we're going all the way we

200
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,389
ground us to clover suitable rings

201
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,720
that's your harder corn ground it's not

202
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:13,179
a barley or grain the rest of the planet

203
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,180
why this would just be a quick summary

204
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:18,759
of just our rotation our kind of a

205
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:21,338
traditional two-year crop rotation from

206
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:25,629
corn grain to fall cover crop light

207
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:27,730
planted after the corn and then the

208
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,740
soybeans whether it's you use the Rye or

209
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,110
not we will be planting soybeans

210
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,120
following that that rye we decide to

211
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,860
terminate it early or late and then

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,028
finally soybeans are they'll just

213
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,259
mentioned cover crop that's flowing on

214
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:43,450
it is a mixture of crimson clover and

215
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,730
barley that's really a really reason is

216
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,339
for it's a mixture it's we participate

217
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,659
in our state cover crop program and they

218
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,760
do require it weather though with the

219
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:54,759
legume to have a small grain mixed in

220
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,159
although some that we did we can will we

221
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,629
can debate that if we want a little bit

222
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,189
later if it's really necessary or not

223
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:04,600
and these are just some of the

224
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:07,709
operations we're looking at in between

225
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,659
for managing for cover crop management

226
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:13,359
between corn grain and far I depths of

227
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,069
color crop early is the best we will

228
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
repeat that just like you've heard

229
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,610
there's probably a lot already these

230
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,809
earlier sessions and in this room to be

231
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,278
arrow which is nice saved a lot of time

232
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:26,889
for us and those soybeans those soybeans

233
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,539
that haven't been cultivated

234
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,708
establishes a little nicer you have a

235
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,088
little more bare soil a lot of more

236
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,739
nooks and crannies for that small seed

237
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,449
to fall into and all you really need is

238
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,220
a little bit of precipitation and it

239
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:37,778
seems to take right off and probably

240
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,190
four out of five years it does pretty

241
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,838
well we've had years where we've had

242
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,420
poor crop spend maybe a poor winner

243
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,250
but in general it's usually a pretty

244
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,909
sure bet when it's flown on into a

245
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,909
cultivated

246
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:50,490
soybean field

247
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:52,289
now if you had if you were able to do

248
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,490
no-till soybeans and you still have a

249
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:56,899
lot of that right cover on we've had

250
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,068
issues with establishing that legume

251
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,600
barley mixture it's just because that

252
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:03,059
cover is still there that rye is

253
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,259
persistent it's supposed to be but it's

254
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:11,599
sent at tens do we get spotty uneven

255
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,600
stands of our cover crop and then

256
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:21,169
contact and several years we've done it

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,169
we've been planning

258
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:24,340
good

259
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,639
so and then so basically in this picture

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,960
here this is a slide year there it deals

261
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,659
with establishing the cover crop or

262
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,580
terminating it so and I talked to

263
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,709
obviously talked about an establishing

264
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,420
and terminating is if your rife you do

265
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,370
want to use the right but you have the

266
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:48,349
biomass you think you can make it work

267
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,639
roll down otherwise you got destroyed

268
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,259
earlier although that comes with its own

269
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,669
consequences we're probably talk about

270
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:56,169
that a little bit as we move along here

271
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:58,759
and took my time to proceed here and

272
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:00,559
with our corn grain if we're trying to

273
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,110
incorporate our corn grain trying to

274
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,599
release that nitrogen it's either been

275
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,419
plowing down or disking and we still

276
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,360
we're still it's a decision to make

277
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,519
plowing is slower a lot more intensive a

278
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,350
lot more I have an erosion issue you get

279
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,000
a big rain event disking it's a little

280
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,320
quicker although you might not get the

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,519
field conditions you like for planting

282
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,230
you got a lot of residue on the surface

283
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,389
area even with a decent planter you

284
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,100
might have some pest issues too we've

285
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,899
had issues with for example cutworm in

286
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,060
the field we thought it had a lot to do

287
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,279
with the residue still in the surface in

288
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,629
some parts of the field some of those

289
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,339
pests like to lay their eggs on the

290
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,809
residue and of course when plant your

291
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,250
crop in there of course that residues

292
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,649
only been incorporated two or three

293
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,450
inches that's your your seeds about two

294
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,250
inches it's right there amongst those of

295
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:49,280
those pests there they're there and

296
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,539
waiting for it so I threw this in your

297
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,829
groups real quickly as an as an

298
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,179
alternative something you could you

299
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,639
could stick in to possibly break up the

300
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:58,219
pest cycle starting there and with

301
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,439
instead of fall right we've done we've

302
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,029
put in fall barley one big reason it's

303
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,980
it's profitable extra money there's a

304
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:07,970
good price for it for organic barley

305
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:11,090
there's the demand and you do have to

306
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,040
fertilize you have to fertilize it but

307
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,540
what we've used before are a company

308
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,429
that we use that has some organic

309
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,929
fertilizer now they will they've done it

310
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:20,659
for a lot of dairy farms they'll put the

311
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,949
the seed the red clover seed in with the

312
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,329
fertilizer it comes out the booms it

313
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,920
sprays out that seeds small enough they

314
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,379
have the right nozzles they can

315
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:30,319
intercede when they your topdressing in

316
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:32,149
the spring and you can get a you start

317
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,579
your establish you establish your your

318
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:37,928
your crop in the spring and it's

319
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:39,548
very simple it's one less pass you have

320
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:42,458
to do it's it's very it's it's a nice

321
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:44,019
option for us and if the case is where

322
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,508
you want a summer fallow if you as long

323
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:49,409
as you the numbers work out on paper if

324
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:52,239
it's a farm you're you're not sure about

325
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:55,328
or you have you just have your point in

326
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:56,559
time in your season where or your

327
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,568
management where you know you've got a

328
00:14:56,558 --> 00:15:01,298
lot of other you got other farms you got

329
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:02,828
acres you're spread out you just don't

330
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,749
want that that summer you just don't

331
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:07,568
have time like so the numbers work out

332
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:09,639
you'll summer fallow that red clovers

333
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:11,409
come on real nice you just have to mow

334
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,548
for weed management you know you have to

335
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,868
you have to kind of be a stickler for

336
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:15,338
that tried to tonight try to keep the

337
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:19,028
weeds down mow high keep the clover

338
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,319
growing and then instead of your crimson

339
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:21,428
clover that was flown on that will be

340
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,798
flown on the fall you already have

341
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:25,509
something established ready to go there

342
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,789
next spring and we've seen it produce

343
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:30,428
quite a bit of nitrogen for us I think I

344
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:35,919
include that a few other slides here in

345
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:39,519
the future so for us as I mentioned peas

346
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:42,368
we like it - it could spend good money

347
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,959
maker for us in the past it's good for

348
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:46,778
breaking up those pest cycles early

349
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,698
spring planting early summer harvest you

350
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:49,899
can still maintain your row crop cycle

351
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,238
you can plant you'd like to plant

352
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:55,089
soybeans after it the pest and weed

353
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:56,649
management typically when we were we fit

354
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:59,589
the field usually uh sometimes a flush

355
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,850
of weeds or if we can't control the

356
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,350
weeds as well as we want we know that

357
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,119
they won't go to sea by the time it's

358
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,668
ready to harvest a lot of those weeds it

359
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:09,879
might be till July before they're there

360
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:11,019
seed heads are mature and and you have

361
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,489
to worry about that but if it's being

362
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,808
harvested in June along with the peas

363
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:15,819
one of those harvesters come in that's

364
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,918
all taken off and you maybe have that

365
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:21,128
you the diminisher weed seed bank some

366
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:23,139
what we have tried spinach early fall

367
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:26,739
zone there wasn't a whole lot success

368
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:29,649
with this system the company pet wanted

369
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:30,879
that wanted to try it out I just don't

370
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,289
believe they had they had a lot of other

371
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,178
things going on they had a lot of other

372
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,588
conventional spinach Acres going on I

373
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:37,328
don't think they quite had the right

374
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,769
equipment they seemed to have a weed

375
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:41,318
issue here they were able to get one

376
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,178
cutting off and very late fall or

377
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,298
actually not early winter or December I

378
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:47,470
believe they took it off and instead of

379
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,299
getting another cutting in the spring

380
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,480
they just let it go

381
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:56,549
we went straight right into corn so the

382
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,560
peas and spinach alternative income it

383
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,209
can be pretty good the pretty good

384
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,469
moneymaker for us I said the numbers

385
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,879
have to work also you know along with

386
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,200
these other along with a lot of the

387
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,289
other things you know that we're looking

388
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:12,170
to and in the rotation in a whole farm

389
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:17,599
management system and in past cycles and

390
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,600
harvest well they can benefit for those

391
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:41,410
I think we could do better we've got a

392
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:46,109
crop occurrences and

393
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:48,130
we use everything just having a beard

394
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:49,809
this one I hear bill if you want to talk

395
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,050
about it it's just kind of a quick and

396
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:54,940
dirty breakdown of just the numbers when

397
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:59,039
we were you're doing either no-till a

398
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,039
soybean or conventionally tilled soybean

399
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:37,279
they own their $92 I prefer your net it

400
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:41,829
comes about

401
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:45,509
so that one reason the requirement was

402
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,509
best buy us later

403
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:55,259
yeah so just those are basically the

404
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,029
economics when you put that pencil to

405
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,069
the paper of course a lot of you know a

406
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,539
lot of what Matt's been talking about in

407
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,470
class and a lot of other speakers have

408
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,928
been talking about or some of those

409
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,819
figures you don't have a fine a good

410
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,919
grasp on or a quantitative number just

411
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,058
to put on paper but you know with a lot

412
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,770
a lot of the research that's been done

413
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,319
over the years and a little a lot of

414
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:15,839
with the work between farmers and

415
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,990
extension and university and so on and

416
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,058
NRCS we you know we know that there's

417
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,349
benefits there we've seen them we can't

418
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,750
quantify some of them in certain cases

419
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:26,548
some we can't but usually you can talk

420
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,490
to the farmer directly they can probably

421
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:30,779
tell you what works what doesn't and

422
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,029
where they see the benefits where they

423
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,500
can see room for improvement but we know

424
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,960
they're there but this is just to give

425
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,298
you a quick just quick overview of what

426
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,130
what we're looking at when when we just

427
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,720
try to put numbers of numbers down on

428
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,480
the page so basically the net income per

429
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,240
acre for a no-till $280 per acre versus

430
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,519
conventional 168 and that basically it's

431
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,269
due to this field operations the

432
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,960
difference there

433
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:56,548
really you only have a most your cost in

434
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,919
the conventional till as you're plowing

435
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:00,418
existing all your field work pullin up

436
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,250
the tractor pulling that equipment and

437
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,640
your labor to of course paying somebody

438
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:10,048
to do it and how it really adds up on

439
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:14,059
you and then then it comes down to your

440
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:14,058
net and we can see where we come out

441
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:30,048
and here's the other thing I'd like to

442
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,519
mention is about several people this

443
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:35,220
planet no utility the same time and

444
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,519
labor even if eagerly evolution less per

445
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,519
favore

446
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:49,599
just a quick overview of our two main

447
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:51,339
cover cut family the legumes and the

448
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,349
cereal grains course you legumes you got

449
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:55,480
your clovers vetch Cal P field P and

450
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:58,418
even the Sun health although we are

451
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,220
using really the clover red and or

452
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,788
crimson but kind of for two different

453
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,759
reasons

454
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:06,158
Nico grain rye barley we tried to try

455
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,240
some wheat this year have that planted I

456
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,000
have never tried to oats or trittye

457
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,470
triticale but and that can be popular

458
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,778
with certain systems like arrest and

459
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:17,200
organic dairy for chopping for example

460
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:18,369
but obviously that forage for dry seems

461
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,360
to have a market if you can find

462
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:21,609
somebody to sell to if they've got

463
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,528
animals you got an operation they need

464
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:25,359
it if it's a drought year like loss was

465
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:27,250
saying if you got it out there maybe you

466
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,709
can make it you can make something off

467
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:33,250
it and it'll all work out

468
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,308
Nebraska's grasses canola's canola

469
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,079
radishes radishes grass acid and grass

470
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:42,700
sort of today and until it warms see

471
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:45,699
them rye main characteristics is an

472
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,610
annual high biomass potential good

473
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,590
course weed suppression and that's due

474
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:53,829
to the ligneous nature at boot stage

475
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:56,470
crimson clover an annual winter hardy

476
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:59,589
most often more often than not very good

477
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,028
nitrogen production fast growth seems

478
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:03,638
like it's established it's pretty easily

479
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:05,409
we've we've broadcast clove around the

480
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:07,148
field and then drilled over it with just

481
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,120
our grain and it comes right up with it

482
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:11,558
it works pretty well so just cuz those

483
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,268
pressed wheels using a seven half-inch

484
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:14,648
spacing drill press wheels it just

485
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,028
incorporates it just into the surface

486
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:17,678
and as long as you get a little bit of

487
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:21,519
moisture takes off right with the rest

488
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,769
of it it's coming right up and barley

489
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,609
that's our other cover crop I'll talk

490
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,609
about that in a second

491
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,700
let's gonna move down here a little bit

492
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:36,799
there's a picture of some clover and

493
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:39,350
some like rye we're looking for biomass

494
00:22:36,799 --> 00:23:14,899
weed suppression biomass for our legumes

495
00:22:39,349 --> 00:23:16,819
you want money nitrogen so we're anxious

496
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,259
to combine that see that's made any

497
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:21,200
difference in the soybean yields

498
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:24,170
compared to the spring we are also

499
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,200
looking for maybe a way to perhaps give

500
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,870
us some little synergistic boost to the

501
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,850
the Rye of course we all know that I

502
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:35,659
would assume most most of us know that

503
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:38,539
legumes they fix nitrogen and of course

504
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,060
any crop with roots you know entangled

505
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,559
in the below the ground with it will try

506
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,289
to feed off some of that nitrogen and

507
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,809
perhaps we thought maybe if we've had

508
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:49,730
years where our biomass for a ride men

509
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:52,069
quite where we want it we said well if

510
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,839
at the very least it might give it a few

511
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:56,240
pounds of nitrogen while it's growing

512
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,709
and add to you know add a little bit of

513
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,980
biomass it might put us over the top or

514
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:03,980
we said we can go all in on a no-till

515
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,420
situation and even if it we didn't think

516
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,759
it gave a whole lot of nitrogen to the

517
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,230
Rye well we still have some biomass

518
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,599
although it's a little more fleeting

519
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,640
because we know that clover is more of a

520
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,529
succulent crop but give a little more

521
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,509
biomass to the whole system and then if

522
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,129
it rolled down it still might provide

523
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,109
enough time assuming everything else

524
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,390
works out in your favor for that crap to

525
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:24,979
get up and then you can and then maybe

526
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,200
you know your soybeans get ahead of your

527
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,839
weeds and then you have more beans than

528
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,269
weeds out in the field so a quick

529
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,079
picture of our our rig for no-till and

530
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:39,339
that was what we did this

531
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:41,199
summer with 150 acres of no-till we had

532
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:43,538
a pretty good rye crop and I don't want

533
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,610
to mention one thing if you can see over

534
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:46,750
here this field this is the direction

535
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,459
the field runs it's basically a big

536
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,230
rectangle and that's just a turn row

537
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,230
along a hedgerow but you can see our

538
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,919
angle for planting in the lands back and

539
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:58,870
forth back and forth passes at an angle

540
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,500
of course that's a with working with

541
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:02,648
Road out

542
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,259
Rodale and Bill when Bill first started

543
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:06,729
with organic of course we try to you

544
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:08,829
always try to roll at an angle that you

545
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:13,419
planted you're trying to overlap that

546
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:15,548
row of rye in to the next and so on so

547
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,750
it's covering between the rows where you

548
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:19,269
drilled so you're not trying to leave

549
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,220
any gaps at all I wasn't sure if that's

550
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:23,919
you talk that gets a whole lot of talk

551
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,690
but that's a one of it's one way we can

552
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,769
do it and it seems to work well it seems

553
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,629
to overlap doesn't leave to seem to

554
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,399
leave any gaps and provide some pretty

555
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:32,829
good coverage you can see that that

556
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:34,148
rolling was working pretty well you know

557
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:35,500
I tell you that tractor what's covered

558
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:37,148
up in pollen that's that's the right

559
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,638
that was the right timing I had to

560
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:41,278
change the filter covers many a time

561
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:45,250
because the tractor was getting too hot

562
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,750
but so the biomass 5,000 6,000 pounds

563
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,398
you know you can hope for eight nine

564
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,960
thousand but if you're in five to six

565
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,308
you're pretty comfortable I believe this

566
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,929
was I think between four and five

567
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,339
thousand we still decided to give it a

568
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:58,000
try it did lay over nice it looked like

569
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:59,829
it was heavy I guess a few issues with

570
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,440
that we had with it though the field

571
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:05,678
that it's all about may be your last

572
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,058
operation the previous season if you you

573
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,129
know if the what you've done before you

574
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:10,509
know it'll haunt you later on the field

575
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:10,839
maybe wasn't as smooth as it needed to

576
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:13,240
be

577
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,619
since the Rye was pretty thick and it

578
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,419
was it could be tough for the drill

579
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,128
dough to puncture through that biomass

580
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:19,990
but if you have gaps you have little

581
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:21,428
dips and divots and things like that

582
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,628
well the see might just be dropped right

583
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:23,860
on the surface if the field wasn't

584
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:26,709
smooth enough smooth enough you didn't

585
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:28,990
have that contact with the drill to open

586
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,850
that slot to drop the the soybean in and

587
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,929
then it just left it on the surface some

588
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:33,609
fields it seemed to do better than

589
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:35,740
others we're not sure why exactly but

590
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:37,979
that was a little bit of our experience

591
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,980
there

592
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:47,930
okay well should we just open for a few

593
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,160
questions or or does anybody have any

594
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:53,990
questions so far I should probably ask

595
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:56,269
that five ten minutes ago with or I

596
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,009
actually we have I'm gonna skip right to

597
00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:00,410
it right now we tried we actually tried

598
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:03,859
a little bout of no-till corn we put

599
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:06,890
some please clover and rye in and had a

600
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:11,419
nice stand of here's here's a picture of

601
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:15,290
that but we I think we in the thrown

602
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:17,450
about 50 bushels of corn we actually did

603
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,990
not apply any other nutrients other than

604
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:24,830
we saw addressed with about 50 piles of

605
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,910
organic nitrogen and I'm not sure what

606
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:28,669
would have happened we had a beautiful

607
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,460
stand of corn we planted in 230 thousand

608
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:33,200
and their fertilizer camp

609
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,059
company came down checked and I think we

610
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,680
got twenty nine thousand plants but they

611
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,379
just I don't think they had enough

612
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,110
nutrients on it I won maybe one reason

613
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,000
for that it's it's still all speculation

614
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,469
we didn't have to take any samples we

615
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,269
were just had a busy year we were just

616
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,549
trying something to see what you know

617
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:50,480
see what would happen and you know see

618
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:51,950
if there was some merit to it and I

619
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,960
still think we still think there is but

620
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,549
we think sense basically going from a

621
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,559
conventional tillage system directly

622
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:00,079
into a no-till there's I think there's

623
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,809
some issues with your soil ecology soil

624
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:05,779
microbiology that just switching gears

625
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:07,460
immediately even with a good cover crop

626
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,740
a lot of biomass that's so that's the

627
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,150
picture on the right there that's it's a

628
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,370
lot of it's a good biomass with the Rye

629
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,400
and there was seem like there was a fair

630
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:18,919
amount of pee and a lot of clover mixed

631
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,390
in there but of course that a lot of

632
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,779
that material stays on the surface and

633
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:25,910
if you just don't have the the soil

634
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:28,789
structure and things working for you

635
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:31,269
underneath the ground I think with like

636
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:33,920
with a long term minimum tiller or

637
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:36,259
no-till situation you just you don't

638
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,430
have that capacity to keep that crop

639
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:38,750
growing I think we just ran out of

640
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,049
nutrients we just ran out of some

641
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,049
fertility

642
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,759
we a try there or not le yes Missy

643
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:49,979
underage though was a little too narrow

644
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,839
yeah it was tying up early because you

645
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,089
lose your corn yield is determined so

646
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,970
early with these new varieties you can

647
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:58,199
tolerate that early depression even if

648
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:04,950
you have plenty of that the rest of the

649
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:07,620
year that will be my guess yeah actually

650
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,319
makes some mixtures for just this

651
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,569
problem okay where he tries to remove

652
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,859
the grass and get the CN ratio narrower

653
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:18,929
as a way to make sure the corn is well

654
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:22,259
we know that Steve mirskiy has been

655
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,060
working on a awry vetch mixture and the

656
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,009
ratios play chutes the planting ratios

657
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,720
and seeing out how it turns out finding

658
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,190
that sweet spot where it gives you some

659
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,110
lasting coverage for weed suppression

660
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,809
but gives you the nitrogen that you're

661
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:41,879
looking for try to find that Goldilocks

662
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:44,039
scenario trying to reduce the amount of

663
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,360
grass right yes we try to minimize that

664
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:53,389
as much as possible all right good maybe

665
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,389
two more questions another question yes

666
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:06,410
well any any slugs with us the soybeans

667
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:13,059
on the bat Motel mulch yes they like

668
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:15,860
that you know that's one thing that

669
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:19,970
depending on your hiding you're allowed

670
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:21,829
to use slowly in an organic system using

671
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:25,339
some babies but made in an organic

672
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:28,480
system and that's a problem I will have

673
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:28,480
to pick your brain about that cloth

674
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,100
but we have like

675
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:59,140
but smoke devastated conventional

676
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:15,540
right very good

677
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:17,610
well that wraps it up all thank you this
