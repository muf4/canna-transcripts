1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,399
University so I'm here to talk to

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,718
everybody about inoculum feses inoculum

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,599
uh which is a pretty basic part of all

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:17,879
the experiments but I'm going to make

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,960
the argument it's a pretty important

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,679
part um and so yeah that the title is

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,160
does an oculum history and preparation

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,198
affect pathogenicity but to to explain

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,679
it a little bit clearer um when we're

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,519
talking about phop infest we're

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,598
investigating phop in

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,238
is does does the substrate that we grow

14
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:38,078
and harvest the sper that we use for

15
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,280
inoculum um does that substrate uh

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,320
affect the disease that's caused

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Downstream in the experiments why does

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,679
it really affect the disease phenotype

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:49,119
that we get from this um and so the

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,920
reason this is an issue the reason that

21
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,439
I I thought this would be worth

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,760
investigating uh is that you know among

23
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,839
among the community among those of us

24
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,920
that study phop infests um there's not a

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
lot of

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,920
standardization

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,319
uh the the way in which it's grown the

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,400
sub that it's grown is pretty variable

29
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,438
um you can have it grown on live tissue

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,520
generally on attached leaflets which is

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,158
how you like to do it in the fry lab it

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,840
can be grown in pure culture on a whole

33
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,000
bunch of different Aug media um and then

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,079
resulting from this variation you often

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,359
get these really disperate uh

36
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,319
concentrations used for oculum for for

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,200
spraying plants or inoculating you know

38
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,319
individual pieces of tissue uh all the

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,118
way from 300 spr inine per M to up of

40
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,519
150,000 SP which is which is a lot um

41
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:39,280
and and this comes up so this is a

42
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:42,118
fairly recent paper out of our lab um

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,000
and and paa in this paper uh was using

44
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,000
inoculum derived from leaflets from

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,879
attach leaflets how we generally do it

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,319
in our lab um and and she said that she

47
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,000
wanted to use it uh coming from Leets

48
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,279
because it would more closely represent

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,680
the unoc that we would see in the field

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,399
and an actual infection coming from

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,719
other plants that's what we see right it

52
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,320
doesn't come from cultures in the field

53
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:03,118
and and and that's generally the

54
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,478
rationale used when we're trying to

55
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,920
decide if we're going to use it from

56
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,560
from leaflets and she used it at about

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,038
4,000 spr per Mill which is what we've

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,878
been using things at in the lab recently

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,159
but this is while this makes a lot of

60
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,639
sense to me and this is how I've done

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,519
all my experiments that this certainly

62
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,199
isn't the it's not the standard it's not

63
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,400
the rule um up here this is actually the

64
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,518
most recently published paper on phyo

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,680
infests on on the internet at least

66
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,000
right this came out last week uh they

67
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,920
got their inoculum from uh R

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,039
agricultures from Pure culture um and

69
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,639
they you know they wash the spring from

70
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,959
the culture and and they actually use

71
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,679
concentrations very similar to what we

72
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,878
use about 4,000 spr per M but if you

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,920
look at another paper this is from

74
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,840
2008 these folks again washed their

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,158
spania from Pure cultures from AR

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,000
cultures but they inoculated their

77
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:54,679
plants at 150,000 spania per me which is

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,759
uh that sprang supension of distilled

79
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,360
water it looks like milk it's it's

80
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,318
cloudy with spri it's a it's an

81
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,159
astronomical amount of binocul it's it's

82
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,719
crazy

83
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,399
um you often get concentrations in the

84
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,919
50 to 60,000 range these guys washed it

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,080
from Leaf tissue from actual sporulating

86
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,679
tissue that's generally if you wash a

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,680
moist Chambers wor tissue this is the

88
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,640
concentration you get Falcon tube it

89
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,239
makes sense um but all the way at the

90
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,000
low end of the spectrum this is a much

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,200
older paper they were using 300 sprain

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,360
to inoculate plants in high tunnels

93
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,199
actually uh so there's this huge

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,400
variation just to try and get disease um

95
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,598
and so that I mean that in itself should

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
should say something that there's I mean

97
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,039
this this can't not be causing anything

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,480
right when you've got I mean know a

99
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,598
difference of a thousand times in the

100
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,639
amount of concentration and and so we

101
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,000
have other evidence to actually back up

102
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,639
that that the way that we get our our

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,519
anoc the substrate that it came off of

104
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,598
um has a big impact on things so this is

105
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,799
uh some data from uh a recent study some

106
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,479
recent work that was done on arachadonic

107
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,239
acid um conferring resistance phenotype

108
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,000
of potatoes right so if you treat some

109
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,480
potatoes with ronic acid and you have

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,799
untreated um controls and then you apply

111
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,399
phop Fest inoc to them right you get a

112
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,199
really notable difference in disease

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,358
expression right so so for this

114
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,560
experiment it was taken from Pure

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,039
culture it was washed from ryag and you

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,280
know they they inoculated and assess

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,759
disease and if you did this experiment

118
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,079
and you got these results and it was you

119
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,840
know repeated and in a well set up study

120
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,839
you would probably make the assumption I

121
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,359
think you would rightfully make the

122
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,679
assumtion that yeah wow we have a

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,800
phenotype this really really does

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,319
something but if you repeat the same

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,840
experiment down to the T the only

126
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,399
difference being that our inoculum of

127
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,319
the same isolate now has come from

128
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,359
sporulating plant material instead of

129
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,000
coming from a pure culture that

130
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,520
phenotype we saw before is essentially

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,639
gone you could not draw the same

132
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,680
conclusions from this experiment as you

133
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,240
could from the one before and the only

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,199
thing that's different here is is how we

135
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,519
got our spanga right and so I I think

136
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,560
that it's a really important thing to be

137
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,918
considered and it can often be

138
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,879
overlooked in these these experiments

139
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,599
and so really my hypothesis that I'm I'm

140
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,800
looking at for this whole thing is that

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
the the substrate that phytop infest is

142
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,160
grown on and that this bres is collected

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,639
from really does induce some kind of

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,919
significant change to this bres an epic

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,400
change dis spria and then that change

146
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,599
then affects the disease Downstream the

147
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,239
the the disease that we get in the

148
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,600
experiments we use this in UL

149
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,560
before and so how do we look into this

150
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,520
it's most simp Le um you know we compare

151
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,439
the inoculum of some isolated photo

152
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,318
infests uh grown in pure culture and

153
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,959
grown on you know live tissue Leaf

154
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,039
tissue and do an inoculation experiment

155
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,198
with it and see how the disease

156
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,399
progresses you know I mean not not

157
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,038
particularly complicated right and so

158
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,439
the dline of the product the way that it

159
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,360
followed is really kind of the way that

160
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,079
we the way that we planned it and

161
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,639
executed it and so the the really the

162
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,198
first goal is

163
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
to do an inoculation experiment and

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,160
actually confirm that there really is a

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,280
fenic difference between inoculum that

166
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,599
we Source from actual plant material

167
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,399
inoc that we Source from Pure culture um

168
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,598
and that's you know just done by

169
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,239
assessing the overall disease that right

170
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,560
and then I really wanted to look into

171
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,160
the Le behind this try and look at the

172
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,439
the genetic differences that's going on

173
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,599
here to try and and you know maybe see

174
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,079
why we're seeing this difference um and

175
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,319
so the the big component of that was a

176
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,318
total gene expression in tomato tissue

177
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,360
right when when I do these infection

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,680
studies I can sample tissue on a Time

179
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,280
course and then extract the RNA out of

180
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,160
that tissue and that tissue has uh post

181
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,038
gene expression right to gene expression

182
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,240
and Pho the gene expression within it

183
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,079
and so I can look at the interaction

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,360
that's going on um but then actually as

185
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,680
the experiment came together and and we

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
didn't more thinking about it it became

187
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,560
apparent that actually the gene

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
expression within that inoculum itself

189
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,439
the the stuff that are we spraying on

190
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,279
the plants is really important to just

191
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,680
the just the pure concentrated inocent

192
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,758
coming from uh pure culture and coming

193
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,840
from sporulating uh live tissue and so

194
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,439
um looking into the gene expression

195
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,839
metan ulum became a really important

196
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,319
part of the experiment so the first part

197
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,758
is actually assessing assessing these

198
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,919
anoc sources right actually looking at

199
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,919
the difference uh and so the the

200
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,000
considerations that I wanted to really

201
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,959
keep in mind while I was planning the

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,439
experiment um was I wanted to use more

203
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,519
than one isolate of photo infests uh and

204
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,918
I didn't want it just be you know a

205
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,399
fluke just some artifact that only one

206
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,399
isolate was was representing um but

207
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,239
those isolates had to all be within the

208
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,719
same clonal lineage clonal lineages of

209
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,918
pH talk feses are are pretty diverse

210
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,479
they have different infection rates they

211
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,639
have different preferences they they

212
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,719
they behave differently so they had to

213
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,598
be within the same

214
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
clage um I wanted to keep it consistent

215
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,639
so I I wanted all my material to come

216
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,120
from uh phop was collected in New York

217
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,120
state on tomatoes I was going to do the

218
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,918
experiment in tomatoes and so I I just

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,959
wanted to keep that consistent and then

220
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,439
I really wanted to keep an eye on

221
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,918
inoculum concentration we saw that

222
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,360
there's a huge variation in inoculum

223
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,719
concentration and change in

224
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,720
concentration really can impact the way

225
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
that the disease goes forward so I

226
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,400
wanted to make sure it was pretty

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,919
consistent so the two isolates that I

228
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:13,638
ended up using um for this experiment

229
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,478
were both us 23s the first one which you

230
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,840
can see on the top here um I referred to

231
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,878
as New York Valley and I referred to as

232
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,959
New York Valley for the rest of the

233
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,840
experiment simply because it was

234
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,959
collected from New York Valley um it

235
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,478
came in as a disease sample to be uh

236
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,318
checked for you know clonal lineage to

237
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,799
be um uh identified by our was sent to

238
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,719
Kev um it came in just this past summer

239
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,519
last June uh truly less than weeks

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,159
before I used it in the experiment it

241
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,000
was really really fresh from the field

242
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,439
um and to to support this experiment I

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,919
selected an isolate called 14112 that's

244
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,320
just their lab nomenclature it's how we

245
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,240
keep track of our isolates it was also

246
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
you know a us23 collected from tomato in

247
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,000
New York state almost exactly a year

248
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
before we got Newark Valley so it had

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,200
been kept the way that we keep all our

250
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
cultures uh lab you know on ryag or

251
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,839
transferred

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,079
periodically so with my two starting

253
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,560
cultures 14112 which is in it in its

254
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:12,278
plate and storage medium in New York

255
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,879
Valley and off of a off of a field

256
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,360
sample uh they had to be transferred you

257
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,039
know to to the differential media right

258
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,039
so 14112 I needed growing on in pure

259
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,278
culture and on leaflets and New York

260
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,480
Valley I needed growing in pure culture

261
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:29,039
and on leaflets um but this first step

262
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,159
here is actually no trivial task as

263
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,120
anybody who's worked with phyo uh can

264
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,078
attest to and and as Bill said you know

265
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,399
something that I struggled with as an

266
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:40,679
undergraduate before I came here

267
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:44,039
significantly um primarily this step and

268
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,879
this step getting Storage phop off of

269
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,919
you know a slow growing media onto

270
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,559
leaflets is not um it's not as simple as

271
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,759
just you know putting an Cube on and

272
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,958
letting it go it actually is is a a bit

273
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,240
of bit of work to get it going and

274
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,439
especially you know we've only got maybe

275
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,759
one or two plates in storage we don't

276
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,680
have a lot of plates to make bunch of

277
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,000
binocul sprad leaves uh and and this is

278
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,639
a non non-trivial task too getting it

279
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,360
actually from a field isolate into

280
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,879
culture if you just you know bring a

281
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,278
piece of of tissue over you end up with

282
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,958
contamination and all sorts of local

283
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,000
things we have to use you know argor

284
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,838
cubes and actually transfer spenia and

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
and I really have to give all the thanks

286
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,839
for this to Kev he Kev processed all

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,639
these samples and he really got

288
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,480
everything going which is wonderful so

289
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,319
after I get these going this is can be

290
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,120
thought of as like a lab St I don't want

291
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,000
to use that as the first source of an

292
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,759
because

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
it's it's just been transferred Ares and

294
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,919
stuff in and these are transferred out

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,399
to their equivalent media one time and

296
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,278
then this is the inoculum source for the

297
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,839
first field of trial so I had field

298
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,559
trials and lab trials because when we

299
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,240
look at phop therea infection

300
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,799
experiments there are field trials right

301
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,399
where people spray plants on in a farm

302
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,958
setting and there are lots and lots of

303
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,159
lab experiments with individual leaflets

304
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,399
and so I had roughly five trials going

305
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,199
on and I need a lot of inoculum so the

306
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
inoculum was prepared on their

307
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,040
respective plates and leaf

308
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,320
and then flooded from their source and

309
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,958
used as inoculum in the field and it was

310
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,120
also used to inoculate the next

311
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,838
generation of inoculum dur the next

312
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,759
trial um so after it was washed I

313
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,399
adjusted the concentration to 5,000

314
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,720
Spang per Mill which is pretty similar

315
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,159
to what other experiments we were using

316
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,360
the lab was it was the same

317
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,958
concentrations I was using for other

318
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,759
experiments that was doing the time um

319
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,679
the Brandi are incubated in in the

320
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,919
fridge for half an hour to promote

321
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,519
germination in zo for release uh because

322
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,319
that really helps with getting infection

323
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,159
later down the road and then after they

324
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,959
had germinated I put them back on the

325
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,480
hemocytometer under the microscope to

326
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,638
double check concentration I really

327
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,120
wanted to make sure the concentrations

328
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,720
are all the same uh but also to assess

329
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
germination I wanted to make sure that

330
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
you know I wasn't seeing that the lethal

331
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,440
driv R were all germinating happily and

332
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,680
lots of Ze being released and the plate

333
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,880
ones had just not germinated that that

334
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,919
that in itself could be causing a

335
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,919
difference and and luckily actually um

336
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,639
there wasn't much of a difference they

337
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,838
were all happily germinating it was was

338
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,480
really nice um so then those suspensions

339
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,320
were put into an aerosol sprayer just

340
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,278
like this one um and brought to the

341
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,879
field or into the lab to inoculate my

342
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:10,360
plants so I used five Ms total of that

343
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,320
concentration in the field plots because

344
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,600
they were multipl plots were big and

345
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
only a mill for the lab experiments

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,000
because they were just plates right

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,320
there most small so it was the same

348
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,720
amount of material basically per per

349
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,160
Leaf it was I calculated that that way

350
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,278
um so for the experiments I had two

351
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,078
field trials that were done at the farm

352
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,720
down in Freeville uh this past summer

353
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,078
um the two trials were comprised of

354
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,720
three blocks each randomized complete

355
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,519
blocks and there was uh essentially 10

356
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,600
treatments and we can think of it as

357
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,759
five treatments doubled um and those

358
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,199
treatments were a water control right to

359
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,240
make sure that you know I had a healthy

360
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:51,719
PL reference 14112 the older isolate

361
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,680
from leaflets 14112 from Pure culture

362
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,240
Newark Valley the newer isolate from the

363
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,958
it's a newor Valley from Pure culture

364
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,680
those are my four different inoculum

365
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,599
types along with water and the reason

366
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,278
that the treatments were doubled it was

367
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,159
been duplicate was because I was

368
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,639
collecting tissue at a time course at 12

369
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,439
and 60 hours after inoculation for later

370
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,360
R sequencing and I wanted to sample

371
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,199
destructively right I didn't want to be

372
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,560
harvesting tissue from a tomato waiting

373
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,120
a couple days and then pulling it again

374
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,359
I didn't want to you know change

375
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,799
expression that way so everything was

376
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,240
done in duplicat so I could do one plot

377
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,679
once and one plot at a time and then all

378
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,440
the plants were assessed for disease at

379
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,838
144 hours that's when they were really

380
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,760
sporulating disease was noticeable and

381
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,000
and and reasonable to assess uh this is

382
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,838
just a layout of one of my field trials

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,078
you can see three blocks the randomized

384
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,399
treatments over there um so like I said

385
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,039
there was two of those and they were

386
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,480
done a week apart and they were planted

387
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,639
independently they were inoculated

388
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,240
independently with the wrong mind it was

389
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,639
really two different

390
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,440
experiments um the lab Trials of which I

391
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,959
had three were set up in a very similar

392
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,839
way I inoculated uh detached leaflets

393
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,319
and moist Chambers again with the

394
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,800
sprayer it had the same treatments um it

395
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,839
was again done a duplicate so I opened a

396
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,559
plate harvested and I didn't have to

397
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,160
open that plate again because the

398
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,958
changes in humidity and can change

399
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,958
things again and just like the field

400
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,919
plants there assessed at 144 hours after

401
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:11,719
enaculation for

402
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:15,278
disease so what did I

403
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,320
see so for the field trials at 72 hours

404
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,720
after immaculation I actually um went

405
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,240
out and pulled the plants I dug them up

406
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,320
and I put them in big clop plastic trash

407
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,278
bags with uh wet Pap towels to keep them

408
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,240
humanid I would have loved to have uh

409
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,639
you know left the plants in the field

410
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,560
and let them spoil a naturally but you

411
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,959
know this is a working farm it was early

412
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:36,439
in the season and I didn't want to be

413
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,599
this huge source of binocul for

414
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,240
everybody doing trials around and I mean

415
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,278
I myself had invested interest in it

416
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,839
after the first run uh I had my second

417
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:45,439
experiment to be done the next week you

418
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,480
know right next door so if these SP in

419
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,279
the field that was going to cause

420
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
problems so I I I bagged them and

421
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,679
brought them into the lab where they

422
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
were kept at you know room temperature

423
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,638
until 144 hours with they were set um to

424
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,039
just let those spil it

425
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,879
out and so I took cuttings from the

426
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,360
plants they were quite large plants they

427
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,919
they took ter terrible pictures this

428
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,159
whole so I just sort of flop the top off

429
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,078
to take these pictures for you guys um

430
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,958
and so here we have a plant that was

431
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,758
inoculated with inoculum from New York

432
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,039
Valley that was grown up on plates and a

433
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,320
plant that was inoculated with New York

434
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,480
Valley that was grown up on grees you

435
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,600
can actually turn these lights

436
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,920
off I don't have the slightest idea to

437
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,920
do it

438
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,079
there excellent thank you very much

439
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,319
there we go so we can see much better so

440
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:34,078
so inoculated from plates are inoculated

441
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:36,120
from leaves um and they're just a a you

442
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,719
know a sample of the plant and so you

443
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,000
can't see it with great detail but um

444
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,120
the the disease on the Newark Valley

445
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,839
plate is significantly less than on the

446
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,720
leaf this was rated around 20% whereas

447
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,519
this was was much much higher the

448
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
differences are even more exaggerated

449
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,519
though uh when we look at the older isol

450
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,040
14012 so this plant was inoculated with

451
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,440
drive from the plate and you can almost

452
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,599
not see the distance there a discret

453
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
legion here and there a lesions within

454
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,240
the leaves but as compared to its

455
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,679
leaflet derived cousin I mean the

456
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,959
disease on this is pretty significant

457
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,479
it's it's really plants were were really

458
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,078
really heavily

459
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,079
diseased um the lab trials were assessed

460
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,000
very much the same way I uh I assess

461
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:18,318
them 144 hours and I took pictures

462
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,639
although actually pictures you guys are

463
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:24,078
about to see are photos taken 168 hours

464
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,879
the first run of photos I took um for

465
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,719
actually the first two runs uh were just

466
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,000
like this the top of the moist chamber

467
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,199
was on top of them and uh I realized

468
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,639
actually luckily after the second lab

469
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,719
trial when I looked at them on my

470
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,000
computer you couldn't see anything I saw

471
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,240
it when I did the assessments because I

472
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,839
opened them up the pictures were not

473
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,480
good so I quickly noticed that I had a

474
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,639
problem luckily I saved all the plates

475
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,920
and so the next day I just opened them

476
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,560
up and have much better pictures so

477
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,278
these the the disease you'll see in the

478
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,799
pictures is a little bit higher than

479
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,519
they so in the same order we've got our

480
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,359
Newark Valley playr and a nework valley

481
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
Leaf

482
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,318
D and you can see uh the New York Valley

483
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,440
plate deres are quite a bit h the nework

484
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,558
valley leaf and if you can't see because

485
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,880
the resolution isn't so great if we zoom

486
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,240
in the the New York Valley plate the

487
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,959
there quite a bit of healthy tissue

488
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,000
still and the tissue is still rigid um

489
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,880
though it is sporulating it's it's it's

490
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
still quite intact whereas the leaflet

491
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,439
deriv is completely water soaked you

492
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,279
couldn't pick these leaves up they would

493
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
just disintegrate and it's absolutely

494
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,000
covered in in

495
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,839
spoilation I don't know I don't know how

496
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,839
to do

497
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,839
oh there we go excellent so yeah so if

498
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,480
you can see this tissue is just

499
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,038
completely covered ination this is

500
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,000
plenty of healthy tissue um but the

501
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,798
difference is again even more magnified

502
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,119
when we look at the older isol 14112 and

503
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:52,480
and and actually if you'll notice the

504
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,719
overall disease is a bit magnified in

505
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,440
these lab experiments these moist

506
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,960
Chambers are you know ideal conditions

507
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,279
for sporulation so the differences kind

508
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,759
of get a bit exaggerated but so if we

509
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,359
zoom in again on the 14112 isolates the

510
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,440
the plate there inoculum it it's

511
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,519
essentially healthy tissue and this

512
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,679
plate there was one discrete Legion that

513
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,879
you can let me barely make out of the

514
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,640
projector here right there as compared

515
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,360
to the leaflet derived at the same

516
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,240
concentration I mean it's completely

517
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:21,158
water soaked completely covered in

518
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,159
spoilation so there was a really really

519
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
notable difference in

520
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,798
disease uh and so if I uh just

521
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,720
accumulate the averages across my of of

522
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,038
these disease ratings so for the field

523
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,200
trials um obviously we had no disease in

524
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,558
the water controls and if you look at

525
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,558
within the New York Valley the leaflet

526
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,599
derived mum was on average 40 and 30%

527
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,678
respectively for the two trials as

528
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,480
compared to 15 and 10 for this plate

529
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,159
derived uh version and the same pattern

530
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,120
held true with 1.12 the older isolate

531
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,360
the leaf deriv inoculum was in the 50s

532
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,158
for disease and the plate derve inoculum

533
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,599
was down in single digits as far as a

534
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,799
dis it was really notable difference um

535
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,240
and if you're wondering about these

536
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,879
averages about how consistent it was

537
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,599
across the the the Reps so these are all

538
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,200
the assessments and you can see this is

539
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,399
within trial two you can see the numbers

540
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,640
are quite the same all across it was

541
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
really really

542
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,320
consistent uh the lab trials was exactly

543
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,079
the same way although a bit more

544
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:21,200
exaggerated because of the the nature of

545
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,399
these these lab inoculations um the

546
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,558
water controls were clean the nework

547
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,559
valley Leaf resulted in in about 80%

548
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,599
disease at 144 hours as compared to its

549
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,079
plate derived in which only resulted in

550
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,439
about 30% and then again more

551
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,798
exaggerated with a 112 the leaflet

552
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,798
derived was around 90% disease as

553
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,839
compared to single digits um so it was a

554
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:43,158
was a

555
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,918
really significant difference and all

556
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,480
these assessments and inoculations I I

557
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,720
purposely I did them blind I had a

558
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,798
number system that was just randomized I

559
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,279
didn't know what I was spraying on what

560
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,679
and I didn't know what I was assessing

561
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,038
and so I have a big notebook page all

562
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,600
filled with these numbers that I wrote

563
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,839
down directly and then after I collected

564
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,639
all the data I went through with a with

565
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:05,119
highlighters colorcoded and set it up

566
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,679
and just this pattern showed up and I'm

567
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,319
sure bill has an email somewhere and his

568
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,280
inbox of me just being ecstatic at two

569
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,240
in the morning one did it it just Fallen

570
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:15,678
together so so beautifully it was really

571
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,679
exciting so after I had these very

572
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,200
promising results from the phenotypic

573
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,759
analysis I wanted to move on to the gene

574
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,600
expression it's actually looking what

575
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,038
was behind this um so I've discussed the

576
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,759
tissue collection you know I sampled in

577
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,200
the field immediately froze everything

578
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,720
at all the time points um and that was

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,080
brought back to the lab for total RNA

580
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,400
extraction so for the for the um

581
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,678
infected tissue I had you know tomato

582
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,280
host gene expression with the phytoene

583
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,240
expression mixed in um and from those I

584
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,678
prepared my libraries for cdna uh for

585
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,319
RNA um sequencing um to do the RNA

586
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,759
sequencing and then I I also did some

587
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,240
real time to to just try and get a

588
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,879
handle on on what was going on in these

589
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,400
samples so for an overview of all the

590
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,679
samples that I collected and of all the

591
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,880
all the all the samples that I prepared

592
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,840
sequencing um this is the first field

593
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,080
trial you can see the three blocks two

594
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:09,519
time points and treatments within them

595
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,678
um 112 pnl being 112 plate derived and

596
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,359
112 leaflet derived in the same thing

597
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,798
Valley plate and leaflet derived um so

598
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,000
there were two field trials with three

599
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,839
blocks each although I lost one of the

600
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,079
blocks um to disease it was it was

601
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,480
really close to a joining field that had

602
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,639
disease I didn't really see disease in

603
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,079
it but I called it just to be on the

604
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
safe side I didn't I didn't want to have

605
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,000
any chance of of unexpected

606
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,880
contamination I have my three lab trials

607
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,720
which were all done independently

608
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,919
through the same setup and

609
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,400
then these samples have become really

610
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,240
important as the the uh experiment has

611
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,759
has moved on these are just the inoculum

612
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,359
so just spanga collected from one for

613
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,480
a12 in plate or one one for a12 in leaf

614
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,199
and the same from the New York Valley in

615
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,000
plate and leaf it's it's not not

616
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,720
infected anything it's not been spread

617
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,759
anything it's just the the concentrated

618
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,798
spanga collected from these different

619
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:05,278
inoculum sources that I was working on

620
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,400
um so the again the RNA was there for

621
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:10,960
RNA sequencing for

622
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,080
time um because I have so many samples

623
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,278
uh these cdna libraries became a really

624
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,720
really non-trivial test right of all the

625
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:21,200
RNA that you extract from a sample um

626
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,839
quite a bit of it the majority of it is

627
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,558
going to be ribosomal RNA which I'm not

628
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,038
interested in for my differential

629
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,879
expression um and so of that fraction of

630
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,359
that that's going to be useful messenger

631
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,360
RNA only a small fraction of that in my

632
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,479
tissue samples is going to be phyo RNA

633
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,399
right the vast majority by weight is

634
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,360
going to be tomato uh and so so really

635
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,880
getting good CD libraries was important

636
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,879
and I actually the solutions that I

637
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,278
ended up using um I actually just think

638
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,480
is really interesting so I tell you

639
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:50,880
about it so it exploited the fact that

640
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,480
messenger RNA has a poly dentil tail um

641
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,200
and so you can use ferite beads that

642
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,200
have a probe that Associates with that

643
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,000
tail and then uh once your is associated

644
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,519
with these beads you can just apply a

645
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,079
magnet and wash everything else away uh

646
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,319
and so all you're left with is your your

647
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,960
mRNA that you're interested in working

648
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,558
with it's very efficient at getting rid

649
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,679
of all that ribosome RNA and it gave me

650
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,480
the best chance of actually getting my

651
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,960
small fraction that is phy RNA um and

652
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,519
then it's all nice and bound up so you

653
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,798
can chop it up with starters and

654
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,879
Stoppers into small fragments useful for

655
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,240
sequencing and produce you double

656
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,880
stranded libraries and then associate

657
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,960
barcodes because I did a fair amount of

658
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,600
Multiplex I have a little over a 100

659
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,798
samples so Multiplex became really

660
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,158
important for me to be able to run more

661
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:38,000
than one sample in a lane so I could

662
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,919
actually look at all of my samples um

663
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,558
now unfortunately because of some

664
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,679
holdups with the sequencing my RNA

665
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,440
libraries are currently uh waiting to be

666
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,440
processed at Wild Cornell down in New

667
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,840
York City um so I haven't been able to

668
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,400
do my RNA cing analysis for you guys yet

669
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,798
but um I certainly couldn't wait that

670
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,120
long to be able to look into what was

671
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,599
going on so I uh

672
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,439
set out to do a whole bunch of real-time

673
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,038
PCR I I just wanted to get some sort of

674
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,120
an insight into what was going on with

675
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,919
my

676
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:13,278
samples um so uh I made RNA from the the

677
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,640
total RNA extracted from my my field

678
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,558
samples um there was no RAB exclusion or

679
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,400
anything it was just just all the RNA

680
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:22,399
that I had was made in the cdna so I

681
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,798
could do real time on it uh for tomato I

682
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,840
I looked at a handful of genes I had

683
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,000
elongation Factor mostly as a as a

684
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,720
normalizer as a reference it's a

685
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,359
housekeeping Gene it's good it's a good

686
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,000
way to to to normalize my my we back um

687
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,278
and then I had kai3 and st2 kai3 is just

688
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,679
a kitase and st2 is a generic

689
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,119
pathogenesis related Gene and tomato um

690
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm not expecting them to have a a

691
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,798
direct relationship to the phyo

692
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,359
infection but they they can give an

693
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:47,839
overview of of how the plant is

694
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,678
responding to to an infection I just

695
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,519
wanted to a little window into how the

696
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,200
tomato is behaving for phop Fest I

697
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,278
normalize everything back to its which

698
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,558
is just a transcribed spacer it's a good

699
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:01,000
normalizer because it's not really

700
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,200
differentially regulated um I looked at

701
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,359
an ATP binding Gene uh ative rxlr that

702
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,600
we've looked at a number of studies it's

703
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:10,879
just a really up regulated effector at

704
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:13,319
early stages of disease um and inf1

705
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,159
which is an elicitin which is adversely

706
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,918
really upregulated at late levels of

707
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,679
disease I thought I was hoping it would

708
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,520
give me a good insight to what was going

709
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,519
on so this is just an example of one of

710
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,759
the real-time runs that I did um this

711
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,639
was on 60h hour Leaf tissue um that had

712
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,319
been inoculated ated with

713
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,320
14112 uh from plate leaflet and and the

714
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,839
water control uh this was a lab

715
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,240
experiment so there was a really big

716
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,918
difference between uh the

717
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,759
two and um when we look at the Tomato

718
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,399
jeans uh there's really no difference

719
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,000
they they the tomatoes aren't acting

720
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:50,599
differently at 60 hours when this was

721
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,398
harvested um we have to remember that

722
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,519
we're I mean we're more than 60 hours

723
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,359
away from my assessment so so we're

724
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,759
quite a ways off from actual disease the

725
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,639
to the tissue is green and healthy uh it

726
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:05,038
doesn't really look like it's diseased

727
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,360
um and I wasn't actually super surprised

728
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,119
by this that they're not really acting

729
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,558
differently especially the plate dve one

730
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,439
because that one by4 hours it was barely

731
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,759
diseased

732
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,519
toway if we looked at the phyo

733
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,038
expression though at first glance it

734
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,440
looks like there's a difference I mean

735
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,158
that there are differences in expression

736
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,880
um but I think that this can actually be

737
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,080
explained in in a different way um so

738
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,440
while the tomatoes were

739
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,678
indistinguishable the the phytop in

740
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,640
expression is is just sort of relative

741
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,320
to its its stage in its disease progress

742
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,120
not to its time point but how it's

743
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,439
progressing in disease and by by that I

744
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,278
mean if if I align the overall disease

745
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,080
that I ended up with with this exact

746
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,359
sample at 144 hours right the leaflet

747
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,319
derived one we ended up at 90%

748
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,839
diseas as compared to only 1% with the

749
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,038
plate derived one um so they're at very

750
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,199
different stages of of their

751
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:59,038
life and to to exaggerate that problem

752
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,000
right uh with the extraction with a real

753
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,480
time PCR there's a there's a detection

754
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,558
threshold right there has to be at least

755
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,480
a certain amount of material me to be

756
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,440
able to see it and and for the small

757
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,079
fraction of the RNA that phyo is going

758
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,480
to be it may very well be that you know

759
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,240
at this stage of disease there's just

760
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,319
not enough phora you know in the lower

761
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,880
disease I for me to really be able to

762
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,480
see

763
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,559
much so to put that more you know

764
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,278
graphically our our leaflet derived

765
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:32,798
plant at 60 hours um was pretty close to

766
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:34,480
as you know 60 hours after the sampling

767
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,759
time it was flating pretty

768
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,759
heavily whereas the plant inoculated

769
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:40,240
from plates you know 60 hours afterwards

770
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,720
was still a green and healthy plant at

771
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,440
144 hours it only had 1% disease but if

772
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,000
I let these plates go and and and

773
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,360
actually in most the experiments I did I

774
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,640
let them just keep running um you know

775
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,398
the 90% disease ones they didn't get any

776
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,919
worse they couldn't get any worse but by

777
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,839
a week later the plates that had only

778
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,000
you know 1% disease 5% disease at 144

779
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,199
hours had caught up the the disease had

780
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,640
spread and they were now terribly

781
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,200
infected so I I've just got this little

782
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,159
window into the overall disease and it's

783
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,000
just I'm just seeing expression relative

784
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,120
to that and

785
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,519
so while it was maybe a little bit

786
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,639
discouraging at least for the realtime

787
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,759
PCR um and I had to wait to really get

788
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,000
some insight into this until I could do

789
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,278
my R sequencing what it did do is is

790
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,839
redirect my focus it I had this these

791
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,440
spial isolates of just the spanga and

792
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,079
and I and I really thought that if I was

793
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,919
going to have any chance of seeing

794
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,519
actual differential expression different

795
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,038
things going on it was going to be in

796
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:39,558
those spria because I mean as we

797
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,640
discussed with the arachadonic acid

798
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,519
experiment I mean these frangia are

799
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,000
different somehow they behave

800
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,558
differently um and this is just an older

801
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,319
experiment uh from Mar back in 1999 um

802
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,759
it wasn't looking at inoculum sources it

803
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:55,720
was looking at uh spangel survival in

804
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,119
the face of solar radiation right so how

805
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,278
how well they survived in the Sun and if

806
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,398
the experiment was done with spranger

807
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:03,558
that came from Pure culture the results

808
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,079
were all over the place they didn't

809
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,960
survive very well and it wasn't very

810
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:10,079
reliable um but Eduardo who's doing the

811
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,798
the study noticed if he was using lethal

812
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,839
drives brania they survived much better

813
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:15,599
he got really reliable results and so

814
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,119
without even looking into it he he had

815
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,158
really noticed that these brania just on

816
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,398
their own were behaving quite

817
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,679
differently somehow they're surviving

818
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,678
differently so they're expressing things

819
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,440
differently so I refocused on this brang

820
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,720
and I I did some more realtime

821
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,798
PCR so I checked those genes that I was

822
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,640
talking about these are just their

823
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:33,440
expression levels normalized to the its

824
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,759
which I was talking about before and the

825
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,880
ATP binding cassette is is really uh in

826
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,480
phytop it's really reflective of of just

827
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,840
cellular activity when the phop is

828
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,079
really up and doing things and really

829
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,879
going you see more expression than when

830
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,839
it's Laten and the expression was not

831
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,200
different between the two of them this

832
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,439
brangio are expressing at the same

833
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,080
levels they're they're just BR right

834
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,360
they're waiting for the effect but when

835
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:58,199
I look at my rxlr my my effector um we

836
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,158
saw a fair difference in expression the

837
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,200
leaflet dpia had twofold expression

838
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,360
they're expressing it twice as much as

839
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,519
the plate dpia and then when I

840
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,759
investigated in1 that elicit tendance

841
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,200
associated with late stage disease the

842
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:15,599
difference was just astronomical so if

843
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,360
if we look at ratios here the the plate

844
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,038
derived spanga are expressing this

845
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,240
elican at at about a 100 times more than

846
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,558
their Leaf derived

847
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,000
um cousins um and I actually run this a

848
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,798
couple times you know on a couple

849
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,839
different RNA samples because I I was I

850
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,960
wanted to make sure that that sort of

851
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,319
was but the these ratios hold true um

852
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,960
and and the inf1 is is really

853
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,639
interesting in in this um so inf1 is is

854
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,519
like the primary secretor of listen in

855
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,360
phyto inest it's it's you know it's it's

856
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,038
it's talked about quite a lot it's

857
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:52,479
associated with uh late stage disease

858
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:55,519
inducing hypersensitive response um it's

859
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,120
not known to be the cause of resistance

860
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,079
to F infests in tomatoes or potatoes um

861
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,839
but it is likely the reason behind some

862
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,319
nonhost resistance and some tobacco and

863
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,359
some other plants like that it just it

864
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,439
induces this HR but in phop infests what

865
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,439
it is associated with is really high

866
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,038
expression um at late stages of

867
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,960
infection when the Tom when the the

868
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,960
tissue was neotic and it's sporulating

869
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,960
heavily and it's also Associated at

870
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,440
really high levels with culture growth

871
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,440
if you look at phyo growing in pure

872
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,759
culture because it's not growing on a

873
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,320
planet it doesn't have to worry about

874
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:27,278
you know listening responses uh it's it

875
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,879
it the pattern is is that it's really

876
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,558
highly Express

877
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,799
culture um it doesn't totally stop

878
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,440
expressing it when it's infecting at

879
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:38,798
early stages of infection if you look at

880
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,840
an an you know biotropic early phytop

881
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,079
growth it's still expressing this Gene

882
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:44,918
uh but it's at much much more down

883
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,839
regulated levels uh levels that were

884
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,200
more in line with my leaflet drives um

885
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,720
but I was a little concerned because

886
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,840
they they did say that in their

887
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,960
experiment it's just back in 1996 but

888
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:57,079
they didn't really see it in spanga um I

889
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,399
was worried that maybe it was some sort

890
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,918
of an artifact I was seeing it um so I

891
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:04,079
made sure that when I uh collected my

892
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,720
spria for RNA extraction I did it

893
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,480
exactly like they did in their in their

894
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,000
paper I washed it from the plates or

895
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,079
from the leaves just to make sure that I

896
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,398
wasn't you know picking up more my

897
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,000
ceiling than they were something like

898
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,398
that um and I did my RNA extractions

899
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,638
from those to run the realtime PCR and

900
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,479
and with my real time PCR you know I

901
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:21,038
checked with melting curves to make sure

902
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,558
that the the primers that I had designed

903
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,558
for this was getting exactly way it was

904
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,278
and and I I really really was if I had

905
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,440
to try to come up with some explanation

906
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,440
it may simply be that in 1996 with the

907
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,240
the r extraction protocols that we had

908
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,038
and they were using Northern blocks to

909
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
associate the genes um it might have

910
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,960
just been slightly below detectable

911
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,000
thresholds I'm not seeing tons of

912
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,120
transcripts of this Gene uh I'm just

913
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,599
seeing a differential expression between

914
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,719
the two of them and so the reason this

915
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:48,278
was exciting and the reason that again

916
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,639
you know I fired bill off a frantic

917
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:51,880
email at two in the morning with with

918
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:53,199
writing that was hard to understand

919
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,120
because I was I was so excited is

920
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,919
because if we look at the the overall

921
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,719
expression the leaf that derives Pangia

922
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,519
have their rxlrs upregulated and the INF

923
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,240
went down regulated at levels that we

924
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,399
associate with early stage phop

925
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,798
infection it looks very much like when

926
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:12,678
we look at gene expression in in phyo

927
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,200
infecting well being a good botr but the

928
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:18,200
plri spania their expression looks an

929
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,200
awful lot like late stage necrotic phyo

930
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,558
or phyo kind of lazily growing in a

931
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,278
plate and I'm not making the argument

932
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,720
that the upregulated elicit and the

933
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:28,398
downregulated rxlr are resulting in some

934
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,639
sort of resistance or something it's

935
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:34,439
just that in order for the plate drive

936
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:37,278
spia to infect and really start causing

937
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,720
this early biotropic disease that phyo

938
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,319
is so good at it has to really

939
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,880
significantly change its gene expression

940
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,759
it's got to down regulate that stuff

941
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,440
it's got to upregulate the infectors

942
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,599
whereas the lethal jar spry are already

943
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,399
expressing just like we would expect

944
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,319
them early stage disease um so I I

945
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:52,798
started building the hypothesis that

946
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,519
that the the gene expression in these

947
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,519
tissue dry sprang and sprang we wash

948
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:59,599
from Leets is already at what it needs

949
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,200
to be a good early pathogen it's already

950
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,158
set and ready to go so as soon as it is

951
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,679
applied it can start growing and by 144

952
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,079
hours we have this overwhelming disease

953
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,240
right you're 100% with the lab

954
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,919
experiments whereas the the culture

955
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,598
Drive Pangia uh they're just not there

956
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,199
yet they just need to take some time to

957
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,280
change the regulation before they can

958
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,759
really effectively infect and that may

959
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,040
result in that that shift in the disease

960
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,240
that I had with those arrows you know

961
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,398
that skews the window that we're looking

962
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,199
at it may just set them back a week or

963
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,358
so which is actually sort of like what

964
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:36,078
we saw in those in the the lab the plate

965
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:38,559
experiments um in so in summary for the

966
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,919
for the phenotypic analysis that the

967
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:44,199
leafl derived inoculum um caused a

968
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,638
significant amount more disease than the

969
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,480
pl dve inoculum with the same lineage

970
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,159
and this held true across all the trials

971
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,039
in field type experiments and in lab

972
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,320
type experiments um and it held true you

973
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,838
for both isol

974
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,920
um it's notable and and it was pretty

975
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:03,119
apparent that there was a difference

976
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,720
between the two isolates um and and it

977
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,519
again was was the same through all the

978
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,279
different trials that I did and it may

979
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,039
have something to do with the the time

980
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,440
in culture one for woman who had been

981
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:14,079
growing in culture for a year before I

982
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,760
used it whereas the New York Val was

983
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,119
right off of being a pathogen on the

984
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,920
wild um but I can't make too many

985
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,200
conclusions about what time and culture

986
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,760
might induce I would need an awful lot

987
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,719
more isolates to look at uh to really

988
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
make some firm statements on that and

989
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,919
and that might be an exciting thing to

990
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,480
do in the future but I I couldn't make

991
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,079
those assessments with just the F that I

992
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:38,119
had here um the realtime PCR uh

993
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,400
basically told me that with with the

994
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,200
methods that I have right now at least

995
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,280
with the real time PCR I can't see much

996
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,279
difference in my my tissue samples I'm

997
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,040
going to have to wait for the r

998
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,400
sequencing to see if I can see anything

999
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,279
different but even then it may be the

1000
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,119
fact that um in my my tissue samples in

1001
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,079
my time P samples I'm just seeing the

1002
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,838
difference in disease stage between the

1003
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,200
two but what it really focused is that

1004
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,599
um

1005
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,358
the um sporangial RNA sequencing and the

1006
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,200
spial real time is what's really going

1007
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:09,838
to be the Crux between these two and so

1008
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,879
for for the RNA seek um as I said a

1009
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,318
minute ago I'm I'm I'm still very keen

1010
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,318
to look at my tissue samples over the

1011
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,519
time course um and I'm really interested

1012
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,119
in what's going on but they may just

1013
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:21,159
reflect the disease progression whereas

1014
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,358
the spangel gene expression is really

1015
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,358
going to be uh how I'm going to be

1016
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,799
focusing on the time going forward they

1017
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,199
look like they're really quite different

1018
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,280
and I'm really excited

1019
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,279
see how they do and so that's um that's

1020
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,880
it I wanted to to thank everybody in my

1021
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,599
lab all the current members certainly in

1022
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,559
the past members who have left giovana

1023
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,200
and and Richard um all the other

1024
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:45,078
graduate students especially the members

1025
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,519
of the per lab who I've been bothering

1026
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,960
uh incessantly for help with the r&amp;

1027
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,559
stens saying they've been very very

1028
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,480
helpful um certainly the folks at the

1029
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,318
the farm uh in Freeville the Thompson

1030
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,760
research Farm Steve McKay and the staff

1031
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:58,920
there um you know it's I've done quite a

1032
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,079
few field trials with them and they put

1033
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,200
in an awful lot of work for us um and

1034
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,200
the folks down at the at the greenhouse

1035
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,279
and you know everybody who's who's

1036
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,358
helping with this so thank you very

1037
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,359
[Applause]

1038
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,400
much so if you're using 5,000 spray

1039
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,400
engine per M and

1040
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,280
spray cim something I guess the question

1041
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,440
is do you see you know if you look in

1042
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,040
the microscope do you see different

1043
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,800
behaviors of

1044
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:34,159
spia in initial germination and

1045
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,119
infection uh so I I haven't assessed

1046
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:39,039
them um microscopically I I haven't

1047
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,960
looked at that it's

1048
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,880
it's it would be difficult to see them

1049
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,119
on the Lea I I don't know it would be a

1050
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,440
really interesting thing to to look at

1051
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,160
um and we have done germination

1052
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,358
experiments with other ISS we we've done

1053
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,000
it between clone line just a couple

1054
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,400
times to see how quickly they they

1055
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,960
germinate and that might be a really

1056
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,720
good thing to do actually looking

1057
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,358
forward even if it was just on culture

1058
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,279
that but I I haven't looked at it um and

1059
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,239
so no I'm not sure what they're doing

1060
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,280
you know immediately when they're on on

1061
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:10,919
new tissue like that presumably only a

1062
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,839
fraction yes yeah uh certainly not all

1063
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,559
of them germinate um and the inoculum

1064
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:17,239
that I'm spraying because I let them um

1065
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,838
germinate in the the fridge for a while

1066
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,719
it's actually it's more of a mixed

1067
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,480
suspension of sprang and zport it's

1068
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,838
quite a bit of zport water so the zores

1069
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:31,000
are applied direct to the leaves and

1070
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:32,000
they very quickly Le um and uh so I

1071
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,519
would be looking at that which actually

1072
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,599
quite a bit smaller but yeah I would

1073
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,199
expect that only a fraction of them

1074
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,599
survive but I'm not really sure you know

1075
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,879
what the what the spores for the ones

1076
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,400
that I don't see disease for a quite

1077
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,960
extend of time are doing in that time

1078
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,960
I'm not I'm

1079
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:58,240
not do you think that at um the

1080
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:01,079
difficulty in taking theia from pure

1081
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,679
culture going into plants is related to

1082
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,318
the same

1083
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:07,399
phenomenon um yeah so it certainly could

1084
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:09,800
be uh there there are a couple things

1085
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,358
contributing to that um the simplest

1086
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
some of them are actually just a

1087
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,639
mechanical problem one of the problems

1088
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,599
is if you if you if you were to transfer

1089
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,159
like an Aug cube of a of a culture of

1090
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:21,000
phoon to a leaflet it has a tendency to

1091
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:23,399
just really grow out of that it fluffs

1092
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,800
up you got a cotton byp Aug Cube it

1093
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,079
preferentially is growing on the media

1094
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,200
it doesn't want to go into belief it's

1095
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,400
you know it's difficult to gr into

1096
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,000
um so when we when we you know if we

1097
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,160
make parangal suspensions and annihilate

1098
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that way it's a lot more effective um

1099
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,440
but it is tricky and it it certainly may

1100
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,838
have to do quite a bit you know with

1101
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,200
this delay infection if you're if you're

1102
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,400
going to detached leaflet in a in a

1103
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,118
moist chamber um and it's sitting you

1104
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,800
know at 18 degrees down in our in our

1105
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,800
cold room in that moist chamber just the

1106
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,680
leaf um and there's no Disease by you

1107
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,160
know by by six days right or by you a

1108
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:56,399
little over a week then you start

1109
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,000
running into problems with uh the cells

1110
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,318
start apoptosing from the from the water

1111
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,199
you know they sit in this water a and

1112
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:03,559
cells start to explode or they can get

1113
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,799
bacterially contaminated or just start

1114
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,599
to degrade from not being on a plant for

1115
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,880
that long and so one of the challenges

1116
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,200
uh with that is just that the tissue

1117
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,480
gets crafty before we can isolate

1118
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:15,960
anything good from it um I suppose if we

1119
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,199
tried to wake up our cultures by

1120
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,559
spraying them onto field plants um maybe

1121
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:22,559
it would be a bit more reliable I mean

1122
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,599
we we I reliably got disease off of my

1123
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,880
with my culture it just took a while but

1124
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,318
we don't really have that uh that

1125
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,160
luxury when we're trying to just wake it

1126
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:33,679
up in the lab for experiments but it

1127
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,000
certainly could contribute and maybe a b

1128
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:38,559
part of it yeah it certainly explain why

1129
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,318
it's such a

1130
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:45,799
pain I you a question yeah Sean one

1131
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:47,279
issue two questions the phenomena you

1132
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,760
describing when we first presented some

1133
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,519
of the quanti PCR data where you were uh

1134
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,440
saw different levels of disease and saw

1135
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,000
perhaps order manag difference and you

1136
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,280
were were suggesting

1137
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
perhaps an artifact just not having much

1138
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,160
disease or pathogen acids but was the

1139
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,440
issue there that you were at the

1140
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,239
threshold of detection and the reason

1141
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,119
I'm wondering is because you see they

1142
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,318
have an internal control that you were

1143
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,440
normalizing into and presumably the same

1144
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:20,800
question is going to come up when you

1145
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:24,800
look at your your your large scale suby

1146
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,519
data right um no the the the threshold

1147
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,760
of detection uh I was talking about I

1148
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,480
think has more to do with if I was to

1149
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,440
look at a bigger variety of genes some

1150
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,679
of those lower Express genes that maybe

1151
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,880
more intricately involved I don't think

1152
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,199
I would be able to see them at that low

1153
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,200
level of disease I think that the

1154
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,919
phenomenon that I saw there you're right

1155
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,118
it was it was normalized out to it so

1156
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,079
that was normalized the amount of

1157
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,559
material that was there um so that's not

1158
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,359
a detection problem that was just truly

1159
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,078
representative of the amount of material

1160
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,358
that I had there so that was normalized

1161
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:55,079
too a

1162
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:56,400
phoy um so it was just more of an

1163
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,400
overall quantifier how much was there if

1164
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
I had normalized it to a tomato Jee for

1165
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,800
instance and we would got some some wild

1166
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,119
things but it was yeah it was internally

1167
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,720
controlled for it so it was

1168
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,920
just just refle it was it was being

1169
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,039
those genes are being expressed at the

1170
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,559
same level the two samples the quantity

1171
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,599
that I saw the difference was just how

1172
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,318
much was

1173
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,800
there that if that makes any

1174
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:24,079
sense and when you get to your large

1175
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,240
scale sequency data presumably you're

1176
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,000
going to run into the same issues uh so

1177
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,239
yeah I I I certainly might I'm going to

1178
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,440
have to going to have to spend a lot of

1179
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,399
time working on trying to to tweeze out

1180
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,559
absolute numbers right that finding

1181
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
normalizers is going to be really

1182
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,559
important

1183
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,519
for R

1184
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,920
sequencing it should also be uh you know

1185
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,599
more sensitive than this real time was

1186
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,119
too and actually in the limited time

1187
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,039
that I had I didn't get to spend as much

1188
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,200
time optimizing real time as I would

1189
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:56,519
have liked to um you know it had it has

1190
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,519
a lot of way to go with in real time

1191
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:02,318
actually able to to to Really really

1192
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,719
rely on it heavily um and it's just been

1193
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:07,239
a matter of

1194
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:07,239
time I'm not sure if

1195
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,000
I John hey Sean um so you said that your

1196
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:16,200
tissue samples you believe are

1197
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,599
reflective of of a delay in disease

1198
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,679
progression so when they when you um

1199
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,800
look at them inspect them again later

1200
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,078
and you find that they've reached the

1201
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:30,240
same level of disease you think that the

1202
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:33,839
plate derived inoculum disease is due to

1203
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:36,439
that primary uh inoculum or is this now

1204
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,880
secondary inoculum that has grown on

1205
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,440
those Le that's a that's a that's a

1206
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,920
really good question um so in field

1207
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,480
plants if I had let the field plants

1208
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,358
grow much much longer uh I suspect that

1209
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,318
there may have been some problems with

1210
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,239
secondary n in the lab

1211
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:54,558
experiments there's no air movement spy

1212
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,279
aren't really going to be it as they

1213
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,599
grew up they just progressed from sort

1214
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,440
of arose I don't think that there's any

1215
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:04,880
secondary accul over the short time that

1216
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,039
I'm looking at with these isolates

1217
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,358
especially you know so the lab exper had

1218
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,519
1% in 144 hours there's barely any

1219
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,159
spoilation that's not going to be enough

1220
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,519
to somehow go out infect and then in a

1221
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,118
week later cause a much heavier module

1222
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:20,239
of disease so I I I don't think that

1223
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,480
secondary infection played much of a

1224
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,838
role in that I think that it it it was

1225
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,639
truly just sort of a a delay it didn't

1226
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:28,759
get going very quickly um and I think

1227
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:30,440
you had a second part of the question

1228
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,160
though don't remember what it was I

1229
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,519
think that was it that was it

1230
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:40,199
okay you think a difference between spia

1231
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,000
growing on leaves compared to spania

1232
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,519
growing on plates so like they they've

1233
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,039
been provided with different amounts of

1234
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,039
nutrients for they growing or they

1235
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:55,279
different I mean it may be I mean I mean

1236
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:58,318
the the augur that we grow on potato

1237
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,440
auger Ry auger and I use a Ry and PE

1238
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,719
mixture I mean that's not right it's not

1239
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,639
tomato leaves um yeah there certainly

1240
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,519
could be a difference in in in nutrients

1241
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,679
there could be

1242
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,358
some have some effect on that I'm not

1243
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:17,318
sure I haven't looked into

1244
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,318
the Avail nutrients

1245
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,399
this anybody

1246
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:29,440
else so before we thank Sean again I'd

1247
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:35,599
like to ask one question um take

1248
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:39,119
toare 100 samples from tissue to

1249
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,240
C I can do uh eight at a time with the

1250
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,760
kit that I was using and that protocol

1251
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,639
from straight RNA to a finish seting

1252
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,079
library takes about five and a half

1253
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:52,279
hours and so 100 samples across five and

1254
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,960
a half hours doing it every day how long

1255
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,519
do it take to get the

1256
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:00,679
RNA about three hours three and a half

1257
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:04,679
hours from uh from from sample it's a

1258
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:04,679
long process oh I was Shor than I

1259
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:11,558
thought there's a lot of checking and

1260
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,480
rechecking between so um thank you Sean

1261
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,480
and see you

1262
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,719
next this has been a production of
