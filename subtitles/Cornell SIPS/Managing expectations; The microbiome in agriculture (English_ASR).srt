1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,120
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,120
University thank you

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,160
Jenny thank you I'll try and live up to

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,439
that wonderful introduction I feel uh a

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
little bit over empowered by that um

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,679
yeah so I am a microbial ecologist I

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,719
actually started out my life as a marine

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,640
microbial ecologist and um applying the

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,879
rules of how bacteria communicate with

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,118
each other and with their environment

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,518
how they sense things uh to

12
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,599
understanding how they do that in many

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,238
other ecosystems what it is a really

14
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,878
amazing time to be a microbial ecologist

15
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:38,479
this is the one of the few times in

16
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,718
history where people have actually taken

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,078
us really deadly seriously the first

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
time was probably in the late 19th

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,439
century when they found out bacteria

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
could kill you and now they found out

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,039
that bacteria can make people healthy

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,519
they're really starting to pay attention

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,000
and what's great is that the

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Horticultural world is starting to pay

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,799
attention as well and the fact that the

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
bacteria that colonize plants and live

27
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,358
on the outsides of plants and insides of

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,280
plants actually may be playing a role in

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
the health of the plant now obviously

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,960
this isn't anything new um in fact if

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,759
anything the agricultural world has led

32
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,719
the world of science in utilizing and

33
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,200
understanding how bacteria play a role

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,879
in the health of plants you know uh you

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,240
can't look at nitrogen fixation any

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,519
other way but it's been incredibly

37
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,839
important for us as researchers to

38
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,199
understand how all of the ecological

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,240
interactions that go on inside the

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,478
ecosystem which is a plant uh how they

41
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,879
play a role in the health and

42
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,799
productivity and development of these or

43
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:37,399
organisms so something to do with plants

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,799
and microbes um I changed my title uh I

45
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,239
I am did found the Earth microbiome

46
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,079
project around 5 years ago this was a an

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,519
effort to catalog microbial diversity in

48
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:49,559
as many environments as we could find um

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,199
with my colleagues Rob Knight and Janet

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,280
Jansen we we really tried to push this

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,680
forward as a as a an opportunity to look

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,280
into ecosystems and build out a

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,439
repository to help us understand how

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,560
many organisms there were uh their

55
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,078
potential functions and how they were

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
interacting with the world around them

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,719
on a global scale so you know uh as was

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,280
famous for Chicago we had no small plans

59
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,080
it was a very big undertaking we were

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,280
very ambitious at the beginning and then

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
we started to ramp back our Ambitions as

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,840
we found out quite how difficult it was

63
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,919
to get people to share their samples and

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
share their data um we initially thought

65
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,679
well everybody will want to have the

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
microbiome sequence of course cuz the

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
microbiome's awesome and then we quickly

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,039
realized that people were not

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,640
necessarily as excited about sharing all

70
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,359
of their carbon data and uh you know all

71
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,719
the ancer data that we thought was just

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,239
anid data which turned out to be

73
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,199
people's PhD thesises and uh and

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,840
Publications uh they weren't quite as

75
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,399
willing to share that upfront as we

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
thought they would be and and so we

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,959
started to scale back our Ambitions but

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
to date um with over the 400

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,479
collaborators we have we processed

80
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,839
around 50,000 samples for um 16s

81
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,799
ribosomal RNA sequencing about half of

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,519
those for about for 18s ribor sequencing

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
and then um a smattering of those for

84
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,039
shotgun metagenomics as we slowly burnt

85
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,759
through our um Financial supplies and

86
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,639
contacts these represent over 50 large

87
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,759
scale biomes a biome being like open

88
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:18,199
ocean or um prairie soil you know um and

89
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,318
there's around 60 6 billion sequences in

90
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,479
this database um with a little over 27

91
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:26,359
million bacterial TXS are identified um

92
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,039
and the data analysis is occurring in

93
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,200
the public forum all of this data is

94
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,199
made publicly available immediately

95
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,878
um we haven't actually published any of

96
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,719
the results of this study other people

97
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,000
have been publishing it for us um and as

98
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,639
I was I was talking to Terry on the way

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,239
from the airport I was saying well you

100
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,438
know we'd be quite happy if someone

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,759
wanted to take all this data and

102
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:48,239
actually publish it because it's a pain

103
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,560
in the ass to try and analyze it so that

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,560
would be that would be fantastic there

105
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,319
is a people coming out have been

106
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,719
utilizing some of this data to try and

107
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,238
understand how many species there might

108
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:59,000
be on earth and to predict that number

109
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,759
of species and there are exciting

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,719
studies coming out that utilizing this

111
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,280
data to understand biogeographic

112
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,840
patterns um pattern associations with

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,438
different climactic variables etc etc

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
but I'm going to talk a little bit about

115
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,840
how we've utilized some of these data

116
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,120
and other studies in order to try and

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,478
derive um some kind of large scale

118
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,918
ecological understanding of the

119
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,039
interactions between plants and bacteria

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,039
and over soil systems so um one of the

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,800
first ones we did as part of the EMP was

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,919
work with Rebecca MCU and um and Fiera

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
on modeling utilizing microbial

124
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,879
Community Systems to model how bacterial

125
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,279
communities varied across um a range of

126
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,719
prairie conditions in the midwest so

127
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,679
collecting samples from tall Relic uh

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,759
sorry Relic Tall Grass Prairie sites

129
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,199
meant creeping into uh basically

130
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,240
graveyards in the dead of night and

131
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,759
taking soil cores and into disused

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,439
railway lines anywhere that hadn't

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,800
really been used um for agricultural

134
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,639
activity since around 1850 um this meant

135
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,319
Civil War graveyards um we we basically

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,960
collected samples from those because

137
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,360
they were the least contaminated by

138
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,719
agricultural activity Illinois has lost

139
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,520
about 98 to 99% of its Prairie I mean

140
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,880
you know that's a remarkable uh

141
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,038
degradation of a natural biological

142
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,759
environment and one that you know we we

143
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,360
bitterly complain with other countries

144
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,560
try and uh you know agricultural eyesee

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,319
their land in you know in the

146
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,959
destruction of the Amazon rainforest but

147
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,680
look what we did to one of our primary

148
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
biological environments nearly

149
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,038
comprehensively destroyed it but we

150
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,439
utiliz this information to look at the

151
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,719
microbial communities um in different

152
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,600
sites around this um this from the

153
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,800
extent of this Prairie system and then

154
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,680
we interpolated and extrapolated Beyond

155
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,720
those points to understand how climactic

156
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,600
variables that exist now correlate with

157
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,240
the position of those microbes um along

158
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,120
with plant variables and then we

159
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,199
hindcast that back to around 1840 to

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,600
when the Prairie was complete so the the

161
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,879
extent of the Midwest um gr tall grass

162
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
land Prairie system had a distribution

163
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,399
that looked something like that by

164
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,679
mapping our um association between

165
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,439
climactic variables and plant

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,038
distribution patterns we were able to

167
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,719
identify the uh predicted relative

168
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,519
abundances of of organisms like the Vero

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,280
microbia fym um across that system and

170
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,478
generate some kind of predictive

171
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,918
understanding of the distribution of

172
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,000
that organism now why is that important

173
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,478
well baruka microbia are hard to culture

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,079
um the entire film has very few cultured

175
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,959
representatives in our databases um they

176
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,680
flourish where carbon nitrogen ratios

177
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,239
are very high um because they they they

178
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,879
don't necessarily do so well when you

179
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,478
have a lot of nitrogen they're good at

180
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,639
Carbon metabolism and they're good at

181
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,038
activating resources which can be used

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
by certain types of plants and so when

183
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,159
soils are turned over to Agriculture and

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,319
you get an increase in nitrogen you see

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,759
these things disappearing very quickly

186
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,400
and we're very interested in trying to

187
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,598
identify ways to restore these Prairie

188
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,519
ecosystems and we you know it's so very

189
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,159
well to go in and you know rip out all

190
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,478
of the existing vegetation and just

191
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,879
plant a load of new seeds and that

192
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,878
that's proven to be very effective in

193
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,919
certain systems but we're also Keen to

194
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,400
say well how can we create stable

195
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,478
ecosystems how can we rebuild carbon

196
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,198
processes and organic matter pools

197
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,560
Within These systems which support the

198
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,879
uh the autonomous preservation of that

199
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,759
environment and to do that we had to

200
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,160
understand those bacteria which were

201
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,160
significantly related to that and more

202
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,360
importantly their functional diversity

203
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,080
and their capability of supporting car

204
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,038
Caron and nitrogen turnover in these

205
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,359
environments right so this may seem a

206
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:39,598
little bit like oh wow they us time

207
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
traveling statistics to predict what

208
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,719
things look like 150 years ago whoopy

209
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,479
dooo but if you yeah it does look like

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,319
that but but that's not necessarily the

211
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:52,598
the be and endle what we're really

212
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,199
trying to do is capture the system and

213
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,399
understand how that system varies

214
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,720
understand what perturbs it what leads

215
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,399
to its stability so that we can try and

216
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,120
recreate it not just in our computers

217
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,279
but in the field and so working with um

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
other researchers around the Midwest and

219
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,679
on the East Coast we're now trying to

220
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,399
implement some of the work that we've

221
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,680
done here in small plots and actually

222
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:19,399
build out new systems where we where we

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,000
have restored Prairie sites um we've

224
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,038
also been working on this in uh in a

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,918
different context um but across

226
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,360
climactic gradient so this is work we're

227
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,399
doing um with my colleagues in National

228
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,240
Chinese Academy of Science is um trying

229
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,278
to understand the differentiation in

230
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,879
forest ecosystems um across a a

231
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,879
climactic gradient along the east coast

232
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,879
of China so um work in collaboration

233
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,519
between our Labs we took samples along

234
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,480
this gradient 110 so samples from both

235
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,399
natural undisturbed forests um across

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,240
this this gradient um and then basically

237
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,200
analyze the diversity of ARA bacteria

238
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,799
and fungi um this paper is uh in

239
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,959
submission I'll show you a lot of data

240
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,159
today

241
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,359
uh that's not yet been published so um

242
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,958
you can you can feel free to peer review

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,919
critique it as much as you want uh but

244
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm I've always been very upfront about

245
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,360
presenting the data that we we are

246
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,639
already working on I think it's

247
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,000
important to get feedback from the

248
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,120
community and also if you can analyze it

249
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,720
faster than we can then go for it that'd

250
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,399
be cool um but um so you know we see a

251
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,839
lot of Kota we see a lot of AF prodia no

252
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,120
big deal we see a lot of ASCO myota um

253
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,560
but we do see amazing biogeographic

254
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,159
variance and we can map and model that

255
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,399
variance to large scale Network patterns

256
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,759
to ID identify strong correlative

257
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,399
interaction space between different

258
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:45,639
kingdoms of organisms so every dot here

259
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,399
is a bacterial otu every Green Dot is a

260
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:51,039
eukariotic OU blue is ARA uh red uh

261
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,839
black lines sorry are positive and the

262
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,480
red interactions you can't see many of

263
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,839
those in fact I can't even see them and

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,680
I'm looking that close there's some

265
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,360
there are are negative co-associations

266
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:04,078
and this again just looks like a morass

267
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,200
of of network information but by teasing

268
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,599
apart the topology of these networks we

269
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,560
can actually start to understand how

270
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,240
some climactic variables can lead to

271
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,359
differentiation in coassociation

272
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,759
patterns so all these connections are

273
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,720
strong and significant only those with a

274
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,278
spearmans of greater than 0.7 are

275
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
actually identified in this network

276
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,519
structure each size of each node is

277
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,399
proportional to the relative abundance

278
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,278
of the organism and there there's 66,000

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,278
associations among 3,000 microbial to

280
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:35,320
use okay um sorry nearly 4,000 90% of

281
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,078
these interactions are Global and only

282
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,519
10 are region specific so there are

283
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,599
inherent structures within forest

284
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,639
ecosystems across the Eastern seab Board

285
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,040
of China which are globally distributed

286
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,519
no matter what we see in the system

287
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,078
suggesting that there's Niche

288
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,600
specificity within a forest ecosystem

289
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,799
irrespective of the climactic region but

290
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,720
the inherent variance in the system this

291
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,639
10% of these interactions which are

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,278
region specific that's what yields

293
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,120
climatic range specificity and that

294
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,439
climatic range specificity is what's

295
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,159
interesting to us because by

296
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,760
understanding the variance between

297
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,000
regions we can start to understand what

298
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,200
makes an ecosystem important in that

299
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
environment because those organisms may

300
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:25,040
be important to the system ecology

301
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,240
um so looking at this if we look at um

302
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,278
how we interpret that Network topology

303
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,360
the connectivity of the network is

304
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,278
greater we get more connections more

305
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,240
significant interactions between

306
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,720
bacteria ARA and and UK carats up in the

307
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,480
um in the northern region compared to

308
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,519
the southern region we get greater

309
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,039
precipitation in the South it's a

310
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,360
semi-tropical environment um and we

311
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,879
believe that this greater precipitation

312
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,800
leads to decreased Niche differentiation

313
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,000
essentially you're getting more moisture

314
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,679
connectivity in the environment moisture

315
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,639
connectivity allows microbes to uh move

316
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,000
out of their individual pockets and

317
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,839
interact more on a global scale

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,159
indirectly through um metabolite

319
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,920
transfer and directly through movement

320
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,319
um and so you get an Inc a decrease in

321
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,679
the in the um specific Niche

322
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,440
connectivity between organisms and an

323
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,479
increase in broadscale characterization

324
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,240
of network space so lower precipitation

325
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,920
North induces a strong Niche

326
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,399
differentiation basically organisms

327
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,319
clustering down in their little niches

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,120
um diff disassociated from other

329
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,560
organisms which may be a millimeter away

330
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,839
on another organic Mass matter particle

331
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,278
and that that Niche differentiation is a

332
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
globally attributable trait um in a

333
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,838
study I'm not going to talk about in

334
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
detail actually not going to mention

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,000
apart from right now when I am going to

336
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,480
mention it um but the hospital

337
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,278
microbiome project we in this study we

338
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,600
we followed a hospital environment um 10

339
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,799
patient rooms two nursing stations for

340
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,720
365 consecutive days cataloging all of

341
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,479
the patients on three body surfaces and

342
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,600
all the staff and all of the

343
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,879
environments within the hospital um some

344
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,560
50 different surfaces including air and

345
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,120
water and we looked at the bacterial

346
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,119
community structure across all of these

347
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,120
environments and we see that people

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,759
share more bacteria between each other

349
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,120
um including patients to staff and staff

350
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,559
to patients and staff to staff when the

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,000
environment has more humidity basically

352
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,239
when bacteria have the capability of

353
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,799
surviving outside the body we see a

354
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,360
definitive increase in Sharing what's

355
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,879
interesting and I again I'm telling you

356
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,560
on published data which is currently in

357
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,879
review but um just don't tell any

358
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,879
um we don't see an increase in disease

359
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,439
burden in that population so this

360
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,000
increase in microbial sharing isn't

361
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,320
leading to an increase in horizontal

362
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,480
sorry so Hospital acquired infections

363
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,360
it's just Distributing microbes on a

364
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,360
bigger scale in fact if anything we see

365
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,159
a small depression and we can talk about

366
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,879
what that means until the cows come home

367
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,120
but moisture is very important it allows

368
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,720
for connectivity it allows for increased

369
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
activity and movement of organisms

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,399
between sites I I am very tangental as

371
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,920
well if I go off on a too weird a track

372
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,440
does someone throw something at me and

373
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:08,078
I'll I'll try get back on to what I was

374
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,680
talking about before anyway so utilizing

375
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,120
this information we can start to build

376
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,799
out um uh InterContinental and

377
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,159
transcontinental understanding of of

378
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,078
microbial community structure and what

379
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,759
it means in a system so this is the

380
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,838
Tibetan Plateau North America collecting

381
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,800
samples in transects um um and dotted

382
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,199
samples around areas and transects

383
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,120
around the Tibetan Plateau across

384
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,639
climactic regions we can start to

385
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,799
interpolate and build maps of microbial

386
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,919
community structure across these systems

387
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,039
and Link them into climactic variables

388
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,039
in an attempt to try and predict how

389
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,879
these systems respond to climate

390
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,919
changing environmental systems so um

391
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,360
don't if this work but yeah are so this

392
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,439
is the Tibetan Plateau starting in 1900

393
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,079
we're now in 1925 1930 with annual

394
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,639
averages and the shift in microbial

395
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,599
community structure uh or Bea diversity

396
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,879
across the whole system as we move

397
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,040
across um a de sorry a cent of climactic

398
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:06,240
variance um what we see in this pretty

399
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:09,120
picture is a is a significant change in

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
the let me just play it again so you can

401
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,360
see it while I'm talking about it is a

402
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,320
significant change in the community uh

403
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,159
fluctuation in the in the

404
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,560
differentiation of microbial community

405
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,559
structure as parts of the system become

406
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,278
uh destabilized due to increasing

407
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,758
temperatures as parts of the system

408
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,838
become highly productive due to

409
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,199
increasing carbon dioxide and as

410
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,480
agricultural activity takes over in the

411
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,838
uh in the latter part of the 20th

412
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,720
century um yes how do you know what it

413
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,199
was in 1910 cuz I went back there I'm

414
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,680
I'm English I'm a time traveler um have

415
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:43,559
you not watched Doctor Who uh so it's

416
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,479
it's it's it's hindcasting we actually

417
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,958
have pretty good climactic records back

418
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,120
to 1910 prior to 1910 they don't exist

419
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,638
there were weather stations present in

420
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,399
parts of Tibet back then um and they

421
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,839
were you know first part by the British

422
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,679
and then and then later by um some of

423
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,360
the French and then the Chinese but the

424
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,758
the the systems been reasonably well

425
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,039
monitored and we have good records for

426
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,720
Global Climate variables at degrees of

427
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,559
resolution for pretty much the whole

428
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,759
globe back to a certain level mostly

429
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,958
interpolated from existing data so I

430
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,240
mean it's a model so oh yeah

431
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,119
everything's a model so it agrees with

432
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,839
your model yeah yeah yeah damn right can

433
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,360
you can you prove me wrong um no no I'm

434
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,319
I'm I'm I'm not trying to predict what

435
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,360
happened beforehand I'm trying to

436
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:26,759
understand if anything what the

437
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,839
relationship is between microbial

438
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,159
Community desability or stability

439
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,360
between years and climactic variables

440
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,039
and because I can even within a 5-year

441
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,680
Grant I can only get 5 years of that

442
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,480
data I have to try and predict outside

443
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,519
the bounds um but you can use this to

444
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,959
make predictions about what's happening

445
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,278
now with you know at a fine scale if you

446
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,479
understand what the long-term trends

447
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,759
might be so again this is just a pretty

448
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,920
picture but underlying it is sort of

449
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,800
fundamental statistical model which can

450
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,719
help us to extrapolate and predict

451
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,958
beyond our measures so in here what's

452
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,639
interesting is the microbial community

453
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,879
structure of present day Tibet is best

454
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,078
predicted why I'm talking to you alone

455
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,000
stand here um best predicted by the the

456
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:14,678
climactic variables in between 1968 and

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,038
1972 so if we look at the which again

458
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,919
it's a bit weird right but if we look at

459
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:21,359
the climate in 1968 1972 that is the

460
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,880
climate which best correlates with what

461
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:27,000
we observe in current day Tibet and the

462
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,919
same is actually equally true for um for

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,798
North America and if we take that as a a

464
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,720
variable um predictive algorithm it

465
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:39,359
means that we can predict if nothing

466
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,400
changed on Earth uh for the next 30

467
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,519
years taking today's climate we can

468
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,720
predict what we should see the system

469
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,879
stabilized to in about 30 years time so

470
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,319
on that basis um this is obviously

471
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,600
Tibetan North America this is the

472
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,359
current richness and um in over the next

473
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,119
30 years if we believe that climate has

474
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,639
this relationship between uh time and

475
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,519
microbial community structure we'll see

476
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,720
a significant shift in richness

477
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,960
basically the systems will become in

478
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,600
increase in richness due to

479
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,400
destabilization of community structure

480
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,399
and reduction in abundance of certain

481
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,640
key organisms but whereas um most of

482
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,120
Tibet will show originally homogeneous

483
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,360
predictive capability the um the uh the

484
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,000
North American Coast will show a highly

485
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,000
heterogeneous response variable but

486
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,558
still majority will increase in in

487
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
richness and um if you see the similar

488
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,519
ity between what happens in Northern

489
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,280
Canada and what happens in this other

490
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:38,359
basically semi Arctic Zone they call

491
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,279
napole the third pole on Earth we see a

492
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,119
similar increase in richness due to a

493
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,440
destabilization of of the um of the adic

494
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,558
variables in the soil system obviously

495
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,600
this is highly linked to plants but what

496
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,558
we haven't done at all is used plants in

497
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,558
any of these calculations we would love

498
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:56,839
to but we don't have a lot of the data

499
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:59,158
what we do see is um uh variance in the

500
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:01,000
types of bacteria that we find

501
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,600
um across these different systems and we

502
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,240
can correlate that to plant inputs so in

503
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,959
Tibet we'll see an increase in Alpha

504
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,599
prot bacteria let me qualify that

505
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,880
statement we predict if everything stays

506
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,678
normal and there's no inputs at all that

507
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,960
we'll see a increase in Alpha bacteria

508
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,519
in a decrease in North America okay of

509
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,558
PR bacteria in both of these systems in

510
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,158
these soil systems show a significant

511
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,558
correlation to carbon nitrogen ratio and

512
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,200
therefore we believe that this could be

513
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:32,119
linked into um um and moisture and could

514
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,440
be linked into a distribution in the

515
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,798
change in below carbon inputs into this

516
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,038
system right so by changing below carbon

517
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:43,158
inputs based on changing um um uh uh

518
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,720
plant uh biodiversity and plant

519
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,480
structure we'll see a shift in the

520
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,960
microbial community structure again we

521
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,759
we do but at least we've got some kind

522
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,798
of understanding of the potential

523
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,319
implications and we're now trying to use

524
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,158
this to predict occurrences each year in

525
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,798
in these systems but it's very broad

526
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,760
scale we're hoping to get much finer

527
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,038
resolution as we move forward with our

528
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:07,480
ability to classify the system okay um

529
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:09,519
to something totally different Mero um I

530
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,440
know I know I was talking I was talking

531
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,720
with the guys working on uh reasing

532
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,480
earlier um you know we we start out in

533
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,759
Mero I I I also love wine um think it's

534
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,839
awesome um and we were very interested

535
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,879
in the connectivity between above ground

536
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,798
tissues in imp plants and what was

537
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,360
happening in the soil and trying to

538
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,960
understand the potential implications

539
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,719
for um strain type variant and microbial

540
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,679
community structure and adic variables

541
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,159
in soil systems so um number one this is

542
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,240
just a a map if the dots are closer

543
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,039
together more similar the black dots

544
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,120
represent otus

545
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,839
ha sorry the black dots represent

546
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,239
bacterial taxa um and the the colored

547
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,959
big dots represent a sample and so what

548
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,679
we've done is basically taken all of the

549
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,558
dots the all the otus and the similarity

550
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,600
and the abundances of those otus starts

551
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:02,519
to drag together or pull apart um

552
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,879
individual sample types so bulk Z soil

553
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,599
and root Zone call a root Zone it wasn't

554
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,480
risos spere it was just the soil around

555
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,879
the roots um uh all cluster very closely

556
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,120
together because they're very similar

557
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,000
environments and then your root system

558
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,879
so the rise of plane starts to

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,558
differentiate significantly from that

560
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,760
and as you move up into grapes and

561
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,000
leaves and and yellow flowers we see a

562
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,599
significant differentiation but you

563
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,640
notice that the otus that are shared in

564
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,278
the soil are also shared down here there

565
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,038
are lots and lots of these lines

566
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:34,519
connecting these green and yellow plots

567
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,839
down to the the yellow and sorry the

568
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:39,400
blue and red plots over here and so that

569
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,759
that immediately told us that that the

570
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,120
vast majority of otus of bacterial TXS

571
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,079
that we found up in the above ground

572
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,319
tissues came from down here or were also

573
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,879
found down here uh if they didn't come

574
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,359
down there they came from there by some

575
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,440
other route um below ground you know you

576
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,079
see um a significant differentiation in

577
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,240
the high level functional struct

578
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,639
community structure of the these

579
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,200
communities um the proteo bacteria

580
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,720
dominating those above ground systems

581
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,679
and mostly organisms which are good at

582
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,519
dealing with stressful environments um

583
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,440
if we if we look at the types of um adic

584
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,960
variables which Drive differentiation in

585
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,480
these systems we see um that the adic

586
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,798
are very important particularly carbon

587
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,200
nitrogen ratio um and pH pH was an very

588
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,480
interesting one for us we saw we looked

589
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,240
at different Vineyards throughout a

590
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,038
Vineyard Vineyard region what's a

591
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,440
Vineyard region called like a winery

592
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,000
region whatever I don't know what to

593
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,840
call it but a place where there were

594
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,278
lots of Vineyards and we looked at the

595
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:38,079
same strain of Mero the same ecotype of

596
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:40,278
Mero across these different Vineyards

597
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,879
and then cataloged how the uh community

598
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:43,839
structure changed across those Vineyards

599
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,080
and we see pH is a big variable that's

600
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,798
drives that because different Vineyards

601
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,839
use different types of organic

602
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,879
fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer to

603
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,879
fertilize the soil and while we sort

604
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,480
impacts of carbon and um and and carbon

605
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,400
nitrogen ratios as drivers the pH

606
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,079
induced in the different soils was still

607
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,679
a key driver which is

608
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,519
known um and interestingly there was a

609
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,320
significant um effect due to air

610
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,319
temperatures indicating a driver for the

611
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,519
microbial teral especially on the above

612
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:16,278
ground surfaces between 2011 and 2012 we

613
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,440
saw a significant differentiation in the

614
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:21,919
flowers um and in the um in the leaves

615
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,720
between the two um annual time points

616
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,120
suggesting that a change in temperature

617
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,360
could have an impact upon what's

618
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,038
happening to the microbial population um

619
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,278
and including in the soil so these these

620
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:35,558
the the system variance was being driven

621
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:40,000
by soil adic and also climactic

622
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:41,558
variables um changing tack again I'm I'm

623
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,679
switching around because I I have lots

624
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:46,440
of stories to tell um we this is all

625
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,440
very well and good understanding how

626
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,798
community structure differentiates

627
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,080
across these natural gradients but what

628
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,319
I'm most interested in is why why

629
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,678
certain bacterial organisms are finding

630
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,558
themselves coassociated with this

631
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,240
environment and becoming abundant versus

632
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:00,839
this en environment what is the

633
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,960
selective pressure driving those

634
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,678
organisms to uh to develop in that space

635
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,519
how do they evolve to adapt to that

636
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,000
environment and the only way to do that

637
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,359
is to start to rebuild the genomes of

638
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,240
those organisms uh from my perspective

639
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,000
and look at the evolutionary drivers and

640
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,278
the trait selection within those

641
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,038
populations um so um we reconstruct

642
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,240
genomes on a large scale from a typical

643
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,720
metagenome we can grab lots of different

644
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,480
bacterial isolates from different Genera

645
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,839
in that system we can grab viral genomes

646
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,880
we can even grab some archal genomes and

647
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,319
we can utilize that information to build

648
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,159
out metabolic models which describe how

649
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,759
those organisms interact with each other

650
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:42,520
and with their environment um so this is

651
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:45,558
a great example working in a soil system

652
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:48,359
um with hydrochloro hexane pollution so

653
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:50,200
this is a um when you create lindane um

654
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,798
you uh you have a pollutant which you

655
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,880
throw back into the soil and there's

656
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:55,639
these huge hch dumps in certain

657
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,399
countries around the world uh they're

658
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,640
illegal in a lot of countries but they

659
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:03,119
create a very toxic environment um and

660
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,240
so by looking at hch degradation in the

661
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,239
microbial Community we can um we look at

662
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,558
organisms we can culture up and genome

663
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,399
sequence and we can map those to

664
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,200
metagenomes we collect from these

665
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:16,439
environments and utilizing that

666
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,038
information we can predict what the last

667
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,360
common ancestor of the extant population

668
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,319
in the system would have been and

669
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,918
utilizing this information it suggests

670
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:28,599
that um the ancestor genotype well lacks

671
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,640
um suest that % of the genes in each

672
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,240
subspecies were absent in the ancestor

673
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,278
so these these subspecies we see present

674
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,519
in the system have gained genetic

675
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,519
material due to a selected pressure

676
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,918
driver from from the pollution event um

677
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,038
the ancestor we we predict is unable to

678
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:49,520
grade hch and it acquires the Lin genes

679
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:51,200
to allow it to degrade hch from this

680
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,319
transpose on mediated lateral Gene

681
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,720
transfer and we can actually even

682
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:58,319
isolate a lot of the transposons and

683
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,038
transposon elements in the in the genes

684
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,960
in the genomes of these organisms and

685
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:05,759
co-associate them and their um nonymous

686
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,640
synonymous ratio with the lindane re

687
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,919
Lind degrading regions um and this helps

688
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,480
us to um predict the functional

689
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,520
capability of that organism and how it

690
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,200
evolved that capability so you know I

691
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,918
know I I understand what you're thinking

692
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,278
I've gone from the entire planet and

693
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,038
I've now zoomed down into one genome but

694
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,398
looking across those scales is really

695
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,000
important and we can also go even

696
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,719
further when we dig down into the abolic

697
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,398
capability of an organism this is

698
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,679
working work we did in Pete MOS um and

699
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:38,038
looking at thota and thermoplasma um

700
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,120
therm oxidizes these longchain fatty

701
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,278
acids V trophic interaction with

702
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,319
methanogens um and what we've been able

703
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:45,960
to do by taking the genomes of these

704
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,398
organisms and looking at them across

705
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,200
Redux gradients in the system we can

706
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:54,119
identify the the the drivers which allow

707
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,919
these organisms to respire so the we got

708
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,879
anerobic respiration with fumerate as a

709
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,759
terminal electron Etc when we when we

710
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,960
look at

711
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,200
thermoplasmata um another organism for

712
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,480
which we had no uh genome relatives in

713
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,960
the system before we see sulfite and

714
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,360
Organo sulphonate uh reduction as the

715
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,159
driver for its capability to respire so

716
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,359
turb electron acceptors are depleted to

717
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,360
very low levels in some of these systems

718
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,759
and yet anerobic respiration is really

719
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,199
dominant still um you know as a key

720
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,919
component and so why are these these Arc

721
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,840
particularly abundant so looking you

722
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,240
know we now fumerate and Organo

723
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,839
sulfonate are important for respiration

724
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,599
of the carbon mineralized in these Pete

725
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,839
lands which gives us an ability at the

726
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:39,480
molecular level to start to understand

727
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,519
the potential implications of changes in

728
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,038
this environment upon carbon

729
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,120
mineralization right and the

730
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,720
remineralization of components into the

731
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,959
biosphere and driving potential changes

732
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,319
in um in climate systems so taking you

733
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
know I've gone from making spirous

734
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:58,240
comments about what happened in the 19

735
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,038
1840s to driving all the way down into

736
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,200
the potential metabolic interactions of

737
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:04,679
an organism with its environment and

738
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,558
linking those substrates between the two

739
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,120
is going to become increasingly

740
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:12,440
important in our ability to derive um uh

741
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,359
appropriate accurate predictive uh

742
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,840
climate models from what we can

743
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:20,079
understand of um as a system driver in

744
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:22,918
in the soil environment um I'm was going

745
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:26,439
to go to a new study sorry I really like

746
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,320
this one this is a brand new one um I I

747
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,480
have no attention span you can

748
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,278
understand that from this um so we

749
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,640
really interested in invading plants

750
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:35,880
mostly because when we're working in

751
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,720
Long Tall Grass prairies we see this

752
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,159
beautiful relationship between a stable

753
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,440
ecosystem and it's it's very stable but

754
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,799
highly um sorry sorry very permanent but

755
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,960
highly instable community structure when

756
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:52,918
we perturb that longrass Prairie even in

757
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,200
Iota the system starts to disassemble

758
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,240
okay um increase the nitrogen by a small

759
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
margin the system disassembles so we

760
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,120
want wanted to understand well how do

761
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,038
when a plant starts to invade the system

762
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,719
how does it influence that belowground

763
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,240
microbial community and what are the

764
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,798
significant drivers and um what can we

765
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,359
say about the uh the uh the legacy of an

766
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,119
invasion um in in terms of perturbing

767
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,959
our ability to restore that environment

768
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,518
back to what it was before so working we

769
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,079
got this multi-billionaire in in Chicago

770
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,679
who bought up a load of land in Montana

771
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,839
um because um he wanted to be a

772
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
biologist when he was a kid but his

773
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,639
daddy said no and he went into the City

774
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,519
and he made a lot of money and now he

775
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,320
gets to play in his sandbox don't you

776
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,440
love those people only in America can I

777
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:42,398
find that kind of human I love it so we

778
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,640
get to play in his sandbox and so he's

779
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,319
he's basically trying to his Gambit is

780
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,600
restore the ecosystem back to the

781
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,200
original torra Prairie so he bought up

782
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,480
10,000 acres of ranch and set us with

783
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,960
this task so if the initial task is to

784
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,519
try and understand why that system needs

785
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,120
to be restored so here we have three

786
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,919
gradients of cheat grass naw and leafy

787
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:07,879
spurge um an invasion gradient from high

788
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,120
abundance of the Invader to absence and

789
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,039
so all intensive purposes is his native

790
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:17,000
Prairie um going up to um an invaded

791
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,440
plot obviously um for for the plants you

792
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,679
do see a very strong gradient between

793
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,399
the plant biodiversity and and the um

794
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,399
and The Invasion plot when when you get

795
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,639
a highly invaded plot um you have sorry

796
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:31,479
invaded plot you have a highly

797
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,000
differentiated plant biodiversity Bea

798
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,679
diversity pattern uh bacteria show a

799
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,919
similar but not quite as robust Trend

800
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,278
apart from apart from in the um the

801
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,360
leafy spurge or escula I can't remember

802
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,119
that might be leafy spurge or cheat

803
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,158
grass but either way it shows a very

804
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,359
strong gradient the fungi show a much

805
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,720
stronger gradient in response uh their

806
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:51,439
be diversity pattern shows a much

807
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,440
stronger gradient in response to the

808
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,519
invasion pattern and so we can start to

809
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,480
say that yes Invasion does have an

810
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,720
impact upon the microbial community INF

811
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,038
structure in that system um we can

812
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,519
differentiate that from well maybe this

813
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,480
Invasion area was pre supposed to be

814
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,240
good for those plants because of these

815
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,440
microbial Community structures or or

816
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,319
some kind of adic variable by looking at

817
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,960
this over time so we uh common Garden

818
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,678
experiments we planted up these systems

819
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,360
with invasives one year after planting

820
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,480
um there's no real significant

821
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,240
difference between the microbial

822
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,720
community structure in either um the

823
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,839
native environment in green cheek grass

824
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,839
in red naweed in blue or spurge in

825
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,678
yellow so one year was not enough um in

826
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:37,678
these systems to derive any kind of

827
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,840
spatial differentiation pattern but

828
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,679
after three years the system starts to

829
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,038
arrange and we're now pushing this on

830
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,240
but we've only just got three years

831
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:48,278
about um eight weeks ago so um what

832
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,679
we're starting to see now is at least at

833
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:53,159
least for nap weed and for spurge we're

834
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:55,559
starting to see significant clustering

835
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,679
of those populations uh the microbial

836
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:00,158
communities in the blowr systems around

837
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,120
that Invasion system so the system

838
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,679
starts to show consistent shifts in

839
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:05,839
chemistry and microbic structure I'm not

840
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,600
showing the chemistry here um and we

841
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,000
believe that these modifications to the

842
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,599
soil properties probably driven by

843
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,720
increases in carbon inputs into the soil

844
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,678
due to predatory release of the of the

845
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,558
Invader in its because it's not not its

846
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,080
native habitat anymore reinforc the

847
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:24,319
dominance of the Invader um making sure

848
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,839
those invasions are difficult to remove

849
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,359
we think unfortunately for our

850
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:31,038
billionaire playboy that it's very very

851
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,759
hard to remove some of these Invaders n

852
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:36,839
impossible um once they get to a certain

853
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,599
level I their legacy on that soil system

854
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,480
might be um might be unattainable unless

855
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,319
you go through an incredibly dramatic

856
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,240
ecosystem structural difference soorry

857
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,918
anyway uh finally um fertilization

858
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,359
reduces Bal I just wanted to point this

859
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,919
out we we do a lot of work uh with

860
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,359
groups um in Africa trying to understand

861
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,159
I've never been to Africa to myself I

862
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:01,638
was saying to uh to Rebecca early but

863
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,440
I'd love to go um but we we are trying

864
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:05,479
to take some of this data and put it

865
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,159
into a more translational framework so

866
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,159
that people grows especially can start

867
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,159
to utilize it and so trying to

868
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:13,000
understand how differential land use

869
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,480
strategies such as rotations and

870
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,398
fertilizer combinations can be used to

871
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,839
increase functional capacity so

872
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,599
utilizing um uh numerical models and

873
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,558
statistical models we can start to

874
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,638
understand the potential implications of

875
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,918
differential um uh Land Management

876
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:30,359
strategies for improving productivity

877
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,720
for some of the 9900 million poor people

878
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:36,278
who are using um agriculture as their

879
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,839
subsistence mechanism any right on a

880
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:40,759
completely different note how much

881
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:43,359
longer have I got I know I got to be

882
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:47,278
strict about seven minutes seven more

883
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:49,798
minutes okay um you are currently

884
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,200
sitting in a built ecosystem right every

885
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,200
single one of you is emitting 38 million

886
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,880
bacterial cells into your environment

887
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,639
every hour you're all becoming more

888
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,080
microbiologically similar the people who

889
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:00,638
are sitting closer to each other are

890
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,359
becoming more microbiologically similar

891
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,158
than the people sitting further away if

892
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:06,359
you are physically interacting you'd be

893
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,880
increasing that degree of similarity and

894
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,440
this environment is the environment

895
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,919
where we're all growing up okay where we

896
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,480
as a species unless you grew up on a

897
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,838
farm or you grew up in the Amazon

898
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,960
rainforest I don't know there might be

899
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:18,039
some people in the room that fit that

900
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,838
description the vast majority of us grew

901
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:23,358
up in a 20th century home or some of

902
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:25,878
your 21st century home and that has

903
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,119
significantly altered your microbial

904
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,838
interaction compared to what your

905
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,440
ancestors experienced um your ancestors

906
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,398
probably experienced a more agrarian

907
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,398
lifestyle interacting with the cows and

908
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,319
the pigs not playing on their iPads but

909
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:39,319
actually living outside and working

910
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,079
outside even as young children and that

911
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,720
increased the microbial biodiversity of

912
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,960
their bodies when when your child is

913
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,719
brought back from the from the hospital

914
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,519
and lives in this environment where it's

915
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,199
consistently cleaned and made quite

916
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,199
sterile this architecturally artificial

917
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,519
system is altering their microbial

918
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,319
profile but enough about health um we

919
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,759
started off this whole Gambit on health

920
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,519
but I wanted to talk a little bit about

921
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,839
microbial forensics it's a new track of

922
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,320
mine something I'm very interested in um

923
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,679
we started out by doing a study for the

924
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,280
Sloan foundation on the home microbiome

925
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,199
we found um among other things that

926
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,960
families um we could look at the

927
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,960
bacterial community on say the floors

928
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,920
and the door knobs Etc and we could with

929
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,679
a high degree of accuracy predict which

930
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,119
family belonged to which home based on

931
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,159
the bacteria they left behind in their

932
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,440
home because of those 38 million

933
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,480
microbial cells you're shedding your

934
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,240
microbial cloud a microbial fingerprint

935
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,480
in your home right nice this is um this

936
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,559
is uh each one of these shows a

937
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,480
particular surface focus on the kitchen

938
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,400
counter these are three people a

939
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,358
grown-up child living with their his

940
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,880
parents um and the three dogs um if we

941
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,039
look at the kitchen counter person three

942
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,240
their microbiome is the predominant

943
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:50,639
influencer of that environment the

944
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,399
predominant source for bacteria found in

945
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,318
that environment um she's the mother of

946
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,160
the family there's no gender bias here

947
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,838
but you can see that um she actually

948
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,318
went away for a little while person one

949
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,799
goes away here and his microbiome

950
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,400
disappears U that's the red one but

951
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,318
person uh person two who is the father

952
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,960
of the home his microbiome suddenly

953
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:10,719
became dominant in the kitchen when his

954
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,358
wife went away for a couple of days so

955
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,199
there a lot didn't it um the kitchen

956
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:16,679
floor was dominated by dog bacteria um

957
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,000
we think this is obviously important

958
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,759
because dogs are significantly

959
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,039
contributing as well as the mother's

960
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,040
bacteria having a significant role

961
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,800
because her cloud is depositing bacteria

962
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,358
there um we can also tell when people

963
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,920
are physically interacting it's a young

964
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,759
couple living with a lodger focus on

965
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,880
this PCA diagram over here um we can

966
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,040
tell that the red and blue um samples

967
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,760
are closer together that's a couple who

968
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,039
are not genetically related but who are

969
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,119
living together and sharing more

970
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,559
microbes because of their physical

971
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,358
interaction hopefully not with the

972
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:45,159
lodger the lodger does indeed show a

973
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,838
significantly differentiated microbiome

974
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,039
compared to the young couple more

975
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,799
similar to the young couple than he is

976
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,318
to anyone else in our study because he's

977
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,839
living in the same space and sharing the

978
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:55,719
microbial Cloud their noses are not

979
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,318
microbiologically similar because people

980
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:00,439
don't interact with their

981
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:02,279
noses um so working with Time Magazine

982
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,240
we applied this technique with the

983
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,839
Department of Justice to set up some

984
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,959
crime scene investigations that was the

985
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:12,119
unfortunate cover of our uh our issue of

986
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,119
time but Jared Hampton Marcel who's my

987
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,599
my awesome lab manager and and all

988
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,039
around Guru he um if you ever want to

989
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,640
know anything about DNA extraction he's

990
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:22,440
your man but um he went down to uh

991
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,159
Florida because it's warm in the winter

992
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,240
and worked with the Florida PD on uh and

993
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,679
the their forensic team on setting up a

994
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:32,439
crime scene crime scene uh we had a

995
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,318
professor's house from local University

996
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,639
uh his wife and their cat living in a

997
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,199
house they went away for like 10 minutes

998
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,199
and two of the students well like an

999
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:41,719
hour and a half sorry two of the

1000
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,559
students broke into the house and um and

1001
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:45,919
ransacked their fridge uh stole their TV

1002
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,880
um they were in there for like 35

1003
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
minutes and then they left okay we went

1004
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,760
in with the PD because this burglar had

1005
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,240
happened um and um we uh swapped all the

1006
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,480
surfaces of the floor sequenced the

1007
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,639
microbiome on the floor and on the

1008
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,318
surfaces we went then brought the

1009
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,799
husband and wife and the cat back in and

1010
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,519
sequenced their microbiome from their

1011
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,359
skin surfaces subtracted the resident

1012
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,358
microbiome from what we found on the

1013
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,440
floors and the surfaces so we had a

1014
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,159
residual microbial fingerprint and then

1015
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,720
we ran that microbial fingerprint

1016
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:17,199
analysis against 8,000 people in our

1017
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:20,439
database of skin microflora um with also

1018
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,799
with um uh with uh the two students who

1019
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,960
are burgled the house cuz we knew who

1020
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,440
they were right we sent them in and we

1021
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,920
could identify the students with 99 6%

1022
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,440
accuracy based on our 8,000 people the

1023
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,358
microbal fingerprint left over is

1024
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,280
actually slightly better than using

1025
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,838
their genotype um if you just use um you

1026
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,519
know standard genotype fingerprinting

1027
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,078
and not whole genome sequencing so we

1028
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,519
are very excited by that department of

1029
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,839
justice is very excited about that and

1030
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,719
they've funded us and JCP and a few

1031
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,719
other people to expand this into a large

1032
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,799
studies to determine the potential of

1033
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,358
utilizing this kind of uh microbial

1034
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,000
forensics in order to detect crimes in

1035
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,159
in the coming century and if you think

1036
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,559
about the number of people that are put

1037
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,000
in prison on the basis of bite marks or

1038
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,159
uh hair fibers or clothing fibers which

1039
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,920
are for detecting anything

1040
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:10,199
accurately um this might be a valuable

1041
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,079
addition to forensic team's catalog of

1042
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,879
tools in order to get the right the

1043
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,960
wrong people in jail you know what I

1044
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,200
mean but the get the baddies in jail and

1045
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,159
get the keep the um goodies out of jail

1046
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:23,399
um um I just want to point this out

1047
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,759
finally because I got like two minutes

1048
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,599
right maybe a minute um I mapped my

1049
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,800
microbial d in our house this is my

1050
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,318
family I don't give a about IRB

1051
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,440
don't suck it um talking to

1052
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:38,838
Ruth uh and uh I'm even going to go

1053
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,760
worse this is my youngest son let them

1054
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:42,440
fire me this is my youngest son he's

1055
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,920
microbially interacting with the bedroom

1056
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,838
floor he was the only one that really

1057
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,440
had a hand interaction with the bedroom

1058
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,039
floor why because he's crawling around

1059
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,960
on the floor right when he was two years

1060
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,400
old we did the study and so you can see

1061
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,920
these weird little interactions and map

1062
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,599
them when we add dogs into that mix dogs

1063
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,119
significantly increase the microbial

1064
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,119
distribution patterns of the of the home

1065
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,119
they they increase the amount of sharing

1066
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,838
between people my colleague Rob Knight

1067
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,960
showed that if you have dogs in a home

1068
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:07,838
you're more likely to share more

1069
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,679
bacteria than if you don't have dogs and

1070
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,799
we mapped out that interaction over six

1071
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,480
weeks of daily analysis and you can see

1072
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,280
that the dogs do indeed significantly

1073
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,838
increase the diversity and diversity of

1074
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,519
interactions what my wife made me use

1075
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,400
this to rescue a dog from Kentucky his

1076
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,679
name is Captain Bo digley he's a proper

1077
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,039
Southern Captain apparently um and he

1078
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,519
has actually increased the microbial

1079
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,960
diversity of our house only by a small

1080
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,480
margin and our house is n of one but it

1081
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,760
was significant compared to the time

1082
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,800
periods before um and so we think this

1083
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,000
is important because if you introduce

1084
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,240
dogs into a family's home when the child

1085
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,480
is under the age of one they have a 133%

1086
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,000
reduction in the likelihood of

1087
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,679
developing asthma and work from uh

1088
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,719
University of California San Francisco

1089
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,440
has demonstrated that dog bacteria such

1090
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:51,439
as lactobacillus when gavaged into a

1091
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,920
mouse's intestine can significantly

1092
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,800
reduce the likelihood of that Mouse

1093
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,838
having an asthmatic attack okay so these

1094
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,680
intera all suggest that every single one

1095
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,920
of you should go out and rescue I repeat

1096
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:05,239
rescue not buy a dog as soon as you

1097
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,599
possibly can um and I'm going to end

1098
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:09,000
there because I talk about toilets and

1099
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,720
stuff and I got a bit carried away

1100
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,079
but um but I would just like to point

1101
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,480
out um uh we have a new Journal M

1102
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,839
systems I mentioned it anyone that's

1103
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,559
interested in microbial systems biology

1104
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,039
and um you you want to publish in an

1105
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,279
awesome Journal where you get rapid

1106
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,039
decisions blah blah blah um then you can

1107
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
publish in our Journal we have a great

1108
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,838
line of senior editors

1109
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,839
um from across the board kind of the

1110
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:34,440
research areas um we have over 110

1111
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,838
editors and those 110 editors are the

1112
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,480
ones that will handle and make decisions

1113
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,519
for every manuscript so you'll get fast

1114
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,519
rapid decisions and I am on every single

1115
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,639
one of those 110 editors to make sure

1116
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:46,480
that the reviewers uh give out reviews

1117
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,159
in the time frame which they have agreed

1118
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,000
upon so no more waiting around and i'

1119
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:52,759
I've been a senior editor Isme journal

1120
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,719
and environmental microbiology and I

1121
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,839
understand pain so this is my way of

1122
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,399
getting out pain all right

1123
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:59,400
that's it thank

1124
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,000
you 21st century when I change my

1125
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,720
microbiome when I go through house just

1126
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,440
like or or change it afterwards it's not

1127
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,519
based on the structure it's based on the

1128
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,440
composition so no not easily I mean you

1129
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,358
could take V microbiome transplant and

1130
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,000
if you waited long enough you replace

1131
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,880
your mic intestinal microb with somebody

1132
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,039
else's I couldn't like swab myself with

1133
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,519
some CIO back

1134
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,800
it's possible you could do it for a

1135
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:31,960
short period of time but remember your

1136
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,280
skin is not just a surface it's a deep

1137
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,199
contextual environment and um if I

1138
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,640
sterilize your hand right now with an

1139
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:40,078
alcohol WIP in 3 minutes afterwards i'

1140
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,759
be able to detect your unique

1141
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,680
microbiomes it bubbles up back from the

1142
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,800
surface right so we've done that study

1143
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,558
on a number of occasions um they're very

1144
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,800
we're very keen to know that because you

1145
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,839
know the best thing about it is yeah you

1146
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,119
might be a to perturb it but you're not

1147
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,679
very unlikely to be able to change your

1148
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,760
strain level differentiation and unless

1149
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,759
you're wearing hazmat suit you're never

1150
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,160
going to be able to stop it from

1151
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,040
shedding even if you wear gloves it's

1152
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,039
constantly leaving your

1153
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,519
body

1154
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,440
OC

1155
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:18,800
spres yeah

1156
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:21,599
yeah well okay so um uh to be perfectly

1157
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,359
honest um I'm I'm split between this I

1158
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,599
don't think it should be done in in

1159
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:28,440
small children's environments repeat the

1160
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,359
question oh sorry the the question is

1161
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,159
spraying antibiotic cleaning products

1162
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,480
onto surfaces what impact could that be

1163
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,000
having on people's Health man's got all

1164
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,599
that

1165
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,760
mood Terry

1166
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,400
Terry Terry over here on the walles

1167
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,200
matter so um so pretend pretend the

1168
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,880
lights oh there um good pretending um so

1169
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,118
what we're most interested in is trying

1170
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,119
to see if it affects Health okay and we

1171
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,880
see no real implications between health

1172
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,480
because as I said is if you use these

1173
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,800
things and then you and then you

1174
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,838
interact with something you're picking

1175
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,119
up a microb your microbiome surface is

1176
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,279
pretty fast we do know that certain

1177
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,480
cleaning products things with trickers

1178
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,400
an can have a potential impact and they

1179
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,760
might have some hormonal impact although

1180
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,880
that's still tenuous I don't have any

1181
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,559
conflict of interest with any of the

1182
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,160
companies that manufacture these things

1183
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,599
but I would say that in infant

1184
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,480
developing I think it's dangerous to

1185
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,079
sterilize the environment as much as we

1186
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,159
do I think we should actually be

1187
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,119
increasing their interactions and we

1188
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,239
work with armish hutterite families who

1189
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,599
you the armish live on personal Family

1190
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,439
Farms the kids always interact with the

1191
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,838
animals the Hutterites don't only boys

1192
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,200
over the age of 14 are allowed on the

1193
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,078
farm they're both from the same

1194
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:39,960
ancestral population they both live a

1195
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,920
very similar lifestyle apart from that

1196
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,000
one removal of a microbial source and

1197
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,119
the hites the arish have virtually no

1198
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,119
asthma in their population of 35,000

1199
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,640
people we look at the Hutterites have

1200
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:53,200
30% Asma in their their population could

1201
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,199
be doed something else but a remarkable

1202
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,239
coincidence so I would say increasing

1203
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,558
the biological diversity in a world

1204
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,439
where we can control pathogens through

1205
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,040
uh vaccines and and control um measures

1206
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,240
with our community and our environment

1207
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,119
we should actually be increasing our

1208
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:08,558
microbial diversity through interaction

1209
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,599
with the natural world rather than

1210
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:16,960
decreasing it off

1211
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:20,559
my um come out autis also um can you

1212
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,318
like extend that concept you can I I I

1213
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,920
have an autistic son so I'm slightly

1214
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,719
biased in this respect um my uh I

1215
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,440
honestly believe that um that there is a

1216
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,480
significant link between microbial

1217
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,519
dysbiosis in the child's gut especially

1218
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,480
early in life and development of the

1219
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,920
brain we we have some evidence that

1220
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,760
haven't published yet in rats to

1221
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,599
demonstrate this and work with from

1222
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,440
sarus mazmanian and Paul pson out of

1223
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,480
Caltech has demonstrated significant

1224
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,679
link between um a Model A Mouse model of

1225
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,240
autism and the addition of a probiotic

1226
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,239
in order to alleviate that now what is a

1227
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:53,959
mouse model of autism you got ask

1228
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,838
yourself that question deep but um you

1229
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,400
know the the the m do show some very

1230
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:00,279
interesting neurological behaviors and

1231
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,119
physiological disturbances which are

1232
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,760
very similar to what we see in autistic

1233
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,519
children and the probiotic does tend to

1234
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,960
alleviate those conditions so they're

1235
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:10,079
moving forward with the phase two trial

1236
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,838
now looking at its introduction into a

1237
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,160
human population so I I have hope that

1238
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,318
we can rebalance people's systems but I

1239
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:18,920
just want to point out um I'm slightly

1240
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:21,039
biased because my side is perfect just

1241
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,119
the way he is and I actually embrace

1242
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,519
neurological diversity in our community

1243
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,119
in a way that I think a lot of people

1244
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,400
are scared to do because the the other

1245
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,960
is a little bit too different and they

1246
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,559
don't like it um maybe academics this is

1247
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,240
the Right audience to talk about that

1248
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,760
right but um uh so I I'm actually not

1249
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,799
trying to Kure my son and I wouldn't try

1250
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,280
and change him for the world but uh I

1251
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,440
know there are other people who are

1252
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,200
desperately in need of uh an improvement

1253
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,200
in their quality of

1254
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:57,480
life yes where is the science out in

1255
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,879
modifying uh in any of them um question

1256
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,480
what is the where is the science at in

1257
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,000
modifying microbiomes um let me move it

1258
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,199
out of humans for a second and into

1259
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,519
soils because I think that's an

1260
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,639
interesting one uh I I do have a

1261
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:10,639
conflict of interest in this And the

1262
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:12,799
fact I have an interest in um gr centia

1263
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,239
Matt wallenstein company which produces

1264
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,119
a probiotic to increase your bud growth

1265
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:21,799
for those cannabis Growers out there you

1266
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,800
want big buds to make you higher then go

1267
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,239
with in in that instance we've

1268
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,760
demonstrated that in order to actually

1269
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:32,399
um allow those bacteria that we

1270
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,319
introduce into the soil of these plants

1271
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,280
to have a significant ability to

1272
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,599
colonize we have to disrupt the

1273
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,040
ecosystem and reduce the stable

1274
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:41,760
associations between the existing

1275
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:43,639
microbes the best way to do that from

1276
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,440
our perspective is to add more carbon

1277
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:48,118
different carbon substrates into the

1278
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,639
soil system prior and it shakes up the

1279
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,358
status quo and then you add your

1280
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,480
probiotic and Bing bam boom some of them

1281
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,960
start to take over Matt doesn't want to

1282
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,480
know that cuz then they're in the soil

1283
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,000
and he doesn't have to add more of his

1284
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,079
product which would make him poorer so

1285
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,960
that's not cool but theoretically the

1286
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,440
same is true for human intestines or

1287
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,119
buildings or whatever environment you're

1288
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,760
interested in um we disrupt the initial

1289
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,640
ecosystem and then add and overlayer it

1290
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,160
with a new one vehicle microbiome

1291
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:18,679
transplant works exactly like that

1292
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,519
ostensibly with a little bit of hand we

1293
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:22,039
yes just a followup up on that so I

1294
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:23,759
think that's it's interesting that you

1295
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:26,079
say that and I think that contradicts

1296
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,599
the Cannabis growth well that too but uh

1297
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,559
I think that contradicts what one of the

1298
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,880
things we were doing with the

1299
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,119
hindcasting right so I think I agree

1300
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,318
with you that when you have a community

1301
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,358
it's sort of sometimes hard to push that

1302
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:38,880
equilibrium to a new state but yet when

1303
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:40,199
you run that H casting you're saying

1304
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,400
that these climate variables are just

1305
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:44,039
going to change the community to respond

1306
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,440
to that new climate instantly without

1307
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,279
the memory of the system well no so it

1308
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,119
takes 30 years for it to change right um

1309
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,960
so I'm I guess I'm saying with the hind

1310
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,599
casting that it takes you know if the

1311
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,519
climate is this it's going to take 30

1312
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,680
years for that equilibri to reshift

1313
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:00,960
probably due to a change in plant

1314
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:02,919
biodiversity in the above ground system

1315
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,838
what I guess I guess what I'm going at

1316
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,480
with that that trending is an an ability

1317
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:10,599
to understand the variance in the

1318
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,400
parameters of the system like the human

1319
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,880
gut is never going to change to an

1320
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,358
environment where it looks like open

1321
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,358
ocean right um you know it can't it has

1322
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:21,159
to stay within certain bounds and many

1323
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,920
soil systems are the same so if I'm

1324
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,039
looking at a prairie it has bounds of

1325
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,480
influence it's it's very hard go outside

1326
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:29,279
of those bounds we don't necessarily

1327
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,199
know what those bounds are but if we

1328
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,000
sample through the parameter variance

1329
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,838
space we may be able to capture those

1330
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,798
bounds and if we can link the parameter

1331
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,480
variance based to what the climate does

1332
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:42,400
to the microbiome or even indirectly or

1333
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,000
directly we can have at least an ability

1334
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,240
to predict the variance in that in in

1335
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,480
the microbiome space the structural

1336
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:51,479
space Sorry the structural space off

1337
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,599
that microbiome in that system within

1338
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,719
the bounds of reality but you're right

1339
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,960
in the fact that I can't hcast back 150

1340
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,838
years or even even 100 years as in the

1341
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,440
napole system one and actually be

1342
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:07,679
accurate but I'm only utilizing that to

1343
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:11,200
demonstrate the opportunity to identify

1344
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:14,798
how similar Trends exist irrespective of

1345
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:17,239
my ability to predict it um if you will

1346
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:21,239
it's trying to identify an underlying

1347
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:23,719
current of uh of of of um uh of

1348
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:25,879
information which predicts a an emerging

1349
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:28,118
property which I don't necessarily yet

1350
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,559
understand um and we can do that with

1351
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:33,240
reasonable accuracy I think even if it's

1352
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,280
within the bounds of uh predictability

1353
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,558
all right I want to thank our speaker
