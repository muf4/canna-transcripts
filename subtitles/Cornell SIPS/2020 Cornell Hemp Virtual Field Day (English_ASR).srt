1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,878
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,878
university

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,800
okay it's 901 uh let's get started

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,439
welcome again everyone uh to our

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
cornell hemp research team virtual field

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,879
day

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
it's a beautiful day here in upstate new

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,759
york and i wish you

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,598
all could be here we would have had a

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
perfect day in the field

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,640
but i'm going to look at the silver

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,079
lining

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,359
and that is that we are now up to 213

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719
attendees

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,960
uh already matching what we had last

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
year and that was our max capacity of

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,789
our

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,960
field facilities we've also been able to

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,600
[Music]

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
encourage the participation of people

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
across the country and perhaps around

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
the world

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,359
through this virtual format so i think

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:03,599
we're going to have a broader impact

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,840
we have a good lineup of speakers today

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
we you see we've broken up the session

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
the program into three sessions

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,118
the first one on hemp reading and

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,200
genetics second on crop management

30
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,319
and the third on supply chains and

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
regulatory updates

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
some of those presentations will be made

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
live some are pre-recorded

34
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,319
and i will play those through my

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
computer we've allowed

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,399
a five-minute break at the end of each

37
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,478
hour because we've realized now with

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,040
these long zoom meetings that

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,879
people need uh to take a break for a few

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,079
minutes get a cup of coffee

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,759
use the restroom etc so

42
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,359
i also want to thank our uh support from

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
texas international

44
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,519
and some of my colleagues from pixas are

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
on as well

46
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,118
they have sponsored our research now for

47
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,679
the second season

48
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,159
and have made a strong commitment to

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,360
extension and outreach to

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,960
hemp growers across the country so again

51
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,239
i want to thank them

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,878
so without further ado i'm going to turn

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,959
the screen over to

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,598
my graduate student george stack who is

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,080
starting the second year of his phd

56
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,959
who is going to give you a presentation

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,000
about

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,840
some of our cannabinoid hemp

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
trials george

60
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,039
okay can everybody hear me fire can you

61
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,519
hear me yep i hear you well

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,519
okay

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
and you can see my screen yep looks

64
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,199
perfect

65
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,280
okay as larry said my name is george

66
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,119
stack and i'm starting the second year

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,640
of my phd in this lab at cornell

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
agritech today i'm going to be talking

69
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,518
to you about

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
our high cannabinoid hemp cultivar

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,800
trials from 2019

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,680
and 2020. before i kind of dig

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,159
in i'd like to bring up two points one

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,280
is that i have posted two fact sheets

75
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,439
on our website one about the 2019 trial

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
and one about the 2020 trial so there's

77
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,759
data that i'm going to be presenting in

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,919
this talk as well as additional data

79
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,280
that you can check out there and the

80
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,439
second thing i'd like to bring up

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,080
is that when i talk about thc in this

82
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,318
talk i'm talking about total thc

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
so this is a regulatory issue that i

84
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,359
don't really have time to dig into right

85
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,399
now but we'll hopefully

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,519
discuss uh it later in the

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
in the field day excuse me um

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,799
so before i talk about the data we need

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
to understand

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
why different cannabis plants accumulate

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
different cannabinoids

92
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,479
and it comes down to this cannabinoid

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,199
biosynthetic pathway right here

94
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,039
i'm going to put my pointer on so we're

95
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,199
starting with these precursor compounds

96
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,840
that get converted into cbga

97
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,359
and then the cbga can get converted into

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,719
either cbda

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,080
by the cbda synthase enzyme in the plant

100
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,680
or thca by the thc a synthase enzyme in

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,840
the plant

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
and the combination of these two enzymes

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
that a plant has really dictate

104
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,518
what cannabinoids it's going to

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,640
accumulate so you can imagine

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,480
if we have a thca synthase enzyme but no

107
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,199
cbda synthase enzyme

108
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,679
the plant will accumulate thc and this

109
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
is called

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,918
chemotype 1. if we have both

111
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
a thca synthase enzyme and a cbda

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,839
synthase enzyme we'll accumulate both

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,160
cbda and thca this is called chemotype

114
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,879
2. if we have just a cbda synthase

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
enzyme

116
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,719
and no thca synthase enzyme will

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,918
accumulate cbd

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
this is called chemotype 3 and if we

119
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,120
have

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,478
neither a cbda synthase enzyme nor a

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,959
thca synthase enzyme will accumulate cbg

122
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,879
and this is how you get these high cbg

123
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,478
varieties and this is called chemotype

124
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,399
4.

125
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,279
so let's look at this in the context of

126
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,439
our 2019 cbd cultivar trial

127
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,478
this trial was replicated at two sites

128
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,879
one in geneva

129
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,758
and one in ithaca at each of these sites

130
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,199
we had 30 cultivars replicated

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
and so one of the questions that we can

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
ask about the trial is what chemotypes

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,240
showed up in this 2019

134
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,719
trial were all of the plants chemotype 3

135
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,639
high cbd plants as we would expect if

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
we're trying to produce cbd

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
and the answer to that question is no so

138
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,279
at least 7 of the 30 cultivars were not

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
all chemotype 3.

140
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,000
so this is some cannabinoid data from

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,879
one cultivar that had chemotypes 1

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,319
2 and 3 individuals in it and you can

143
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,120
see that the chemotype 1

144
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,719
and chemotype 2 individuals accumulated

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,759
a lot of thc

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,680
and exceeded the regulatory threshold so

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,240
this is a real problem that growers are

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,478
being sold chemotype 1 and 2 plants when

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,160
they're expecting chemotype 3 plants and

150
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,839
it causes them to be not compliant

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
the second question that we asked was

152
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,000
how do cannabinoids accumulate

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
over time and we did this by taking

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
shoot tip samples

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
weekly after terminal flowering for all

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,918
of the 30 cultivars

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
and when we look at the data it looks

158
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,839
like this so let's look at cbd

159
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,799
accumulation over time we have c

160
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,239
total potential cbd on our y-axis here

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
and we have weeks after terminal

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
flowering on our x-axis

163
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
each of these lines is a different one

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
of the cultivars

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
and shows how it accumulates cbd over

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,038
time

167
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,199
so you can see that for most cultivars

168
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,719
they accumulate quite a lot of cbd

169
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,800
in the weeks immediately following

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
terminal flowering and this makes sense

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
because most of the cannabinoids are

172
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,478
concentrated

173
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,839
in the trichomes of the female flowers

174
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,758
what's really interesting though is when

175
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,038
you compare this graph of cbd

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
accumulation

177
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,279
to the graph of thc accumulation and

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,038
i'll just flip back and forth between

179
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,959
these slides a few times here

180
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,560
and you can see that the curves for each

181
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,719
of the cultivars are almost

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,959
identical it's just the scales are

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
different so the scale for the cbd graph

184
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,680
was 0 to 20

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
and the scale for this thc graph is 0 to

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,360
0.6

187
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,318
and the reason the curves are so similar

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
is because

189
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,960
cbd and thc accumulation are coupled

190
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,719
in high cbd plants at a fixed ratio

191
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,719
and unfortunately that means these

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,000
cultivars here that accumulated

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,840
high levels of cbd also accumulated

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,319
enough thc to be above this 0.3

195
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,839
total thc legal threshold which leaves

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
us a very small window

197
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,839
to do regulatory testing and harvest

198
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
before our cultivars become not

199
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,318
compliant

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,478
and when we look at this cbd to thc

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,039
ratio across all of our cultivars we

202
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,079
have

203
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,240
cbd to thc ratio on our y-axis here

204
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,079
our cultivars on our x-axis we see that

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,038
it's pretty consistent for most

206
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,159
cultivars

207
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:49,279
between a 20 to 1 ratio and 31

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,160
30 to 1 ratio excuse me and that means

209
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,719
that at a 0.3 percent total thc

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
threshold uh on average we can only

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
accumulate about

212
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,720
seven to eight percent total cbd before

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,400
a plant becomes not compliant the third

214
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
thing i'd like to talk about is when

215
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,478
these plants flowered and the variation

216
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,399
in flowering time

217
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,560
so in this graph here you can see our

218
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,598
cultivars on the y-axis

219
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,079
and the date on the x-axis this vertical

220
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,639
line

221
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,639
is when we transplanted and uh you can

222
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,319
see that these bars indicate when each

223
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
of the cultivars flowered

224
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
so we had some that flowered in june

225
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
some in july

226
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,878
some in august some in september and one

227
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,120
even in october

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,918
and i've added these circle x's to show

229
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,959
when these cultivars exceeded the 0.3

230
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,519
total thc legal threshold and you can

231
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,319
see

232
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,120
that it's very strongly correlated and

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,800
has this

234
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,360
this one two maybe four week window

235
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,079
between terminal flowering and exceeding

236
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,639
the thc

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,399
threshold for most cultivars

238
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,480
in summary i'm going to talk about

239
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,919
considerations for staying thc compliant

240
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
with growing for cbd

241
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,679
the first thing we talked about were the

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,919
different chemotypes of cannabis

243
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,039
and how when we're producing cbd we

244
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,559
really want chemotype 3 plants

245
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,480
the second thing we talked about was the

246
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,919
cannabinoid accumulation curves

247
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
and so i'm going to stress the

248
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,919
importance of regular testing

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
to make sure that you know where you are

250
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,039
on that curve and that you're staying

251
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,519
under the 0.3

252
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,319
legal threshold and the third thing i

253
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320
mentioned

254
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
was that flowering was very strongly

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
correlated with

256
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
cannabinoid accumulation which makes

257
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,799
sense because cannabinoids are

258
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,720
accumulated in the trichomes

259
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,079
of the female flowers so monitoring

260
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,879
flowering time

261
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,560
is a really good management strategy for

262
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,360
staying under that thc

263
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,000
threshold now i'm going to briefly talk

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,680
about our

265
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
cultivar trials from this year so we

266
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,079
have a cbd cultivar

267
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
trial and a cvg cultivar trial so this

268
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,600
is

269
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,639
chemotype 3 and chemotype 4.

270
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
again we've replicated at two sites one

271
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,000
in geneva

272
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,000
and one in ithaca so just to circle

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,958
around here

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,480
in geneva we have a cbd trial with 40

275
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,679
different cultivars in it

276
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,440
and we also have a cbg trial with 12

277
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,599
different cultivars in it

278
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
and over here in ithaca we have a

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,759
replicated

280
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,759
cbd trial with 32 of the cultivars in it

281
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,759
and we also have a direct seeded

282
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,919
essential oil hemp trial which is a

283
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,559
multi-state trial organized by oregon

284
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,360
state

285
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,559
and this has nine cultivars in it so

286
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,200
i'll just share some

287
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,159
preliminary data here from our cbd and

288
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,839
cvg

289
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,919
cultivar trials so as of monday 21 of

290
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
the 52 cultivars have started to

291
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,199
terminally flower

292
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
and i've represented that that flowering

293
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,360
time in this plot over here

294
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,199
so this is called a violin plot and it

295
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,720
shows the distribution

296
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,839
of flowering over the course of

297
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
the last two months or so and you can

298
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
see

299
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,278
that some cultivars seem to have several

300
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,838
distinct

301
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,639
groups of flowering time some early some

302
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
late

303
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,480
several appear to flower just over the

304
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,319
course of multiple weeks but not be

305
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,200
really separated into groups

306
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,480
and some all flower very consistently at

307
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,360
the same time

308
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,000
so it'll be interesting to see how these

309
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
cultivars

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,360
continue to mature over the rest of the

311
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
growing season and how

312
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,480
the other 31 cultivars that haven't

313
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,679
flowered yet

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,278
will fit into this scheme so i'll just

315
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,719
say thank you to all the people who

316
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,919
contributed to this research

317
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,519
and our funding sources please put your

318
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,439
questions in the chat

319
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
and i'd be happy to answer them and this

320
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,959
is my contact info if you'd like to talk

321
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,839
more about him

322
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:43,838
thank you

323
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,838
that's great thanks very much george

324
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,559
we're going to try to get

325
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,399
on time here and make sure that my

326
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,439
sharing of the videos here

327
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,958
is working we have time for q

328
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,480
a at the end of the hour so i think

329
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,958
there will be plenty of time for george

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,680
to answer your questions

331
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,559
so it's my pleasure now to introduce

332
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,679
jacob toth

333
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:13,199
another phd student in my lab

334
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:17,278
who will give you a complimentary talk

335
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,879
on our molecular breeding for a

336
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,879
compliant fiber type

337
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,480
hello and welcome everybody to the

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,879
cornell hemp field days my name is jacob

339
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,879
toast and i'm a phd candidate in larry's

340
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,879
smart clap and today i'll be talking

341
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,879
about molecular bleeding of hemp

342
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,278
for my talk today i'll be discussing

343
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,278
some of the

344
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,320
theory and ideas behind molecular

345
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,919
breeding attempt

346
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
and give an example of how we're using

347
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,000
molecular breeding in our research

348
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,959
program to develop a high yielding

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
fiber cultivar that has low levels of

350
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,439
thc to stay compliant as well as produce

351
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,440
high levels of cbd

352
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
it is important to recognize the

353
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
contribution of genetics and environment

354
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,200
to your trait of interest

355
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,078
for any breeding endeavor so how the

356
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
plant grows

357
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,519
the phenotype is there about there's the

358
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
result of both

359
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,440
the genetics of the plant as well as the

360
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
environment

361
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
the genetics of the plant also known as

362
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,320
the genotype

363
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:23,039
refers to the dna of the plants

364
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
the genes and other dna which make up

365
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,319
the plant's genome

366
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,160
so many important traits such as yields

367
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
are heavily influenced by both the

368
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,159
genotype and the environment

369
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,000
but some traits such as photoperiod

370
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,278
dependence and cannabinoid

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,120
are heavily influenced by genotype alone

372
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,799
concerning photoperiod dependence if you

373
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,879
look at this picture here

374
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,039
the small plant is photoperiod

375
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,600
independent and started flowering

376
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,719
almost immediately after planting while

377
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
the larger plant

378
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,800
which is fully period dependent didn't

379
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,559
start flowering until

380
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,719
the night length hit a certain threshold

381
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,399
so another important trait that is

382
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,680
influenced heavily by genotype

383
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,440
in cannabis is cannabinoid type and

384
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,679
breeding for cannabinoid type is a

385
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,680
fundamental part of any hemp breeding

386
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,600
so what is molecular breeding so

387
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,439
in molecular breeding very broadly

388
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,278
instead of just looking at the phenotype

389
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
of the plant which is the result of both

390
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:30,240
the genotype and the environment

391
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,880
you look at the actual dna

392
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
so advances in molecular biology have

393
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,879
allowed

394
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,240
much easier analysis of dna

395
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,720
and because the dna is the same in every

396
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,799
cell

397
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,079
of a plant whether it's young or whether

398
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,319
it's old

399
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,838
being able to assay a plant just by

400
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,240
looking at the dna allows you

401
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
to look at certain traits before they're

402
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,159
even expressed

403
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,838
for instance to determine if a plant is

404
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,480
going to be male or female or if it's

405
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,040
going to produce mostly thc or mostly

406
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,199
cbd

407
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,838
[Music]

408
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,519
so with molecular breeding you can

409
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,360
develop new cultivars based on the

410
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,639
genotype alone

411
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,360
and when done accurately this can result

412
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,839
in less expensive phenotyping

413
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,440
and ultimately reducing the cost and

414
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,120
reducing the time it takes

415
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
to develop a new cultivar

416
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,799
now i'm going to talk a little bit about

417
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,799
how our research group is using

418
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,000
molecular breeding to develop

419
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:35,359
new elite high yielding fiber cultivars

420
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,919
that have compliant levels of thc

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
in 2019 we grew several varieties for

422
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,360
grain and fiber production

423
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,758
including two cultivars from china

424
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,879
called dama and puma

425
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
we didn't know much about these

426
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,759
cultivars when we first planted them

427
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,480
aside from

428
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
a little blurb for puma which claimed to

429
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,759
have

430
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,599
high cbd seeds high leaves and flowers

431
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,199
output

432
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
when these plants were grown we were

433
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,799
quite impressed by the plants

434
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,040
in that they had extremely large leaves

435
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,639
and extremely fast growth rate

436
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,480
and would routinely hit 10 feet tall

437
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
when we harvested these plants and

438
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,120
breaded them to measure the fiber yields

439
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,600
we found that vaman puma had nearly

440
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,399
doubled the biomass yield of other elite

441
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,240
cultivars grown for fiber

442
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,720
because of this we thought that the puma

443
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,799
would make excellent fiber cultivators

444
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,399
however when we looked at the

445
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,958
cannabinoids

446
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,720
we found that both puma and bama

447
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:36,638
produced thc at levels exceeding 0.3

448
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,839
and would be non-compliant in the modern

449
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
regulatory framework

450
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,240
we looked further at the cannabinoids

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,919
that puma and bama were producing and we

452
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,039
found that they were relatively high in

453
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,360
cannabinoids

454
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,078
with puma producing a little over 1.5

455
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
percent

456
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,599
total cannabinoids and dama sometimes

457
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,039
exceeding 2

458
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,159
total cannabinoids this is considerably

459
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,198
higher than

460
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,278
what other fiber cultivars produced in

461
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,599
terms of total cannabinoids

462
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,679
additionally we sampled these plants

463
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,078
when they were just starting to flower

464
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,199
so we hypothesized that as the plant

465
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,798
became more mature

466
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,919
the total cannabinoids would increase

467
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:19,359
even further however the big problem was

468
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,640
that puma and bama produced

469
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,318
thc as a major cannabinoid which isn't

470
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,959
what we wanted so ultimately

471
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,279
what we would like in a cultivar would

472
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
be something that produces as much dry

473
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,279
biomass as

474
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,240
puma and bama but instead of producing

475
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,000
thc

476
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,759
produces cbd and to achieve that goal

477
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,759
we turn to molecular breeding

478
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
so to understand what we did for

479
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,719
molecular breeding it's first

480
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
important to understand the different

481
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,279
chemotypes that are found

482
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
in cannabis so there are

483
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,558
three important chemotypes that i'll

484
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
talk about right now there's type 1

485
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,720
which is

486
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,720
mostly thc there's type 2 which is cbd

487
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,000
to thc at about a 2

488
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,160
1 ratio but this number can vary

489
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,480
and then there's type 3 which produces

490
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,038
mostly cbd

491
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
so if you're growing a population or a

492
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,480
cultivar

493
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
for cbd you'd expect all the plants to

494
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,640
be type 3

495
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
but in 2018 and 2019 we found that some

496
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,720
of the plants

497
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:29,119
that we were growing were in fact type 2

498
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,200
or even type 1 producing almost no cbd

499
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,399
using this data and this figure in the

500
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,679
top here shows

501
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,440
data from 2018 we developed a molecular

502
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
marker which looks at the dna of the

503
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
plants

504
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
and can distinguish type 1 from type 2

505
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,960
and type

506
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,080
3 planets so getting back to bama and

507
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
puma

508
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,279
when we were looking at the thc to cbd

509
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,200
ratio

510
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:56,319
for these plants we saw that it was

511
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,240
about a 2 1 ratio of cbd to thc

512
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,079
which would suggest that most of the

513
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,120
plants that we were sampling

514
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,038
were type 2 so an interesting thing

515
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,279
about these type 2 plants is that they

516
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,599
won't breed true

517
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,359
if there's a population which is freely

518
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,599
inter-crossing with a lot of these type

519
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,000
2 plants you'd expect to see

520
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,439
a certain number to be type 1 and a

521
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,480
certain number to be type

522
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,600
3. so we didn't have the

523
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,319
hplc the chemical data on a lot of

524
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,159
different

525
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,558
plants from bama and puma we were just

526
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,519
looking at pooled samples

527
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,918
but we could apply this molecular marker

528
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,918
to

529
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,200
these populations and distinguish the

530
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,320
different plants

531
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,319
that were in these different chemotypes

532
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,639
so late last year around december we

533
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,240
grew about a hundred plants each of bama

534
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,759
and puma and tested them with this

535
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,839
marker that we developed

536
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,960
and as expected we found that about half

537
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,359
of the plants

538
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,798
were type two and we found that about a

539
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,558
third of the plants were type

540
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,079
three and then the remainder were type

541
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,279
one

542
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,000
so what we did was we selected the type

543
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,319
three

544
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,679
and in theory these plants should form

545
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,359
an excellent basis

546
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:11,840
for a high producing fiber cultivar

547
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,839
that produces mostly cbd

548
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
however after selection of these type 3

549
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,839
plants

550
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
we run into a few problems with their

551
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,119
propagation so these plants which are so

552
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,440
vigorous in the field are also very

553
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,119
vigorous in a greenhouse

554
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
and they grew extremely fast and

555
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,359
extremely tall sometimes in excess of 14

556
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,919
feet they were also quite susceptible

557
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,000
to various greenhouse pathogens such as

558
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,799
thrips and spider mites

559
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,880
to make matters worse they appear to be

560
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,519
very photoperiod dependent

561
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,919
and did not flower in the greenhouse in

562
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,599
the spring when we were growing them

563
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,960
there were also some issues with cutting

564
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,279
propagation

565
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,720
these plants form a very nice single

566
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,599
stem as you can see in this photo here

567
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,480
but it's not always simple to take a

568
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,240
cutting and root

569
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,159
that very nice stem so to address this

570
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
we're attempting to grow the plants in

571
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,520
the field we've planted them out

572
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,080
and hopefully we'll harvest some grain

573
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,000
at the end of the season which will form

574
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,079
a good basis for scale-up

575
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,119
and we've also sent the cuttings of

576
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,519
these plants

577
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,399
to a collaborator in florida who should

578
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,200
be able

579
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,200
to grow the plants without any issue

580
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,719
in summary molecular breathing involves

581
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,400
selection

582
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,640
on the genotype on the dna directly

583
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,440
familiar and puma two cultivars from

584
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,600
china

585
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,558
are high biomass producers but they

586
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,158
produce high

587
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,798
non-compliant levels of thc

588
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,960
selection in bama and puma for chemotype

589
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,000
3 plants using a molecular marker should

590
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,000
produce

591
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,319
a high yielding compliant thyroculture

592
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,240
these plants here growing in the field

593
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,839
in new york should

594
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
form the basis of a new compliant fiber

595
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,879
cultivar

596
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,120
we hope to harvest the seeds at the end

597
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,760
of the season scale them up

598
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,119
ensure that the resultant plants have

599
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,720
the same biomass

600
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,079
potential as their parent bama and puma

601
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,480
populations

602
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,038
and eventually potentially release new

603
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,038
cultivars

604
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,079
okay thanks very much jacob uh we are

605
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,600
now

606
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,798
going to switch to uh my postdoc

607
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,678
craig carlson uh who is out at the field

608
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,319
in our one of our breeding trials so

609
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,200
craig is going to talk about uh

610
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,399
some f1 hybrids that he has produced and

611
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
show you some of their traits

612
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,359
alrighty larry can you see me

613
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,439
yes we can all right hello everybody

614
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,720
my name is craig carlson i'm a post-doc

615
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,840
with cornell hemp

616
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,839
uh i work on breeding genetics and

617
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,759
genomics of him

618
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,079
and i've got chris smart here with me

619
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,440
recording and we are

620
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,439
more than six feet apart so uh

621
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,720
let's get this uh let's get this thing

622
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,919
rolling

623
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,519
uh so uh if you've been with the hemp

624
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,280
industry for about three or four

625
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,798
years uh you'll know that there is a big

626
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:30,558
need for cultivar development

627
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:33,200
for many years we've seen a

628
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,440
uniformity in the field in grain and

629
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,440
fiber cultivars

630
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,640
but we've also seen a lot of uh

631
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,200
issues with uniformity in uh high

632
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,120
cannabinoid cultivars

633
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
so we're standing in our breeding and

634
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,798
selection trial right now

635
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,480
and this trial consists of 24 families

636
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:59,599
uh of 24 individuals

637
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,919
uh crossed with a common parent tj

638
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,599
and that's owned by stem holdings it's

639
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,320
been kind of our

640
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,240
model hemp plant for the past three or

641
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,038
four years

642
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,720
so typically when we conduct these high

643
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,798
cannabinoid trials

644
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,038
uh we'll space plants about four feet

645
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,720
apart and have about six foot

646
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:24,240
alleys we'll do

647
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,839
weekly measurements of plant height

648
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:32,159
we'll look at leaf area

649
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:35,199
branching angle number of nodes

650
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,880
within the canopy uh plant

651
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,600
canopy width and so we can get a nice

652
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,840
shape descriptor for those individuals

653
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:47,278
that's what i've seen is really lacking

654
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:50,399
in the literature uh is

655
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:54,079
uh uh is

656
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,240
shape descriptors that are very basic

657
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:01,359
right so tree form you know globe shape

658
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,880
columnar etc uh

659
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:09,038
so all of these uh families

660
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,960
have been crossed with tj or an inbred

661
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,960
s1 or s2 of tj what i want to show you

662
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,720
is how some of these phenotypes are

663
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
segregating in these families

664
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,919
because tj is actually quite

665
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,600
heterozygous

666
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,640
uh but the parents are heterozygous to

667
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,678
more inbred i want to show you kind of

668
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,919
what our important traits

669
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,919
are doing in the field and

670
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,720
the differences between crossing

671
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,240
heterozygous with heterozygous

672
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,519
and heterozygous with inbred material so

673
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,880
if we can get chris to move over here

674
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:52,400
uh this this row right here is

675
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,760
a tj's s2 meaning that we

676
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,798
self tjs using sts

677
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:02,720
to produce pollen silver thiosulfate

678
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:05,519
selected an individual and then

679
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,000
self that progeny from that individual

680
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,519
so it's an s2 population

681
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,599
and what i was going for with this

682
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,480
family was to select an s1

683
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,359
that looked a lot more like the parent

684
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,159
uh

685
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,479
but what we are finding out what we have

686
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,880
found

687
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,919
out is that uh tj's actually

688
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,240
heterozygous

689
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,759
for a flowering time gene

690
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,120
and so this is an s2 family in this row

691
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,558
and what we see is that a lot of these

692
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,079
early flowering

693
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:41,119
individuals are fairly uniform

694
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,399
and many of the later flowering

695
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:48,239
individuals are fairly uniform

696
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,440
so there is some uniformity but

697
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,000
it's just so dramatic what differences

698
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,600
in flowering

699
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,038
time can do to a family

700
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,599
so if we want to come over here chris

701
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,480
we're going to look at another family

702
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,480
another s2

703
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:11,759
and okay

704
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,079
all right chris this is this is tj this

705
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,400
is

706
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,199
that common parent of all of these up

707
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,320
ones

708
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,080
it has a really irregular shape to it

709
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,558
kind of drooping leaves it's a high

710
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:26,398
cannabinoid uh

711
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,359
hemp type i also in that s1 made a

712
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,639
selection

713
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,639
of a early flowering individual

714
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,240
so it's kind of homozygous for that

715
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,080
flowering time gene

716
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,079
and as you can see it's far more uniform

717
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,240
besides differences really in maybe

718
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,278
plant size

719
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,079
but small differences in plant size

720
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,839
and it's far more uniform that than that

721
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,678
other s1 that was segregating for the

722
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,599
flowering time locus

723
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:02,640
there are some uh really interesting

724
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:05,678
uh families uh

725
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,840
yeah okay they got dropped again uh

726
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,798
so we are going to move on uh to our

727
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,359
next presentation

728
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,240
chris we're gonna move on yeah we're

729
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,839
gonna move on

730
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,839
we're gonna move on

731
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,599
okay uh and craig is gonna run into the

732
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,720
uh office here so he can join our q a

733
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:33,918
uh so our next presentation is from

734
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,159
jamie crawford good morning uh

735
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,840
who will be talking about our grain and

736
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,880
fiber trials

737
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:45,759
uh mostly in ithaca

738
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,600
so let me get that going for you

739
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,440
good morning everyone my name is jamie

740
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,079
crawford and i'll be giving you a brief

741
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,360
update

742
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,199
on our hemp grain and fiber trials

743
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,119
our trial design is a randomized

744
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
complete block where each entry is

745
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,199
replicated four times

746
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,200
plots are four feet wide and 20 feet

747
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,798
long and seating rate is calculated

748
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,840
based on the germination rate

749
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,759
and seed weight of each entry so the 25

750
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,439
seeds are planted per square foot in the

751
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,839
grain in dual trials

752
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,080
and 40 live seeds are planted per square

753
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,839
foot in the fiber trials

754
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,199
complete hemp grain and fiber reports

755
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,839
for each year can be found on our

756
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,759
website

757
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,639
but this graph shows the range of grain

758
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:28,000
yields in ithaca and geneva by year

759
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,559
the yields for 2017 and 2019 were quite

760
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
similar

761
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,319
ranging from seven to eight hundred

762
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,240
pounds per acre

763
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,678
for the lower yielding entries to

764
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,759
thirteen hundred to fourteen hundred

765
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,038
pounds per acre in the higher yielding

766
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,480
entries

767
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,759
decrease in yield in 2018 was due to the

768
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,839
timing of harvest

769
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,519
one location was harvested too early

770
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,918
before grain was mature

771
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,679
in all entries and one location was

772
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,080
harvested too late with much of the

773
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,200
grain lost to shattering our birds when

774
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,398
harvesting for grain

775
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,360
timing is very important fiber yields in

776
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,038
2017 were low due to poor seed quality

777
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,199
and very thin stands

778
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,519
with new higher germinating seed lots in

779
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,120
2018 and 2019

780
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,679
entries were yielding between five and

781
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,199
six dry tons per acre before reading

782
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,880
and two and a half to three and a half

783
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,600
dry tons per acre after

784
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,840
reading we established grain and fiber

785
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,480
trials in two locations this spring

786
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,359
the first in geneva planted on june 4th

787
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,640
and the second

788
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,879
planted in ithaca on june 6th ithaca had

789
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,399
received six tenths of an inch more rain

790
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,559
than in geneva

791
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:34,398
in the two weeks leading up to planting

792
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,879
and this made a huge difference in the

793
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,119
success of the trials

794
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
because the field was so dry when it was

795
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,398
prepped for planting

796
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,079
hard baked chunks of soil limited seed

797
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:45,759
soil contact

798
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,359
had we received the predicted rain it

799
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,278
could have been okay but the lack of

800
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,199
rain in the weeks after planting led to

801
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,079
poor emergence and then the trial was

802
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,880
overrun by

803
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,158
weeds the additional soil moisture at

804
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
the ithaca location

805
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
led to a finer seed bed excellent

806
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,200
emergence and what should have been an

807
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,000
excellent stand if our cone cedar hadn't

808
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,038
been slowly

809
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,960
breaking as we were planting

810
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,798
while we were planting the ithaca trials

811
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
the load bar which supported the packer

812
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,398
wheels was slowly twisting

813
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,159
planting some of the rose more deeply

814
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,639
and packing the soil over top of them

815
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,278
very

816
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,000
firmly we planted the fiber trial first

817
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,319
that day

818
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,759
and all six roads emerged but by the

819
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,639
last plot planted that day

820
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,759
only two rows emerged as expected the

821
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
planter was repaired

822
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,000
and then the grain and dual purpose

823
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,278
trials were replanted on june 24th

824
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,278
since these hemp varieties are

825
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,599
photoperiod sensitive

826
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,359
planting later leads to shorter plants

827
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,038
the tops of the signs in both pictures

828
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,798
are 30 inches from the ground

829
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,319
piccolo plant at the beginning of june

830
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,158
is close to four feet tall

831
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,839
piccolo planted the end of june is two

832
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,600
and a half feet tall

833
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,439
canola is over five feet tall in the

834
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,199
original planting and not quite four

835
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,278
feet tall in the replant

836
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,640
we expect the grain yields to be similar

837
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,558
between these trials

838
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,799
but shorter entries are more susceptible

839
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,480
to weed pressure

840
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,839
for my remaining time i'd like to show

841
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,159
you some pictures of

842
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,319
our trials here in ithaca new york we'll

843
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,960
start out with the fiber trial

844
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,798
the fiber trial was planted on june 6th

845
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,319
so it's from the original planting

846
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,798
and has four entries there are two new

847
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,599
entries this year the one on the left is

848
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,319
called yuma crossbow we had some

849
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,918
conflicting

850
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,599
information on whether it should be

851
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,880
included in the dual purpose or the

852
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,719
fiber trial

853
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,159
and as you can see here we made the

854
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,558
wrong choice

855
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,760
it's actually earlier flowering than

856
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,278
some of the entries

857
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,679
in our dual purpose trials and we will

858
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:43,038
be harvesting it for grain

859
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,798
later this month

860
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:50,158
the other new entry this year is jinma

861
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:52,480
and it is a little bit later maturing

862
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,200
than the italian varieties we have in

863
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,519
the trial as sort of our checks

864
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,840
and it's looking really good so far

865
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,159
our grain trial has eight entries

866
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,959
starting on the left with

867
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:11,200
x59 there's crs-1

868
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,440
in the middle and canda on the right

869
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,000
in this photo that's canada again on the

870
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,640
left followed by uso 31

871
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,519
in the middle and hinola on the right

872
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,720
and then finally this photo has picollo

873
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,159
on the left

874
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,679

875
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,679
2 on the right

876
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:38,879
our dual purpose trials has 15

877
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,600
entries this year there on the left you

878
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,559
can see

879
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:48,158
nwg elite followed by nwg abound

880
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,158
and felina 32

881
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:56,960
in the second slide you see fedora 17

882
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,960
vega and then anka

883
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,399
this slide is futura 75

884
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:10,719
on the left alicia in the middle

885
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,719
and viabretsky on the right

886
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,398
this slide contains variety we're

887
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,598
calling h51

888
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:22,799
on the left ileana in the center

889
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,879
and rigel on the right

890
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,000
the final three entries in our dual

891
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,960
purpose trial

892
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
are altair on the left ferramon in the

893
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,639
middle

894
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,399
and voiko on the right

895
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,159
i'm so disappointed that we can't be

896
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,000
together in person to show off our

897
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,599
trials properly

898
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,358
when we've held field days in the past

899
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,919
i've noticed that people just cannot

900
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,838
help but touch and smell the plants

901
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,039
i can't send the smells of the hemp

902
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,559
field to you

903
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,878
but here is a video of one of our

904
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:56,000
technicians petting the hemp plots

905
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,639
for you to enjoy vicariously and with

906
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,159
that

907
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,160
i'll take any questions

908
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,640
okay thanks very much jamie

909
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,719
that was a great uh look at the

910
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,598
beautiful trials we have this year

911
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,598
in ithaca

912
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,440
unfortunately our trials here in geneva

913
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:18,078
suffered from the drought they don't

914
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,159
look

915
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,680
nearly as pretty as the ones in ithaca

916
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,480
so we have now come to our first q a

917
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,639
session

918
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,838
uh we're right on time so we have 15

919
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,039
minutes for live q

920
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:35,199
a and i am going to

921
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,559
i would encourage the panelists to

922
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,639
unmute their video

923
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,000
and i'm going to go through some of the

924
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,759
excellent questions we got in the chat

925
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,599
and start with uh george for this one

926
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,800
there's a very good question about how

927
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,240
you define

928
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,519
uh the start of flowering and

929
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:58,879
uh what we mean by

930
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,519
terminal flowering versus axillary

931
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
flowering

932
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,559
if you could elaborate on that a little

933
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,320
bit

934
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,838
yeah absolutely that's a great question

935
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
um so

936
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,559
one of the things that's challenging

937
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,559
about female flowering in hemp is that

938
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,320
not all of the cultivars flower in the

939
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,599
exact same way so their

940
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,000
their floral morphology is different um

941
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,920
so we defined terminal flowering as a

942
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,239
cluster of female flowers

943
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,119
at the shoot tips and we found that that

944
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,919
was a pretty

945
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,920
consistent way to mark all of the

946
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,639
cultivars at the same physiological

947
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,599
point

948
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:35,039
i will note that some cultivars do form

949
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,760
axillary flowers

950
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,440
just one single small female flower in

951
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,920
the axles of the leaves

952
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,079
a lot earlier but that is very variable

953
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,000
and is not a great indicator of when the

954
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,000
plants will start terminally flowering

955
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,440
yeah it it can get tricky definitely you

956
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,159
want to get

957
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,159
a loop or some other magnifying glass so

958
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,719
you can look at

959
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,679
the development of the trichomes as well

960
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,239
you want to see

961
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,199
the development from clear trichomes to

962
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,598
milky

963
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,639
and then to amber and that those will be

964
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,359
your cues

965
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,960
as to the uh time of maturity and the

966
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,279
time of harvest

967
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,280
uh jacob i'll point this one to you

968
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,480
there's a question about whether

969
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,040
we are breeding uh cultivars uh that are

970
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,240
high

971
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:28,559
in uh varan cannabinoids

972
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,559
or cbc as an example

973
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:34,960
um yes i'll answer that question so

974
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,640
last year we tested several varieties

975
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,199
and especially a few from china

976
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,719
had quite high variant concentrations

977
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,159
but just like as i was talking about

978
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,879
with bama and puma

979
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,838
they tended to mostly be th cv they

980
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,640
tended to be

981
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,480
mostly type 1 and type 2. we're actually

982
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,759
currently growing a large population

983
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
that we intend to screen with the

984
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,680
molecular marker

985
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,519
to pull out the type three plants and we

986
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,759
hope that those type three plants

987
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,639
in that population that produces a lot

988
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,160
of varins

989
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:06,400
will produce a lot of cbdv so in theory

990
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,319
if this works and you can get high

991
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,599
variance we may be able to develop a

992
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,960
dual purpose

993
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,519
cbdv grain or fiber cultivar

994
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,639
as for cdc we're seeing some very

995
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,960
interesting

996
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,639
results especially in some of these high

997
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,480
cbd cultivars

998
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,799
we have one that produced up to two

999
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,119
percent cbc

1000
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,519
um we're currently working to understand

1001
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,400
the basis of that production

1002
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,320
um but at the moment we're not actively

1003
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,680
working to create any

1004
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,519
pure high cbc lines

1005
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,879
and just to follow on there are a couple

1006
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:44,159
more questions uh

1007
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,920
that i'll aim at you regarding

1008
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:50,879
cbg so maybe you could briefly describe

1009
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,920
the genetic systems uh george did touch

1010
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,200
on this

1011
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,800
uh of how we get a high cbg line

1012
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:02,639
and what would happen if that cbg line

1013
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:06,400
were segregating for example uh

1014
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,519
were heterozygous for an active thca

1015
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,800
synthase

1016
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,400
or was heterozygous for an active cbda

1017
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,440
synthase

1018
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,800
yeah i can answer that question so all

1019
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,039
cannabinoids start off as cbga

1020
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,000
so that's what it starts at and then if

1021
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,119
there's an active

1022
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,239
cbda or an active thca that

1023
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,559
enzyme converts the cdga to thca or cbda

1024
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,199
so in the absence of those enzymes you

1025
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,159
get a cbga dominant plant

1026
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,118
now if you have a plant that's

1027
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,440
heterozygous for a cbda synthase or a

1028
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,559
thca synthase

1029
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,960
that's something that we're looking at

1030
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,000
we're not 100 sure what the result will

1031
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,838
be

1032
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,920
it depends on the activity of this

1033
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,639
enzyme if there's a lot of that enzyme

1034
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,519
in this heterozygous case it's possible

1035
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,559
that we'll get

1036
00:39:53,519 --> 00:40:00,000
the same conversion from cbga

1037
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,920
to cbda or thca but it's also possible

1038
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,838
that in the heterozygous case

1039
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,079
the enzyme wouldn't be expressed at high

1040
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:10,078
enough levels to fully convert

1041
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,000
the cbga to cbda or thca

1042
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,680
and in that case we would expect to see

1043
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,079
an intermediate value

1044
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,719
we currently have a few f1s growing in

1045
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,079
the field

1046
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,318
between chemotype 3 and chemotype 4

1047
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,200
and we'll be testing those once they

1048
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,039
start to flower

1049
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,639
but at the moment we don't have any hard

1050
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,239
data

1051
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,559
so there's probably going to be some

1052
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,919
variation there is a significant amount

1053
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,599
of variation

1054
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,599
in um cbda synthase enzymes

1055
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,960
we would expect some to be more active

1056
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,760
than others

1057
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,318
so uh in short it probably varies and

1058
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,000
we're working to figure that out

1059
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,000
great yeah we should again qualify that

1060
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,719
much of the results that were presented

1061
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,880
today are mid-season results we have not

1062
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,439
analyzed any of the cannabinoids uh from

1063
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,800
the 12 cvg lines that were

1064
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,400
uh that we have in trials so stay tuned

1065
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,640
uh i'm going to point to jamie there's

1066
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,160
an excellent question about

1067
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:11,598
pollination and how do we maintain these

1068
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,799
uh feminized cbd trials at the same time

1069
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,680
we're also doing

1070
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,680
uh grain and fiber trials so jamie you

1071
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:21,838
touched on that in the chat box but

1072
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,838
let's elaborate on that

1073
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:28,799
okay so um here in in ithaca

1074
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,639
our our terrain is very

1075
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,960
full of hills and gorges and

1076
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,759
and you know very different landscapes

1077
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,838
that way

1078
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,880
and so we by mileage we keep all of our

1079
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,920
trials at least

1080
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,280
one mile apart but then in addition to

1081
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,119
that they're definitely

1082
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,800
separated by lots of landscape features

1083
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,838
so our cbd and essential oil trials are

1084
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,880
on an area

1085
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,559
that's pretty much surrounded by by

1086
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,358
forested areas to

1087
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,078
sort of as an additional barrier to try

1088
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:06,559
and keep

1089
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,560
the pollen out of those areas

1090
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,719
and there's another set of questions in

1091
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,919
there about

1092
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,838
irrigation so did we irrigate through

1093
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,039
the drought

1094
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:21,759
and how was fertilization done so this

1095
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,719
is one of the major differences between

1096
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,720
our current cbd cultivation practices

1097
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,598
which are based on plastic culture

1098
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,399
and drip irrigation versus the broad

1099
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,280
acre

1100
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,639
uh grain and fiber cultivation so you

1101
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,240
want to talk about that a little bit

1102
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,118
jamie

1103
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,318
sure so none of our fiber and grain

1104
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
trials

1105
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:47,679
were irrigated we

1106
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,000
did our very best guess on when to plant

1107
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,679
based on the weather forecast and what

1108
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,199
we could see

1109
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:57,358
but we did not because i have to be

1110
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,960
separated by so far

1111
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,400
by such a great distance a lot of the

1112
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,159
areas where we would plant our grain and

1113
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,440
fiber trials are not necessarily in

1114
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,559
spots where we even could

1115
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,519
irrigate if we wanted to um

1116
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,599
so the grain trials are all the fields

1117
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:17,519
are fertilized before

1118
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,440
we plant with um i believe this year we

1119
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,199
used 2299

1120
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,599
it was our fertilizer so it was

1121
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,719
broadcast on the fields

1122
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,640
at a rate about 75 pounds of nitrogen

1123
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:32,239
per acre

1124
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,400
and then at at about

1125
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,318
a month into the planting the fiber

1126
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,318
trials and the grain trials were given

1127
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,719
an additional

1128
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:43,519
70 pounds of nitrogen per acre as

1129
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:47,118
ammonium sulfate

1130
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,559
the cbd trials i mean uh

1131
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,800
craig is there he could probably talk

1132
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,440
more about those those were all through

1133
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,480
the

1134
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,079
drip irrigation

1135
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,480
yep so we've been injecting a

1136
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:03,359
water-soluble fertilizer

1137
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:07,199
we did include granular fertilizer as we

1138
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,719
laid the beds uh at about 90 pounds of

1139
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,759
nitrogen to the acre

1140
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:16,559
and then we have supplemented that with

1141
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,240
soluble uh 12-5-16 fertilizer

1142
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,639
through the drip line we've done that

1143
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,679
twice in our cbd trials

1144
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:27,358
at this point most of those cbd plants

1145
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,279
are in flower or very close to flower

1146
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,199
so we will not add any additional

1147
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,200
fertilizer at this point

1148
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,399
uh although there's a lot of research

1149
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,439
that needs to be done

1150
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,200
to clarify a best practice here

1151
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,559
an optimum management practice but

1152
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:47,118
our plants are quite large right now and

1153
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,719
encouraging additional vegetative growth

1154
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,838
uh may not be beneficial

1155
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:53,519
overall at this point so many other good

1156
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,440
questions in here and we're going to do

1157
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,480
our best to answer them

1158
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,358
uh if we can't answer them uh in this

1159
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,599
q a session by all means follow up with

1160
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:03,838
us

1161
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,039
afterwards or follow up with your local

1162
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:09,920
cornell cooperative extension specialist

1163
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,639
there's a question about why sending the

1164
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,400
chinese

1165
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:16,239
fiber plants to florida was there not

1166
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,559
supplemental lighting in the greenhouse

1167
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,199
what's going on here jacob do you want

1168
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,759
to

1169
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,480
answer that question about uh critical

1170
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,040
day length

1171
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,679
of chinese these chinese varieties

1172
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,719
versus

1173
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,919
other grain and fiber types for example

1174
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,239
so there's a lot that we don't know

1175
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,519
about these plants um

1176
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,199
we've run some uh gbs on them and uh

1177
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,559
craig has some interesting data about

1178
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,960
them and

1179
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:41,759
they tend to be quite genetically

1180
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,358
distinct

1181
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,440
and quite genetically distinct

1182
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:49,039
especially from other grain and

1183
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,358
fiber types uh so what we think is going

1184
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,079
on

1185
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,719
is that it requires a very short day

1186
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,318
length

1187
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,318
we don't know what that critical photo

1188
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,559
period is for a lot of our

1189
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,318
full season cbd varieties once the day

1190
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,199
length gets below about

1191
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,039
14 hours we start seeing flowering for

1192
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,559
these plants it might be considerably

1193
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,000
lower it might be

1194
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,400
13 hours we don't know but in florida

1195
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,039
which

1196
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,000
is a lot closer to the equator we're

1197
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,039
expecting the day

1198
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,639
length to be shorter um

1199
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,400
and in florida they've the east

1200
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,199
collaborator has also been testing

1201
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,400
these lines and uh they flowered late in

1202
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,159
florida

1203
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,480
but they flowered and they were able to

1204
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,159
harvest seed in our trials

1205
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,760
we didn't push it to the last possible

1206
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,920
second um but

1207
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,440
we were not able to harvest seed from

1208
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,800
these varieties

1209
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,920
um and we think it's due to a very

1210
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,079
short photo period uh

1211
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,119
requirement for these plants to flower

1212
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,400
um

1213
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,119
so in the greenhouse

1214
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,680
uh the plants were mature around march

1215
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,880
or so

1216
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:57,039
and at that point uh some of the plants

1217
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,519
were just starting to flower

1218
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,119
but we don't have a shade curtain and

1219
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,639
the daylights were starting to get too

1220
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,920
long at that point

1221
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,159
and then the plants that were starting

1222
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,519
to flower ceased flowering went back to

1223
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,239
vegetative

1224
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:12,318
so ultimately if we had a shade curtain

1225
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,598
and could block out the sun

1226
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:15,679
we might have been able to get them to

1227
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,920
flower but we don't have that facility

1228
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,919
yet

1229
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,479
yep so the problem was actually not

1230
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,679
supplemental lighting

1231
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,280
but our lack of ability to

1232
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,639
uh deprive the plants to shade the

1233
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,200
plants

1234
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,719
and keep them dark so we're very much

1235
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,318
looking forward to having that light

1236
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,959
deprivation shading

1237
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,400
so that we can control flowering all 12

1238
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,119
months of the year

1239
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,000
even when the days are get too long

1240
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,519
which is in

1241
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,039
march and april uh

1242
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,039
some other questions there's a good

1243
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,719
question from paul about whether

1244
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,400
molecular breeding can be used for pest

1245
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,838
and disease resistance

1246
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,880
uh that is a great lead-in to our next

1247
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:04,078
talks uh in the next session

1248
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,480
uh starting at 10 o'clock

1249
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,160
where chris and ali will talk about uh

1250
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,800
some of our work

1251
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,318
on powdery mildew resistance so yes we

1252
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,200
are confident that

1253
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,920
we will be able to develop molecular

1254
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,399
markers

1255
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:24,720
for at least for some disease resistance

1256
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,880
uh other questions or questions about

1257
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,919
uh recommendations for the best

1258
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,519
cultivars

1259
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,000
uh for dual purpose and uh

1260
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,838
let me also get back to a question about

1261
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,199
a dual purpose

1262
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:42,639
fiber and cbd cultivars so

1263
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:44,639
we have posted our grain and fiber trial

1264
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:45,679
results on our website so please look

1265
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,879
those over

1266
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,039
i will say there is variability in

1267
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,079
the quality of seed lots from year to

1268
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,079
year still

1269
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,359
that is still a major issue in the

1270
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,000
industry

1271
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,639
is the ability to get reliably high

1272
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
quality

1273
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:06,400
seed from year to year finding

1274
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,440
a local seed source helps with that so

1275
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,318
we have had very good relationship

1276
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,358
with uni seeds just across the border in

1277
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,480
ontario

1278
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:18,639
in providing us high quality seed

1279
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,039
but please please look over those

1280
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,078
results

1281
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:26,800
and recognize that they are still only

1282
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,680
on a relatively small number of sites

1283
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,440
and soil types in new york state i'll

1284
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,719
just say in general that

1285
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:38,400
hemp demands the highest quality soils

1286
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:41,598
you have in your farm it requires a deep

1287
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,760
rich loam that is well drained so

1288
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,760
don't believe the height that hemp can

1289
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,960
grow on marginal soils

1290
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,400
or as one of my good friends and

1291
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,318
colleagues said

1292
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,760
you can grow it on marginal soil and

1293
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,759
you'll get marginal yield

1294
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,599
so it's a good question about producing

1295
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,720
cbd

1296
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:06,400
and fiber uh so the cbd

1297
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:09,838
is produced in the female flowers and

1298
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,599
to get the optimum fiber long quali uh

1299
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,759
high quality long fiber you need to

1300
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,680
harvest relatively early right at the

1301
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,720
start of flowering

1302
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,199
but there may well be enough cbd

1303
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,480
produced in those flowers at that point

1304
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,558
in the development

1305
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,519
that you can get a reasonable yield of

1306
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,920
cbd

1307
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:28,880
as well as your yield of high quality

1308
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,240
fiber

1309
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,599
and hemp flax has produced

1310
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,039
a harvester that has a flower harvesting

1311
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,599
combine head that can

1312
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,239
rise quite high and chop those flower

1313
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,240
heads

1314
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,598
and at the same time be chopping the

1315
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,639
fiber

1316
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,200
so we look forward to the

1317
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,960
industry continue continuing to expand

1318
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,358
and develop that machinery

1319
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,639
so that we can potentially do a dual

1320
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:58,318
purpose

1321
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,318
uh cbd and fiber harvest and i'll just

1322
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:01,519
answer one more question in here that i

1323
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,159
noticed

1324
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,719
what about going to a broad acre

1325
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,318
cultivation for cbd

1326
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:09,838
that's definitely a trend that we're

1327
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:13,440
seeing in the industry

1328
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:15,279
we're seeing in colorado uh center pivot

1329
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,280
irrigation and broad acre

1330
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,480
planting uh for cbd we actually have

1331
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,599
two trials uh planted this year uh

1332
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,440
direct seeded

1333
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:29,680
uh cbd trials one at very high density

1334
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,119
similar to our grain and fiber trials

1335
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,159
and the other a little bit lower

1336
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,358
planted on 30 inch spacing that we

1337
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,399
thinned down to

1338
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:42,639
12 or 18 inches between plants

1339
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,400
so we have a flower combine header

1340
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,039
on order it should come in in a couple

1341
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,838
of weeks and that's what we look forward

1342
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,079
to

1343
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,199
researching next year the end of this

1344
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,559
year and next year

1345
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:57,439
is focusing more on broad acre

1346
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,160
plantings and combine harvesting of

1347
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,200
flower heads for cbd

1348
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,679
so i am going to pause right here and we

1349
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,639
have a five-minute break

1350
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,879
so continue to ask your questions in the

1351
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,318
chat box so the panelists can respond to

1352
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,240
that

1353
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,358
and we will be back and start our

1354
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:19,838
program again

1355
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,838
at 10 o'clock thank you everyone

1356
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,480
okay welcome back everyone uh it's ten

1357
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:30,719
o'clock

1358
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,719
and we're going to resume our program

1359
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,159
next on our program well we're starting

1360
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,199
our second session

1361
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,118
on hemp crop management uh

1362
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,960
with some of our pathologists and

1363
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,000
entomologists and weed scientists in

1364
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,720
this group

1365
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,159
starting with a live presentation from

1366
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,838
graduate student

1367
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:52,558
ali khaled in the field with chris smart

1368
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:54,159
so chris you're muted you can go ahead

1369
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,519
and unmute

1370
00:52:54,159 --> 00:53:01,519
and we will start the presentation

1371
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:03,679
okay hi um like larry said my name's ali

1372
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,960
ali kayla i'm a graduate student in

1373
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,519
chris smart's lab

1374
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,440
who is out here with me um of course

1375
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:12,159
we're staying six feet apart

1376
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,159
and also out here is um another lab

1377
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:17,598
member of ours collin day

1378
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:20,639
um so sorry in advance if we uh

1379
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,359
disconnect we're we're gonna do our best

1380
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,879
but

1381
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,639
um i just wanted to talk a little bit

1382
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,920
about some of my research

1383
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,400
so i'm looking mostly at a pathogen

1384
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,838
called

1385
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,559
powdery mildew which we have out here

1386
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,599
in the field that we wanted to show you

1387
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,920
and

1388
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,400
we are working with larry's lab to do

1389
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,079
some um

1390
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,240
looking for resistance for powdery

1391
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,318
mildew but i wanted to talk a little bit

1392
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:49,039
about a different project today

1393
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,480
um about how pottery mildew can affect

1394
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:55,358
secondary metabolites

1395
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,280
in hemp so we all know about

1396
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,558
some secondary metabolites like

1397
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,000
cannabinoids like

1398
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,839
which include cbd and cpg

1399
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,760
but there's another class of secondary

1400
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,799
metabolites that hemp

1401
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,319
produces a lot of which are terpenes

1402
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,440
and terpenes are a volatile or volatile

1403
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,838
compounds that are

1404
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,119
also produced by the flower and are

1405
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:21,440
responsible for

1406
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:24,480
the um fragrance and flavor of

1407
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,760
the hemp flowers so

1408
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,880
we have um three

1409
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,880
major questions that we're trying to

1410
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,079
address with this project

1411
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,838
the first being how can how do the

1412
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,400
terpene

1413
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:43,119
profiles in hemp change throughout

1414
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,079
the season and how does flowering time

1415
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,880
affect

1416
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,920
those terpene profiles and so for that

1417
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,358
project

1418
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,400
we are collecting terpene samples weekly

1419
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,598
throughout the season

1420
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,639
from same plants

1421
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:02,079
and so our second question is how do

1422
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:05,598
how does a biological fungicide

1423
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:09,359
affect the terpene profiles

1424
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:12,640
and for that project we have

1425
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:16,239
been treating some plants with a

1426
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,480
bacillus based biological fungicide

1427
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,959
according to the label rate and we've

1428
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,159
taken samples from

1429
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,679
a from plants that were treated and

1430
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,239
plants that were untreated

1431
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,679
and i recently inoculated those plants

1432
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:32,719
with powdery mildew

1433
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,399
and once infection is established we'll

1434
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,239
take another collection from those

1435
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,599
plants and we'll be able to see

1436
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:43,118
how those compare and then the third

1437
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,280
question is more relating to

1438
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,720
the pathogens themselves and how the

1439
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,599
pathogens

1440
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,598
can affect terpene profiles as well as

1441
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,680
cannabinoid profiles

1442
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,920
um and for that one we're adding in a

1443
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,960
second pathogen botrytis gray mold

1444
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,318
so we will have plants inoculated with

1445
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,159
powdery mildew

1446
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,440
plants inoculated with botrytis and

1447
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,159
healthy plants

1448
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,358
and we'll take terpene samples from all

1449
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,159
three of those

1450
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,679
types of plants and see how the terpene

1451
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,358
levels differ

1452
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:17,358
um and for the that um for that project

1453
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,639
as well at the end of the season we will

1454
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:23,598
also take um flower samples so that we

1455
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:26,719
can look at cannabinoid profiles as well

1456
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,200
so for collecting terpenes it's a little

1457
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,439
bit

1458
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,879
um more challenging and we have to get a

1459
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,519
little bit more creative since those

1460
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,160
compounds

1461
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,679
are volatiles so we have kind of an

1462
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,679
interesting setup for

1463
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:40,558
our collections that we kind of wanted

1464
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:44,159
to talk about and show you today

1465
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:47,599
so we have our setup here and we use

1466
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:50,159
these turkey bags they're just

1467
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,440
these plastic bags that you people use

1468
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,480
to cook turkeys

1469
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,760
in so we i actually have to bake these

1470
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,358
so that we don't have to

1471
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,599
um have any interference with chemicals

1472
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:05,039
from the bags and what we're collecting

1473
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,798
and we take these bags and we just

1474
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,558
secure them around a part of the plant

1475
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,159
that we want to collect usually a part

1476
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,400
that has flowers

1477
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,358
we secure it at the base with some zip

1478
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,280
ties to make it

1479
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:20,000
um nice and secure and then

1480
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,839
from there we cut two holes in the bag

1481
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,199
one so we have air flow in

1482
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:28,400
and one so we have airflow out for the

1483
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:31,519
hole that is the airflow in we secure

1484
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,079
a filter so that the air coming in isn't

1485
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:37,280
going to contaminate our sample

1486
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,318
and then for the airflow out we have

1487
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,359
um it's connected to some tubing which

1488
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,599
is then

1489
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:47,119
connected to a collection tube which has

1490
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,160
a filter inside

1491
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,798
that the compounds can stick to

1492
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:53,440
then the collection tube is connected to

1493
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,559
a pump

1494
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,119
which provides the airflow and all of

1495
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,480
this

1496
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,920
equipment is provided to us by

1497
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,400
dennis willett's lab who we're

1498
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,760
collaborating with on this project

1499
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,400
and once we have our

1500
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,240
collection on this tube it goes directly

1501
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,519
onto a machine called a gas

1502
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:19,358
uh spec gas spectrometer and mess

1503
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:23,599
guess chromatomatographs

1504
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:26,078
sorry and mass spectrometer um

1505
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,599
and that machine can allow us to see

1506
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,359
what compounds are there

1507
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,200
and at what levels they're there so we

1508
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:34,798
can determine

1509
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,960
a secondary metabolite profile for all

1510
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:40,559
of our samples and

1511
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:44,079
the gcms is also provided by

1512
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,240
the dennis willett lab who is working

1513
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,599
with us on this project and they're

1514
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:52,558
kindly letting us use

1515
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,559
all of this equipment um so

1516
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,159
that is what i've got for my secondary

1517
00:58:55,838 --> 00:59:01,358
metabolite project

1518
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,519
oh yes and um we have some more

1519
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:05,598
powdery on this plant that's part of the

1520
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:07,679
reason we're out in this

1521
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,798
trial we have some nice examples of

1522
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,199
powdery

1523
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,199
out here

1524
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,960
so um i'm looking forward to answering

1525
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,838
any questions later during the

1526
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,838
q a session

1527
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:26,239
uh back back to larry okay

1528
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,920
that's great thank you thanks very much

1529
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:32,000
uh that worked great

1530
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:35,519
uh and uh folks can definitely see

1531
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,559
that uh we have our share of powdery

1532
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:40,400
mildew

1533
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:43,519
in our trials uh and i'm going to shift

1534
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:47,039
now to start presentation from jen starr

1535
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:49,440
in gary bergstrom's lab and she will

1536
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,679
give you some excellent descriptions of

1537
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:55,200
other diseases

1538
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,519
uh we have had in him

1539
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,879
hello and welcome to the 2020 virtual

1540
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:02,079
cornell hemp research

1541
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,240
team field day my name is jennifer starr

1542
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,480
and i am the research support specialist

1543
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:08,558
for dr gary bergstrom's field crops

1544
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,880
pathology laboratory

1545
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,880
i also work alongside kevin myers who

1546
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,400
helps with scouting for hemp disease and

1547
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,400
does our molecular testing

1548
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,280
today i'll be giving a brief overview of

1549
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,159
foliar diseases and possible

1550
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,559
management strategies i want to focus

1551
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:28,719
this talk on just a few things

1552
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,920
to highlight i will start with septoria

1553
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,558
leaf spot

1554
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,639
and bi polaris leaf spot also known as

1555
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,559
hemp leaf spot

1556
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,078
then i will move to lesser impact

1557
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:43,839
emerging leaf diseases

1558
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,839
such as downy mildew and hemp rust

1559
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,039
septorial leaf spot is caused by the

1560
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:51,358
fungus septoria species

1561
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,039
and symptoms begin on the lower leaves

1562
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,759
of the plant

1563
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,199
as irregularly shaped spots with yellow

1564
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,079
margins

1565
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:02,000
these spots expand over time turn brown

1566
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,280
and the yellow margins brought in to

1567
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,280
look something like this

1568
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,679
this was observed in eastern new york in

1569
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:12,318
2019

1570
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:15,199
and in eastern and western new york in

1571
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:18,159
2020

1572
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:21,838
in this slide i have a video of what

1573
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,838
septorial leaf spot looks like in the

1574
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:27,838
fields

1575
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,760
and as you can see it is on the lower

1576
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,199
level

1577
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:39,440
spots with the bigger yellow margins

1578
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:41,598
this is septoria leaf spot

1579
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,200
the next highlight is bipolaris leaf

1580
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,440
spot also known as hemp leaf spot

1581
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:50,239
this is caused by a fungus that's being

1582
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,519
classified as bipolaris gigantia

1583
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:56,959
related to dreschlera gigantea

1584
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,880
symptoms start as round specs and spots

1585
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,159
that coalesce over time

1586
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,880
and sometimes they have a dark margin

1587
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,078
here with lighter tan interiors or

1588
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,519
sometimes don't have

1589
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,318
any margin at all we have noticed this

1590
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,440
leaf spot disease since cornell's hemp

1591
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:16,239
team

1592
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,760
started the program a few years back and

1593
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,519
we usually notice this

1594
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,480
at the end of the growing season and

1595
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:25,759
we've noticed throughout new york state

1596
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:28,639
this is not a super high impact

1597
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,880
disease as other states have seen it

1598
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:31,358
defoliate plants we have not seen that

1599
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,838
yet

1600
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:35,838
in new york state

1601
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:44,480
next up we have downy mildew

1602
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:47,838
lesser impact emerging disease

1603
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,318
this is caused by pseudopornosphera

1604
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,599
which has just been recently id'd by

1605
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:55,599
sequencing

1606
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,318
last week the spots start out as these

1607
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,280
light green

1608
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:01,440
yellow spots with necrotic margins and

1609
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,680
the lower surface of the leaf you can

1610
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,798
actually see the fungus growing in humid

1611
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,078
conditions

1612
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:09,199
or if you catch it in the morning time

1613
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,318
when the dew is still

1614
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:15,118
on the plant later on

1615
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,079
the lesions become a little more angular

1616
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,760
and are defined

1617
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,920
by the leaf veins of the hemp plant

1618
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,440
this was just recently observed in

1619
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,559
ithaca last week

1620
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,960
so in 2020

1621
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,480
and in the next slide i have a video of

1622
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,039
what it looks like on

1623
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,039
the plant

1624
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,639
and this is a good example of how

1625
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,838
the veins of the leaf are demarcating

1626
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:45,838
the spot

1627
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:55,760
and confining it as you see here

1628
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,759
this is downy mildew on hemp

1629
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,960
our last feature is hemp rust

1630
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:05,838
and hemp rust has been morphologically

1631
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,199
identified as urido cregariana

1632
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,639
and again this is something we're going

1633
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,159
to want to be looking on the lower

1634
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,558
surface of the leaf

1635
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:14,399
we have yellow to orange pustules or

1636
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:18,160
spots on the lower surface

1637
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:21,680
and on the upper surface we have these

1638
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:22,960
necrotic areas with very faint chlorosis

1639
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:26,000
around them

1640
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,000
and then sometimes rust disease systems

1641
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,039
have alternate hosts to complete their

1642
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,280
life cycle

1643
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,960
we have not found an alternate host with

1644
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,880
this hemp rust

1645
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,720
sometimes breast disease systems don't

1646
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,039
have alternate hosts

1647
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:42,159
we found this last year at the end of

1648
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:45,760
the growing season in october of 2019

1649
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:48,000
we will be looking again this year

1650
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,760
for this so we can try to study it

1651
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,719
further

1652
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,160
the following slide is a close-up of

1653
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:55,838
what the pustule looks like

1654
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,838
on the under surface of the leaf and

1655
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:02,400
what is inside that pustule

1656
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,400
these are uradiniospores of hemp rust

1657
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:12,719
we do see other hemp leaf spots

1658
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,719
i wanted to include a quick

1659
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,239
summary of those here

1660
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,159
we see crystal ariella zone 8 leaf spot

1661
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,000
we see a circular

1662
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:28,960
leaf spot we see some philium leaf spot

1663
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,119
and we also see a number of other

1664
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,280
diseases that are not leaf spots

1665
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,240
we see fusarium bud light which could

1666
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,440
have

1667
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:39,118
implications for quality of flowers and

1668
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,200
grain

1669
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:45,760
we see fusarium wilt we see white molds

1670
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:47,838
and we see botrytis gray mold so as you

1671
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,319
can see in addition to leaf spot

1672
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,159
diseases we do see

1673
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:55,119
and work on other diseases that are

1674
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:55,118
affecting hemp

1675
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,680
so possible product treatments we are

1676
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,720
directing

1677
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:05,838
growers to go to the dec

1678
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:08,480
new york dec web page if this address

1679
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:11,199
and go to pesticide product information

1680
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,199
hit search

1681
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:15,358
this will bring you to advanced search

1682
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:18,479
you want to click

1683
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,798
that press search which will then bring

1684
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,079
you

1685
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:25,358
to pesticide use you want to choose hemp

1686
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:28,400
industrial hit search that will bring up

1687
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:31,038
about 98 products most of which

1688
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,240
are biologic in nature some bacillus

1689
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,240
type products

1690
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,479
you want to check the labels on those to

1691
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,798
make sure hemp is included

1692
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,798
all of this information again is present

1693
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:44,798
on the cornell hemp webpage

1694
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:44,798
under the faq heading

1695
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:51,038
in addition to the dec web page we want

1696
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,440
to use best agronomic practices

1697
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,119
this will be second nature to seasoned

1698
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,679
growers and producers

1699
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,079
but we want to start with prevention

1700
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,358
with having reliable seed source and

1701
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,680
good soil health

1702
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,199
it is a myth that hemp can be produced

1703
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:08,078
on marginal soils

1704
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:10,078
we want fertile soil well-drained soil

1705
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,480
we want our plant spacing to be

1706
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,079
such where we're reducing the humidity

1707
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,119
between the plants

1708
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:20,240
because fungus really loves

1709
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,200
to be in humid places it encourages its

1710
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,358
growth

1711
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,480
sanitation very important we want to

1712
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:27,358
remove debris

1713
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,119
off site you may burn it you may compost

1714
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:32,159
it but we want it away from the hemp

1715
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:34,000
field weed control also very important

1716
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:35,199
we have noticed cercasper growing on

1717
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,559
weeds we have noticed

1718
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:40,879
downy mildew growing on weeds are those

1719
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:44,000
weeds vectors

1720
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,519
for fungal growth to the hemp or is it

1721
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,440
the other way around we are still

1722
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:49,119
investigating that

1723
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,880
but it's important to keep those weeds

1724
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,640
in control and out of the way

1725
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,920
crop rotation also something to note um

1726
01:07:54,639 --> 01:08:00,078
edible beans soy beans sunflowers

1727
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,200
and they're white molds probably not a

1728
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,318
great idea to

1729
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:07,038
follow hemp after those crops also

1730
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,838
in question recently corn and cereal

1731
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,000
crops

1732
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:14,558
producing mycotoxins will be wise to put

1733
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,479
hemp after those crops and then

1734
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,159
resistant cultivars

1735
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:21,838
something that our program here at

1736
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:21,838
cornell are working towards now

1737
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,079
if you have questions about your hemp

1738
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,719
crop

1739
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,559
and have problems and want some

1740
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,880
diagnostics

1741
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,719
it may be wise for you to contact your

1742
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,920
cornell cooperative extension

1743
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:38,719
educator if you don't know who yours is

1744
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,000
you may go

1745
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:46,399
to the cornell hemp page

1746
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,399
and find who your representative is

1747
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,480
if you would like to submit samples to

1748
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:55,439
my lab you may submit them through your

1749
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:58,399
cornell cooperative extension educator

1750
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,838
through them to us we may not give you

1751
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,719
the best turnaround time

1752
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:04,399
but it will be of no charge to you or if

1753
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,439
you're looking for some quick results

1754
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:07,838
you can use

1755
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,798
our plant disease diagnostic clinic at

1756
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:10,880
cornell

1757
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,679
and it is a fee for service it's

1758
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,440
relatively low cost i believe it's

1759
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,279
thirty to thirty five dollars if you're

1760
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,519
in state fifty dollars if you're out of

1761
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,759
state and i've left

1762
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,440
the contact information for you here

1763
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:27,279
again all of this information

1764
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:29,599
is on the cornell team web page

1765
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,440
i'm going to leave you with our lab's

1766
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,079
contact information

1767
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,559
this is dr gary bergstrom's email

1768

laboratory phone number

1771
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,919
if you have further questions after this

1772

enjoy the rest of

1775
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:50,158
cornell's virtual hemp talks today

1776
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,479
thanks very much jen we're a little bit

1777
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,238
ahead of schedule now

1778
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:57,839
uh we have a couple of minutes for

1779
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,799
questions

1780
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:03,440
uh so i do see a couple of questions in

1781
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,320
the chat box

1782
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,559
if jenn or gary are available and want

1783
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:12,960
to follow up on those questions one

1784
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:17,120
is are any of these products

1785
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:19,600
omri listed

1786
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,319
i'll just jump in this gary uh there are

1787
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,800
quite a few

1788
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:25,279
things lusted with uh fungicidal or

1789
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,360
insecticidal activity on the omri list

1790
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:30,800
and a lot of those are on the dec

1791
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:33,198
list the term suggested

1792
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,920
is is uh problematic because there's

1793
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:38,238
very there's very little uh test data

1794
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,600
uh supporting efficacy at this point and

1795
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,919
i know that uh

1796
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,760
that chris and her lab is looking at

1797
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,560
that in the context of mildew and

1798
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,880
whatnot

1799
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,840
we we've done some fairly rudimentary

1800
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,000
testing

1801
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,199
uh for some of the late season things

1802
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,760
but really there's not

1803
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:54,479
there's not a database there to uh to

1804
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,000
point to

1805
01:10:54,479 --> 01:11:01,198
so we have counseled growers uh to

1806
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,399
look at uh a few materials that have

1807
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:06,639
uh efficacy in other crop areas

1808
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,639
um so we have some insights that they

1809
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,719
might work and and to try to

1810
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,079
to do some treated strips and leave some

1811
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:14,640
non-treated to try to learn

1812
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:16,319
something here but uh recommendations

1813
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,679
are are a bit elusive

1814
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,920
at least for us in new york at this

1815
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,920
point

1816
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,239
there's another question specifically

1817
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,520
about uh

1818
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:30,158
bacillus fungicides uh cease or

1819
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,760
serenade i don't know if chris has

1820
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:34,960
included those in her

1821
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,679
trial i see chris is on uh or

1822
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,880
but but again the trial is underway we

1823
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,920
don't have results

1824
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,800
at this point as gary mentioned uh it's

1825
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:47,039
definitely an

1826
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:48,960
active area of research uh

1827
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,279
jan and gary one more question before we

1828
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,399
move on to marion's presentation uh from

1829
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,119
nicole

1830
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,839
de city cultivar differences in

1831
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,439
susceptibility to leaf spots

1832
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,039
great question to call and i know you're

1833
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:04,960
interested in this as well and

1834
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:06,560
and uh the answer is hopeful yes we

1835
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,319
whether they're repeatable differences

1836
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,280
that's what we want to know

1837
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:12,719
we have particular opportunity uh in the

1838
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,559
cultivar trials out

1839
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:20,079
out this year uh to try to discriminate

1840
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,960
uh varieties in the cultivars in the

1841
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:24,399
sense of

1842
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,480
downy mildew for sure and and also uh

1843
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:29,359
i i think with the helmet the sport with

1844
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:31,519
the uh by polaris hemp leaf spot as well

1845
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:32,639
but yeah that's a goal and we're not

1846
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,320
there yet uh

1847
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,679
perhaps in kentucky you got a better

1848
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,719
read on some of that

1849
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,158
thanks yep thanks very much gary and jen

1850
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,158
great presentation

1851
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:44,719
we are going to move on i'm going to

1852
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:46,479
start uh marion zuffle's presentation

1853
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,719
from new york state ipm

1854
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:49,599
i will just give you a heads up the

1855
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,039
audio

1856
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:56,000
is uh the audio levels on this video

1857
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:57,840
are pretty low uh so you may need to

1858
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,679
turn up your volume a bit

1859
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,520
uh once it gets started here

1860
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,039
good morning my name is marion zuffali

1861
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,280
and i work for the new york state

1862
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,039
integrated pest management program

1863
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:11,198
today i'm going to talk to you about

1864
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:11,760
insect pests or potential insect pests

1865
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,319
of hemp

1866
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,760
and their management this was my first

1867
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:17,119
summer working in hemp and i've really

1868
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,760
enjoyed the experience

1869
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,399
so my goal this summer was to just go

1870
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,119
out there

1871
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:25,679
and learn as much as i can about hemp

1872
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:26,559
try to identify any insects and diseases

1873
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,158
that are out there

1874
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,520
so today i'm going to specifically just

1875
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,359
talk about the insect pests we've

1876
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,159
already heard about some of the diseases

1877
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:33,679
out there

1878
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,639
so i'm just going to focus in on what

1879
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,640
insects i found

1880
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,279
before i get started i first just wanted

1881
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,880
to stress the importance of scouting and

1882
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,639
identification because not everything

1883
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,400
that's out there is a pest

1884
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,719
in fact very few insects to date have

1885
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:51,279
caused enough damage to impact hemp

1886
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,960
and this crop is still relatively new so

1887
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:55,198
we don't have a lot of thresholds for

1888
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,719
any insect pests that we do find

1889
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,479
so for this reason it's very important

1890
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,600
for you to go out scout your hemp fields

1891
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,119
regularly

1892
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,800
and that way you can notice any

1893
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:03,359
potential problems and keep an eye on

1894
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,600
them

1895
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,799
so what i did this summer was i scouted

1896
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,199
nine different hemp fields

1897
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,360
weekly as well as one high tunnel and i

1898
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,799
also set up uh european corn borer

1899
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:13,679
tracks which you can see here in the

1900
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,440
picture

1901
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,199
next to hempfield so i can monitor the

1902
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:18,399
flight of european corn borer which is

1903
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:21,119
one of the known pests

1904
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:22,399
potential pests of hemp again not

1905
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:23,439
everything is a pest so we have to be

1906
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:25,439
able to identify

1907
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:27,279
what's a pest what's a beneficial and

1908
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:28,879
what's an incidental an insect is

1909
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:31,359
that just happens to be out in the field

1910
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,719
but isn't causing any damage

1911
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,039
okay so now i'm going to go over some of

1912
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:37,198
the insects that i did find this season

1913
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,640
the first one that i encountered was

1914
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,238
early in the season while the plants

1915
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,159
were still in the greenhouse

1916
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:43,359
the grower came to me and he informed me

1917
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:43,920
that hundreds of the seedlings were

1918
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:45,759
dying

1919
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,199
and you can see that from the top um

1920
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,880
upper right hand corner

1921
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,399
the seedlings were turning yellow and

1922
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,279
were dying and he wasn't quite sure what

1923
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:52,879
was causing it

1924
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,519
and we noticed that he had a lot of

1925
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,039
fungus gnats and he also had fusarium

1926
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,640
and we determined that it was fucerum we

1927
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,719
took some seedlings and sent them to

1928
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,480
chris smart and she identified fusarium

1929
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,399
in the seedlings

1930
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:06,399
so the fungus gnats they are tiny little

1931
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,639
flies that lay their eggs

1932
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:09,599
in wet soil near the base of the plants

1933
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,880
the larvae will

1934
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,560
hatch out of the eggs and then they

1935
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,480
start feeding on decaying matter but

1936
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,640
they will also feed on roots

1937
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,639
and both the adult fungus gnats as well

1938
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,760
as the larvae can transmit diseases such

1939
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,520
as fusarium

1940
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,440
so what the grower did is he changed out

1941
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,120
his potting media and then he also

1942
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:26,719
decreased his watering he was

1943
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:28,238
over watering his plants and you're

1944
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,399
supposed to really let them dry out

1945
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,000
between waterings let the top layer dry

1946
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:34,479
out between waterings

1947
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,039
and that really helped his um fungus net

1948
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:37,759
problem

1949
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,279
and he also introduced nematodes so one

1950
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,640
thing you can do to monitor for fungus

1951
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,238
gnats is you can place yellow sticky

1952
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,800
cards in your greenhouse

1953
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:46,238
so that you can detect them early if you

1954
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,320
do have fungus gnats

1955
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,079
you should allow this top layer of soil

1956
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,279
to dry out completely this will

1957
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,039
kill both the fungus as well as which

1958
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:57,119
the nets feed on as well as the fungus

1959
01:15:55,039 --> 01:16:00,158
net larvae so really let that soil dry

1960
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,158
out between waterings

1961
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:07,039
this is the two spotted spider mite

1962
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,800
these are small little mites found on

1963
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,158
the underside of leaves and they cause

1964
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,600
this stippling appearance that you can

1965
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:12,960
see in both of the pictures kind of on

1966
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,719
the upper surface of the leaves you

1967
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,000
usually notice the stippling first and

1968
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,640
then if you turn the leaf over you'll

1969
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,600
find the

1970
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,079
spider mites these i found in the high

1971
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,039
tunnel

1972
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:24,559
as well as in the field and both of them

1973
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:26,000
both in the high tunnel as well as

1974
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,600
in the field the numbers stayed fairly

1975
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,319
low the high tunnel has since been

1976
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,880
harvested

1977
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:32,719
and no control measures were needed and

1978
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,440
the populations in the field have never

1979
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,119
increased i

1980
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:36,639
monitor it weekly and the numbers have

1981
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:38,719
stayed very very low

1982
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,079
two spotted spider mites do prefer very

1983
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,760
hot dry weather

1984
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:43,279
so one of the ways to manage for them is

1985
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,719
to make sure that your plants aren't

1986
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:46,639
water stressed

1987
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:49,039
you can also remove any potential weed

1988
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,280
hosts that are surrounding your field

1989
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,119
and then if you do have a spider mite

1990
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,719
problem or you know that you will

1991
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,559
you can release predatory mites to

1992
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,319
control the spread of my population

1993
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,760
but if you do do this you have to do it

1994
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,079
in advance of

1995
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,239
the spider mites becoming out of control

1996
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,238
so as soon as you have that first sign

1997
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:09,519
of two spotted spider mites you want to

1998
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:11,198
release your beneficial predatory mites

1999
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,719
this is the red-headed flea beetle which

2000
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:14,238
was probably the most numerous insect

2001
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,239
that i observed this summer

2002
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:17,919
the adults are fairly large three to six

2003
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:20,238
millimeters and have a reddish brown

2004
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,239
head and a shiny black body

2005
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,000
they feed on the leaves between the

2006
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,479
between the veins and

2007
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,158
cause these holes all over the leaves

2008
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:29,839
even though they were very numerous and

2009
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:31,039
i saw quite a bit of damage all the

2010
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,800
plants grow out of it

2011
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,479
and the young seedlings are the ones

2012
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,360
that are most at risk from flea beetle

2013
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,439
damage

2014
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,039
so some of the control measures you can

2015
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:40,559
do is you can protect your young

2016
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,079
seedlings with row cover until they're

2017
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,440
large enough to withstand the feeding

2018
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,079
pressure

2019
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,919
you can also plow in the to decrease the

2020
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,039
overwintering population

2021
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,039
and then you can use beneficial

2022
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:53,679
nematodes which will control the larvae

2023
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:53,679
in the soil

2024
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:59,519
i also found some aphids these are small

2025
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,039
sap sucking insects kind of pear-shaped

2026
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,560
they're found on the underside of the

2027
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,279
leaves but they can also be found near

2028
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,199
the stem

2029
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,319
or in the flowers there are several

2030
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:07,919
different species

2031
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,319
of aphids that are known to occur on

2032
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,158
hemp of the nine fields that i was

2033
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,439
scouting only one of them did i find

2034
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,559
aphids in and they remained on the lower

2035
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:18,079
leaves

2036
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,840
and there was a lot of beneficials

2037
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:20,479
including ladybugs and my new pirate

2038
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,000
bugs

2039
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:23,839
and lace wings that really kept the

2040
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,359
population under control

2041
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,960
they are still out there and i'm still

2042
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:28,639
monitoring them weekly

2043
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,079
to make sure the population doesn't get

2044
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,640
any bigger

2045
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,479
i did take a sample and i sent it to the

2046
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,920
cornell insect diagnostic lab

2047
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:37,519
for identification because i don't know

2048
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,840
what species it is

2049
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,840
but i only found the one in one field

2050
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:45,599
there are a few different insects that

2051
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,600
were born into the stem of hemp

2052
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,760
including the common stock bore which is

2053
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,440
pictured here as well as european corn

2054
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,400
borer and the hemp ore the only one that

2055
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:54,559
i found this

2056
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,759
season was the common stock for i've not

2057
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,520
found the other ones

2058
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,199
i did set up traps for european corn

2059
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,520
borer but the numbers were very very low

2060
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,919
and i never found any in the plant

2061
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,280
so here's a picture of a larvae inside a

2062
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,079
hemp stock

2063
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:10,079
they are brown with these long white

2064
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:12,640
lines that run the length of the body

2065
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,399
the female will lay her eggs in grasses

2066
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,079
and weeds kind of around the edge of a

2067
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:16,879
field and when they hatch the when the

2068
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:18,319
larvae hatch

2069
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,239
they will move into the field looking

2070
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:22,000
for a suitable plant to bore into

2071
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:23,759
so one of the management options is to

2072
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,920
control your weeds and grasses

2073
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,679
in the surrounding fields usually if you

2074
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,279
do have stock bore it's going to be

2075
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,880
on the edge of fields where you're going

2076
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,279
to find the damage

2077
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,960
another option is to plant your plants

2078
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:35,519
early so that they're large enough that

2079
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,840
when

2080
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,400
the larvae move in they can withstand

2081
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,159
some of that boring damage

2082
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:44,238
chemical control options are limited

2083
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:45,599
because once they're inside the stem

2084
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,158
they're protected from any kind of

2085
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,440
chemical control

2086
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:51,198
this is the last insect that i'm going

2087
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:52,238
to talk about the yellow woolly bear

2088
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:53,839
caterpillar

2089
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,079
this is a caterpillar that feeds on many

2090
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:58,480
different plants including hemp

2091
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,000
it's covered in yet dense yellow hairs

2092
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:01,759
over its entire body

2093
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,359
and this one i found in the high tunnel

2094
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,199
that i was scouting and usually it

2095
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:07,599
doesn't cause a problem the female lays

2096
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:09,759
about 50 eggs on a host plant

2097
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,719
and the caterpillars they feed together

2098
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,320
for a little while but then they

2099
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,239
disperse throughout the field

2100
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,079
and just cause a little bit of damage to

2101
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:17,839
individual plants

2102
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,600
but because this was in a high tunnel

2103
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,679
they were all concentrated in one

2104
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,679
area and they couldn't disperse it

2105
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,279
caused much more significant damage

2106
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,119
so when i was in their scouting i

2107
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,679
noticed a lot of the plants the lower

2108
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,679
third

2109
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,679
of the plant was completely defoliated

2110
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,440
so i notified the grower about that

2111
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,719
and what we ended up doing he just went

2112
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:36,319
in and hand-picked them all

2113
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,239
there's probably about a hundred or so

2114
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:40,079
in the high tunnel but he could control

2115
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:41,119
them since it wasn't a defined area he

2116
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:43,198
could just go in

2117
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,960
and hand pick them all to remove them

2118
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,638
and it didn't really cause any

2119
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,960
serious damage because we were able to

2120
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,719
get rid of them

2121
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,800
so here just real briefly is a list of

2122
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,639
some of the other insects that i found

2123
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,239
on him which includes the leaf miner

2124
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,239
which i'm attempting to rear out to

2125
01:20:56,238 --> 01:20:58,879
determine what kind of what species it

2126
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:02,000
is

2127
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,159
four line plant bug various caterpillars

2128
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,119
different grasshoppers brown marmorated

2129
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:07,599
stink bug

2130
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:09,279
leaf hoppers tree hoppers um the oblique

2131
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,159
banded leaf roller i was able to rear

2132
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:12,079
that out

2133
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:13,198
um and the tarnished plant bug so as you

2134
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:16,000
can see there's a lot of different

2135
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:17,678
insects that are found on hemp

2136
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,439
not all of them are pests so it's

2137
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,158
important to know what's a pest which

2138
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:21,599
just what's

2139
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:22,559
an incidental and of course as i

2140
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,159
mentioned before what are your

2141
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,000
beneficials so that you can

2142
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:27,359
just control the ones that you need to

2143
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
so if there's any questions

2144
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:30,960
i will take those now okay thank you

2145
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,719
marion

2146
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:37,039
uh marian is on so

2147
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,800
i see a couple of questions in the chat

2148
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:42,880
we have one minute here

2149
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,150
uh if you want to pick one out

2150
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,500
uh

2151
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:46,500
[Music]

2152
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,039
there's a question about uh how

2153
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:52,000
prevalent corn borers have been in

2154
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:55,119
cornfields

2155
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:59,279
in new york and uh will this corn borer

2156
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,279
population potentially impact hemp

2157
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:04,800
sorry you can hear me yep okay good um

2158
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,639
so european corn borer in general has

2159
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:10,000
been very low in the state

2160
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:14,400
for at least 10 15 years now

2161
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,319
after the introduction of bt pilcorn

2162
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:18,960
we do think it might start increasing

2163
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:20,639
there's more non-gmo field

2164
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,639
being grown so the european corn border

2165
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,639
population might increase

2166
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,880
what impact european corn borer is going

2167
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,359
to have on hemp i don't know we haven't

2168
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,199
i have

2169
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:30,559
personally not seen any corn borer on

2170
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:33,759
hemp um

2171
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,239
i think hemp it doesn't tend to lodge or

2172
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,000
break as easily as corn does so it might

2173
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:40,000
not if when the corn bore gets

2174
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,479
inside the hem plant it might not have

2175
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,679
as much of an impact on the hemp

2176
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:48,959
itself um but having not seen it i

2177
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:50,560
i couldn't say for sure and

2178
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,560
one maybe one other question here

2179
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,840
there's a question about

2180
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:58,880
uh beneficial control

2181
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:01,279
of two spotted spider mites predatory

2182
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:04,319
mites versus ladybugs do you have any uh

2183
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:05,599
data on that i don't have any data i

2184
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,279
know that

2185
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,639
i've worked with two spotted spider

2186
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:10,960
mites in other crops

2187
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,679
and the predatory mites do a great job

2188
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,840
i've

2189
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,880
never intentionally released ladybugs

2190
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,119
specifically for

2191
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,639
spider mite control more so for afic

2192
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:20,319
control so i don't know how well the

2193
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,639
ladybugs would do on

2194
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,399
spider mites specifically i i do know

2195
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,880
that predatory mites do well but i don't

2196
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:30,238
have any data on the ladybugs

2197
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,359
okay great thanks marianne uh we are

2198
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:35,359
going to move on

2199
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:40,479
uh to lynn sosnoski's talk here

2200
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:43,279
hello so let me get that cued up

2201
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,238
oh welcome to my talk about weeds and

2202
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,800
weed management

2203
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:48,000
and hemp my name is lynn sisnoski and

2204
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,639
i'm an assistant professor

2205
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,479
of weed biology ecology and management

2206
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:55,199
and specialty crops here at cornell

2207
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:55,198
university

2208
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,079
weeds in any cropping system compete

2209
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,760
with the crop for water

2210
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:03,439
nutrients and light and that can

2211
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,480
directly impact

2212
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:08,319
yield quantity and quality

2213
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,718
weeds that become established in crops

2214
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:12,880
can alter the microclimates around the

2215
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,158
plants which can then impact disease

2216
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,840
development

2217
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:17,198
and weeds can actually serve as

2218
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,520
alternate hosts for both

2219
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,039
pests and pathogens in car cropping

2220
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,760
systems

2221
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:26,158
vegetation that isn't controlled can

2222
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,119
reduce the final harvestability of the

2223
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:28,799
crop

2224
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:30,158
and the absence of any kind of

2225
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,279
vegetation control

2226
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:35,519
chemicals in the hemp crop itself may

2227
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:38,079
necessitate the use of multiple

2228
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,199
and integrated practices to suppress

2229
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:42,880
weeds that become established

2230
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,559
with respect to integrated weed

2231
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,719
management and hemp

2232
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,920
the first step should always be proper

2233
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,920
site selection

2234
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,480
and that means avoiding fields with

2235
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,000
perennials or extremely high weed

2236
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:55,919
densities

2237
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,079
if you're going to start clean make sure

2238
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,639
to try and stay clean

2239
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:01,279
always manage and harvest your cleanest

2240
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,319
fields

2241
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:06,800
first with respect to planting date

2242
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:07,840
you might be able to plant and get ahead

2243
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,719
of weeds

2244
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,000
for example if the field that you're

2245
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:15,760
planting into has a

2246
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,920
lot of summer emerging weed species

2247
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,360
choose an earlier planting date that

2248
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,520
allows your crop to get up

2249
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:22,559
and gives it some kind of competitive

2250
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,400
advantage

2251
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,159
against the vegetation it's going to be

2252
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:28,479
competing with

2253
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:31,039
using a stale seed bed technique where

2254
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,919
you stimulate the germination

2255
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,519
of weeds and then eliminate emerged

2256
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,239
ceilings both physically

2257
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,960
and chemically can be a really useful

2258
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:40,879
tool

2259
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,198
but understand that not all weeds are

2260
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,400
going to respond equally well

2261
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:49,119
species with non-dormant seeds might be

2262
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:53,439
better controlled under this strategy as

2263
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:53,439
opposed to species with dormant seeds

2264
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,639
make sure that you have the best

2265
01:25:55,439 --> 01:26:01,039
planting conditions that you can achieve

2266
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:02,400
for instance making sure you have a nice

2267
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,479
even seed bed

2268
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,879
so that you have good soil to seed

2269
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:09,198
contact for even germination

2270
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,560
which will improve the crops competitive

2271
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:12,158
ability

2272
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,480
make sure that you plant with

2273
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:17,679
appropriate densities to minimize that

2274
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:19,599
open space that weeds can then colonize

2275
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,079
if you're using transplants this can be

2276
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,560
a really useful strategy to give your

2277
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:26,000
crop a competitive size advantage over

2278
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,800
the weeds

2279
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,560
choosing varieties can have an influence

2280
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,600
on how competitive the crop

2281
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,199
is as well based on the heights and the

2282
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,639
branching traits that that

2283
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:40,559
varieties possesses if you're going to

2284
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,039
be cultivating make sure you keep your

2285
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,679
rows

2286
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:45,600
as straight as possible to maximize

2287
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,158
cultivation performance

2288
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,880
and get the weeds while they are small

2289
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:51,519
either at the white thread or the early

2290
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,039
seedling

2291
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,719
stages if you're using plastic mulch

2292
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,960
remember that this is still going to

2293
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:01,679
require weeding between beds

2294
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:04,560
and removing weeds that emerge through

2295
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,399
the planting holes

2296
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,880
so even though herbicides aren't

2297
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:09,279
available for use in hemp directly

2298
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,359
they're

2299
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:13,519
likely to be used in crops that are

2300
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,519
planted before him

2301
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,600
and we have to pay attention to this

2302
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,480
because these products have rotation

2303
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,520
restrictions

2304
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:24,718
on the label and hemp may not be

2305
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:28,159
explicitly listed but the term

2306
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,560
other crop often is and hemp is going to

2307
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:32,079
fall

2308
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,239
into that other crop category

2309
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:36,639
so if you're interested in understanding

2310
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:40,000
the type of plant back restrictions that

2311
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:42,159
might be encountered in industrial hemp

2312
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,479
production i suggest doing a google

2313
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:47,198
search for the terms wisconsin

2314
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:48,879
hemp and rotation restrictions and

2315
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:51,039
you're really likely to find

2316
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,800
this nice handout that was produced by

2317
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:55,119
uw madison

2318
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,400
which explicitly looks at the

2319
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:58,800
restrictions

2320
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:00,238
that are associated with the herbicides

2321
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,840
that are used in

2322
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:03,839
pre-seeding crops

2323
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,639
these are some of the rotation

2324
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:08,799
restrictions that my colleagues at

2325
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:11,199
uw-madison

2326
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,960
found across multiple herbicide labels

2327
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:15,678
and you can see they're extremely

2328
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,439
varied in the amount of time that you

2329
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,399
need to wait before you can plant

2330
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:22,719
industrial hemp for example for the

2331
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:25,439
fuselage and select max labels there was

2332
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:27,840
a one-month rotation restriction

2333
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:28,719
for something like pursuit in miss

2334
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,800
appear

2335
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:32,158
there was a 40-month rotation

2336
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,119
restriction

2337
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,719
now understand the list is not inclusive

2338
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:39,119
and labels can and do

2339
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,119
change and it is your responsibility to

2340
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,760
always consult the labels

2341
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:45,679
before making any herbicide application

2342
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:50,159
and before planting crops

2343
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:52,239
following herbicide applications

2344
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,238
just because we don't have herbicides

2345
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:56,238
currently labeled for use in hemp

2346
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,079
doesn't mean that we aren't looking to

2347
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:00,799
see how herbicides

2348
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,238
affect him we have a lot of herbicide

2349
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,560
trials that are currently

2350
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,399
underway in the united states and

2351
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,960
they're being undertaken

2352
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:09,439
for multiple reasons the first of which

2353
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,520
is to

2354
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:12,479
identify active ingredients that will be

2355
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,800
safe to use

2356
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,238
in hemp and to address pest management

2357
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,719
needs in the u.s hemp

2358
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:20,638
industry the second reason is to

2359
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,279
identify herbicides that will be able to

2360
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,239
control

2361
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,279
hemp escapes that occur in following

2362
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:27,759
crops

2363
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,519
and the third reason is to characterize

2364
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,159
herbicide symptomology

2365
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,800
in the case of herbicide carryover or

2366
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,719
drift

2367
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:39,279
injury while there's considerable

2368
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,639
interest in conducting hemp herbicide

2369
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:43,198
trials

2370
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:44,159
very few have actually made it to formal

2371
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:46,879
publication

2372
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:49,039
stage yet the one exception being some

2373
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,279
work that's been recently undertaken by

2374
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:54,079
michael flesner's group

2375
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:55,279
at virginia tech university and this is

2376
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:58,000
a really good paper

2377
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:59,599
where they evaluated herbicide tolerance

2378
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,079
of industrial hemp

2379
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:06,079
in both greenhouse and field conditions

2380
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:08,158
so the objective of the research that

2381
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:08,960
was conducted in michael flesner's lab

2382
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:11,279
was to test

2383
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,279
hep tolerance to both pre-emergence and

2384
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,279
post-emergence herbicides

2385
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:17,519
and when we say pre-emergence herbicides

2386
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:20,479
we're talking soil applied herbicides

2387
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,719
and when we're talking we're talking

2388
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,718
fully or applied herbicides

2389
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,399
they did conduct this across years and

2390
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,840
they did do the studies in both

2391
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,719
greenhouse and in

2392
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,239
field trials and what they saw was

2393
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:36,639
variability across

2394
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:38,879
time and between growing conditions

2395
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,440
although with respect to the results

2396
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,600
they did find that esmetolochlor

2397
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,879
was the least injurious of the soil

2398
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,360
applied herbicides

2399
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,679
in the field although their greenhouse

2400
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:51,599
trials did suggest that other active

2401
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,199
ingredients may have potential for

2402
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,120
future research

2403
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,238
with respect to the foliar applied

2404
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:59,198
herbicides

2405
01:30:56,238 --> 01:31:00,959
quizalifop and cythoxadim which are both

2406
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,039
grass herbicides

2407
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,319
were found to be the least injurious of

2408
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:08,960
the post products

2409
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:08,960
along with clopirolid and bromoxinil

2410
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,359
i'd like you to know that we're also

2411
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:16,159
conducting herbicide trials

2412
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:16,960
here at cornell agritech these are the

2413
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:19,359
results from

2414
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,198
a preliminary screening project that

2415
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:23,439
we've started to look at the

2416
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:26,158
safety of post-emergence or foliar

2417
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:28,799
applied herbicides and industrial hemp

2418
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:30,960
and you can see that our results largely

2419
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,440
agree with those that were

2420
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,760
achieved by michael flechner's group

2421
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:36,799
primarily if we're looking at percent

2422
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,119
injury

2423
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:41,600
the post-emergence herbicides currently

2424
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:41,840
in our trial providing the least amount

2425
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,520
of

2426
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,719
injury to hemp are clethodyn which is a

2427
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:51,199
wssa1 herbicide

2428
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:51,198
clopyramid and bromoximil

2429
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,360
so we plan to continue these herbicide

2430
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:57,039
screens both

2431
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,399
in the greenhouse and under field

2432
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:01,920
conditions this fall

2433
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:02,238
and in 2021 the previous slide showed

2434
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,560
you

2435
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:06,479
our post-emergence herbicides that we're

2436
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,159
looking at we also have a suite of

2437
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,279
pre-emergence herbicides that we'll be

2438
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:11,198
evaluating

2439
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:14,158
and again we'll be doing it in both the

2440
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:16,000
greenhouse and field conditions

2441
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:18,479
we hope to have some trials describing

2442
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,039
the impacts of herbicide carry over and

2443
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,959
drift

2444
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:26,079
on crop growth and yield development

2445
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:28,719
we're also hoping to look at the biology

2446
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:29,279
of hemp and evaluate its competitiveness

2447
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,760
with both

2448
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:32,639
current weed issues such as velvet leaf

2449
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,719
foxtail

2450
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:36,880
find weed and nightshade and

2451
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:41,840
up-and-coming problems in new york such

2452
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,840
as palmer amaranth and waterhemp

2453
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:45,679
i'd like to thank you very much for

2454

if you'd like to get in touch with me to

2456
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:52,559
discuss weeds in weed management

2457
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:55,880
in hemp or in any specialty crops

2458

and instagram again thank you so much

2465
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:14,719
for coming and attending my talk

2466
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:16,158
i'll be present during the break if you

2467
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:20,079
have any questions

2468
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:20,079
and have a good rest of your day

2469
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,920
okay thanks very much lynn uh we now

2470
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:27,920
have time for our q and a session

2471
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,920
uh for about 15 minutes and then we'll

2472
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:34,079
take another five minute break

2473
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:37,119
uh so i've seen if uh our panelists here

2474
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:40,719
could unmute that would be great

2475
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:43,279
and uh i'll try to pick out some of the

2476
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:46,319
questions from the chat

2477
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:49,759
there were some questions about uh

2478
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:51,359
seeing leaf hoppers on hemp and gypsy

2479
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,079
moth on hemp

2480
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,359
uh mary do you want to comment on the

2481
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:58,960
potential impact of

2482
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:01,599
i think joe meant potato leaf hoppers

2483
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,239
yeah so i i did find some potato leaf

2484
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,039
hoppers

2485
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,079
um oh it's i don't remember exactly when

2486
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,279
probably at least

2487
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:09,840
six seven weeks ago now um a lot of

2488
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,639
adults

2489
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,079
they came in i was concerned and within

2490
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,199
two weeks they were all gone and they

2491
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:18,319
did not reproduce

2492
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:20,158
now i did hear from others that they

2493
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,439
have caused problems in the fields i

2494
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:22,960
were in

2495
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,719
they never reproduced and it's mainly

2496
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,079
the nymphs that are that cause the

2497
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,480
hopper burn and

2498
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:30,479
a lot of the feeding damage so i did not

2499
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,079
experience that um

2500
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:34,079
i don't know if other people have had

2501
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:34,960
issues with with leaf hopper but not

2502
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,119
that i'm aware of

2503
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,800
and for the gypsy moth those were in the

2504
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:41,279
high tunnel i found

2505
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,840
i think about two or three i don't know

2506
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:43,679
if it's

2507
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,880
actually a problem it happened to be

2508
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,960
there um

2509
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,480
i don't know if they how extensively

2510
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,439
they were feeding they probably nibbled

2511
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:51,279
a little bit um

2512
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:52,638
i don't think that gypsy moth is going

2513
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:54,079
to be a pest it's just

2514
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:56,079
one of those things that i found so i

2515
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:59,439
put it in the other insects i found

2516
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:00,800
category so one thing i if i have a

2517
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:03,039
minute just to mention one thing real

2518
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,840
quickly i said that i found some aphids

2519
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:06,399
on hemp

2520
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,880
and i sent them to the diagnostic lab so

2521
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,238
i received um verification that they are

2522
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,560
cannabis aphids which

2523
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:13,439
is the first verification in new york so

2524
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,719
we have it here

2525
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:19,118
um just so everybody's aware of

2526
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,639
yeah we had a lot of vapids last year at

2527
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:23,039
the end of the season

2528
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,679
did you get it did you find out what

2529
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:27,439
they were

2530
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:29,920
uh i thought we did have them

2531
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:30,799
confirmed as cannabis oh you did okay

2532
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,800
okay elsa

2533
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,079
told me that was for as far as he knew

2534
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:38,000
his first verification

2535
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:39,279
but okay uh let me just point it to

2536
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,359
jamie because

2537
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:43,439
uh again in the vines lab they have a

2538
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,439
lot of experience working with

2539
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:46,719
potato leafhopper and hopper burn on

2540
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:50,399
alfalfa

2541
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:54,000
and i know jamie if she's still on

2542
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:57,039
has seen some hopper burn on hemp

2543
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,158
in ithaca but she may not be on right

2544
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:00,399
now

2545
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:03,599
larry i can talk about that i i was in

2546
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:06,960
the the ithaca fiber and grain plots

2547
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,800
um i think last

2548
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,000
week it might have been the week before

2549
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:14,079
and there's considerable

2550
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:17,118
damage from potato leaf hopper on both

2551
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:20,319
on all on grain dual and

2552
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:22,079
fiber and it is quite striking and

2553
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:24,399
remarkable

2554
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:26,238
i am not an entomologist or insect

2555
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:29,439
person so i don't know what

2556
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:32,559
stage these insects are um but it

2557
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:35,039
is occurring and

2558
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,560
striking i will say that so i i don't

2559
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,359
know if they have good years and bad

2560
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,280
years but

2561
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:40,719
this was definitely a good year for

2562
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:44,479
potato leaf hopper

2563
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:46,639
on hemp in ithaca yeah yeah

2564
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:47,759
uh going back to some of the earlier

2565
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,880
questions uh

2566
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,520
to ally and chris uh folks were asking

2567
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,679
about

2568
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,719
uh whether we're asking both the

2569
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:58,239
volatile

2570
01:36:54,719 --> 01:37:01,359
terpenes and uh the non-volatile

2571
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:04,000
terpenes so unfortunately we haven't

2572
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:05,920
had the bandwidth to do as much detailed

2573
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,719
work on the terpenes as we would like

2574
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,960
but

2575
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:12,560
uh ali and chris where do we stand on

2576
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,600
characterization of all the different

2577
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,600
types of terpenes

2578
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:23,439
um so we're right now just looking at

2579
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,719
volatile terpenes um

2580
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:30,000
that's what we have standards for

2581
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:30,560
and um anything that's not a volatile

2582
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,600
were

2583
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,800
our cannabinoids

2584
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:39,119
generally so yeah

2585
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,920
right so um i think at the end of the

2586
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:43,198
season

2587
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:46,239
we'll um take flowers and get

2588
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:48,238
um total cannabinoid analysis and we'll

2589
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:52,319
be working with dennis to try to get

2590
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:52,319
a broader panel of terpenes as well

2591
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:59,279
great uh there's a question uh from

2592
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,319
jeff kostya to lin any work on ethyl

2593
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,800
floralin

2594
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:06,319
for pre-plant application and hemp has

2595
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,320
minor use approval in canada

2596
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,319
yeah and i i just sent a a written

2597
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:13,359
response to that

2598
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:15,118
so uh yes there there are there is some

2599
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:17,039
work that is being done

2600
01:38:15,118 --> 01:38:18,880
in the u.s in various labs looking at

2601
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:20,880
ethyl floralin as well as the other

2602
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,679
dinitro aniline

2603
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,600
herbicides so pendimethalin and

2604
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:27,840
trifluralin

2605
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,520
with i don't remember the exact results

2606
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,480
with ethyl floral and that i've seen

2607
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,199
there has been

2608
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:35,279
varied response and safety uh with

2609
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:37,599
respect to pentamethylene

2610
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:39,519
but pendimethaline ethyl fluorine and

2611
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,159
trifluralin are all going to be products

2612
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,840
that will be

2613
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:44,879
tested in our pre-emergence herbicide

2614
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,679
trials

2615
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,719
yeah let me just throw out a question

2616
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:52,158
probably

2617
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:55,279
to everyone and that is uh

2618
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:57,198
what is the potential outcome of using

2619
01:38:55,279 --> 01:39:01,599
some of these products

2620
01:38:57,198 --> 01:39:04,238
on the test results for cbd extracts

2621
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,039
so there is some evidence that hemp can

2622
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:08,079
concentrate

2623
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:10,158
uh some of these compounds and uh

2624
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,559
we do know through our interactions with

2625
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:15,279
the folks at pixas international

2626
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,320
that some of their hemp crops have

2627
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:19,439
failed

2628
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:20,880
in that final testing so growers

2629
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,198
definitely need to

2630
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,359
be in contact with their buyer and

2631
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:27,279
understand the standards

2632
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:29,359
for testing that's going to be done in

2633
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:32,158
the final cbd product anyone want to

2634
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:32,158
comment on that

2635
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:39,519
yeah i mean that's exactly right larry

2636
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,520
and um

2637
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,800
i've actually interacted with now two

2638
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,679
different growers here in the state of

2639
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,840
new york

2640
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,279
um that have gone through quality

2641
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,079
control testing

2642
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:50,880
um and had either you know they a

2643
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:52,880
microbial

2644
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,079
issue so things are they're tested for

2645
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:57,760
heavy metals

2646
01:39:54,079 --> 01:40:00,250
for pesticides and for microbials and

2647
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,600
so it is important to to

2648
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:03,760
[Music]

2649
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,199
know the final market know what's going

2650
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,400
to be tested and then i guess i would

2651
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:09,759
throw it to gary

2652
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:12,559
in terms of grain issues which are

2653
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,159
really important as well i don't know

2654
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,080
all the answers to the chris

2655
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:18,238
to that question and i think it's super

2656
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:21,118
important as you stated there

2657
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:22,000
we were both on a conference at the

2658
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:24,719
plant pathology

2659
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,439
meetings where speakers from canada were

2660
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,399
telling us

2661
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:29,678
absolutely nothing was allowed in end

2662
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:32,319
products no

2663
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:35,520
no residues of a biological control no

2664
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:38,960
residues of any kind of chemical

2665
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,000
so i don't know if the u.s industry will

2666
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,960
be

2667
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,319
uh handled that same way but uh it's a

2668
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,679
real concern

2669
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:50,319
um we're focused on trying to reduce any

2670
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:52,719
potential from mycotoxins uh which

2671
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:55,679
there's significant uh potential there

2672
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:56,880
um and that takes away a pretty big set

2673
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,960
of tools

2674
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,560
if we if we can't control things during

2675
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,719
the flowering process so

2676
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,480
that uh maybe somebody else on the call

2677
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:07,600
has some insights

2678
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:07,599
it's a real question

2679
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:16,719
lynn do you have any insights on

2680
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:20,559
herbicide carryover

2681
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:22,158
herbicide uptake from hemp

2682
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,600
yeah that's actually a really good

2683
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:25,679
question and and that is

2684
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,119
not a topic i think that any weed

2685
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,480
scientist debate has

2686
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:32,880
actually addressed um it's

2687
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:34,799
there was a in fact a lot of the weed

2688
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,199
science work hasn't been addressed at

2689
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,679
all

2690
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,879
to date and there was a actually a paper

2691
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:42,079
put out last year

2692
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:44,800
in 2019 kind of expressly saying how far

2693
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:46,479
behind we are with respect to all of

2694
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:49,600
these questions in the discipline

2695
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:52,718
so there's more that needs to be done

2696
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,800
yep and i'll just uh

2697
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:56,719
very briefly try to answer paul's

2698
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,840
question about what specific soil

2699
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:01,600
testing would you recommend

2700
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,400
pre-planting uh again i

2701
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,239
i know we have discussed this with our

2702
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:08,399
colleagues at pixas

2703
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:11,198
uh hemp is particularly good at taking

2704
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:11,198
up cadmium

2705
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:15,519
lead you don't want to plant on a field

2706
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:18,079
that has lead

2707
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,560
uh but we really have a lot more work to

2708
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:23,118
do

2709
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:25,119
to characterize uh what heavy metals

2710
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:27,198
you would want to test for and

2711
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:31,439
specifically avoid those fields

2712
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:34,319
implanting cbd hemp there may be other

2713
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,359
pesticide residues also that you would

2714
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:37,679
want to

2715
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:39,198
test for but we really don't have a good

2716
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,840
handle on that that's a very good

2717
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:44,079
question

2718
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:47,360
uh it's an interesting question here

2719
01:42:44,079 --> 01:42:49,439
or comment from raul at rutgers that

2720
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:50,639
uh they've had a substantial population

2721
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:55,198
of stink bugs

2722
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:57,760
in their cbd hemp trial uh

2723
01:42:55,198 --> 01:43:00,319
and marion do you want to comment on uh

2724
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,719
stink bugs

2725
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:04,479
so i've seen brown marmorated stink bugs

2726
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,560
and i found some stink bug

2727
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,238
egg masses um i've actually have some

2728
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,600
pictures of brown marmorated stink bugs

2729
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:12,238
mating in hemp

2730
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,960
um but have not seen a lot of feeding

2731
01:43:12,238 --> 01:43:14,559
damage

2732
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,319
i mentioned the majority of the feeding

2733
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,360
damage i've seen but it's also hard to

2734
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:19,118
distinguish sometimes

2735
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:21,039
feeding damage if i'm not actively

2736
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:23,198
seeing the insect feed

2737
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:24,800
there's a lot of other sucking insects

2738
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,638
that could have caused the damage

2739
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,639
so i have not personally observed a lot

2740
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:29,679
of stink bugs the only one i've seen is

2741
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,199
brown marmorated

2742
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:37,440
and um and a few stink bug egg masses

2743
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:40,719
yeah i was also asked a question about

2744
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,879
uh spotted lanternfly

2745
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:44,399
whether hemp might be a host for spotted

2746
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,960
lanternfly

2747
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:48,960
uh so far as far as i know in

2748
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,800
pennsylvania they have not seen

2749
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,480
and and i heard this from melissa

2750
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,199
collins at penn state

2751
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:57,359
uh they have not seen any damage to him

2752
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,118
from spotted lanternfly

2753
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:00,559
do you have any uh insights on that i

2754
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:02,479
have yeah i

2755
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,920
actually have no idea if they would get

2756
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:04,559
onto hemp or not it seems to have a

2757
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,000
pretty

2758
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:12,480
broad host range so potentially

2759
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,479
but yes i have no idea

2760
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:22,000
here's a question from josh with palmer

2761
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,439
amaranth in new york what challenges

2762
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,800
might we see in regard to hemp

2763
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:27,599
production and harvest

2764
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:30,639
are hemp harvesters harvesters capable

2765
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,639
of doing a good job

2766
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:38,560
so yeah um so

2767
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:40,879
i obviously have not dealt with with

2768
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,719
hemp and hemp harvest and and palmer

2769
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,719
amaranth but i have worked with palmer

2770
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:48,158
amaranth which is the weed behind me

2771
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,880
in almonds actually in california and uh

2772
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:50,079
yeah that's

2773
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,199
that that goes back to the

2774
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:55,760
harvestability issue um

2775
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:56,719
you know palmer amaranth gets very large

2776
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,840
very quickly

2777
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:01,118
uh it gets lignified and it can stop up

2778
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,000
cotton harvesters

2779
01:45:01,118 --> 01:45:06,158
and and you know a corn harvester so i

2780
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,118
expect that a significant population

2781
01:45:06,158 --> 01:45:09,519
will

2782
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:11,599
impede the harvestability of hemp as

2783
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,480
well

2784
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,440
yep i'll just comment that uh again for

2785
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:18,319
high quality

2786
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:20,638
fiber production fiber hemp production

2787
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:22,238
there is a very very low tolerance for

2788
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,560
weeds

2789
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:27,439
so it has been a challenge for us in the

2790
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:30,560
absence of any labeled herbicides

2791
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:33,599
to maintain to establish and maintain a

2792
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:35,440
weed spotless field that would meet

2793
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:38,880
those quality thresholds for

2794
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:40,719
high quality fiber harvest

2795
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,719
for those folks who have been looking at

2796
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:44,480
the chat any final questions you want to

2797
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:46,960
address here in our last minute before

2798
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:46,959
the break

2799
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:54,639
um i'm gonna i'm gonna throw there was a

2800
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,199
question about crop density

2801
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,319
and uh weed control and that falls into

2802
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,279
that that last

2803
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:02,319
uh bullet point from my slide of future

2804
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:04,000
research

2805
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:05,920
um that's going to look at the

2806
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,800
competitiveness of hemp

2807
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,639
with various weed species and crop

2808
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,199
density impacts are going to be rolled

2809
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:14,239
into

2810
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:16,719
into that so i don't

2811
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:18,479
there is work that is being done nothing

2812
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:20,399
by other universities nothing has been

2813
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:21,279
published yet but i'll be doing some of

2814
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,879
that work here

2815
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:28,000
hopefully in the coming um 2021.

2816
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:29,199
yeah and again we in in cbd hemp at

2817
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,319
least we've relied

2818
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:33,519
on uh plastic mulch heavily for weed

2819
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:36,399
management

2820
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:38,400
but as the industry shifts to more broad

2821
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:40,000
acre direct seeded plantings

2822
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:42,000
uh those studies are going to be

2823
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,039
critical so it's great to have lynn

2824
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,479
on our team there is a question about um

2825
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:50,880
xerotal and powdery mildew and i have um

2826
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:52,879
tested that so xerotal is going to

2827
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,560
sanitize whatever it touches

2828
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,319
but it will become ineffective very

2829
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:00,320
quickly and so

2830
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:02,639
um uh in in what we have done to date

2831
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:04,559
and we are expanding this but other

2832
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:08,239
products including

2833
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,960
bacillus based products and um oil based

2834
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:12,000
products

2835
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,639
when applied prior to powdery mildew

2836
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,960
getting there

2837
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:17,279
are much more effective than the xero

2838
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:20,960
tall in our studies

2839
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:22,559
great uh just one final uh

2840
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:25,118
comment here there have been a couple of

2841
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,320
questions about recommending labs for

2842
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:29,039
testings

2843
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:31,039
uh we are we're not going to recommend a

2844
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,760
particular lab we don't have a

2845
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:36,079
validation protocol for validating the

2846
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,119
results from different commercial labs

2847
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:40,639
but we do have a listing of potential

2848
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:44,158
labs that you can use

2849
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:46,960
in particular uh ones that can test for

2850
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:47,839
heavy metals and toxins are are kind of

2851
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,800
rare they're

2852
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,319
relatively few and if you go to our

2853
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:55,440
website we try to maintain

2854
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:57,599
a complete list of lab resources that

2855
01:47:55,439 --> 01:48:00,799
you could potentially use

2856
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,840
but i won't call them recommendations so

2857
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,159
we're going to take a break here it's 10

2858
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,239
56.

2859
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:08,238
so another five minute break and we will

2860
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:10,718
be back at 11 o'clock with

2861
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:11,759
our presentation from alan taylor thanks

2862
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,279
very much everyone

2863
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,280
to uh our panelists

2864
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:21,198
okay it's 1101 we're going to move on to

2865
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:24,719
our third

2866
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:27,359
session here uh

2867
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:29,118
talking about uh supply chains and

2868
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:31,920
regulatory issues

2869
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:33,599
we are going to start with a talk from

2870
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:36,399
alan taylor

2871
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,639
on seed treatments and soil-borne

2872
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:42,000
pathogens

2873
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:42,000
my name is alan taylor

2874
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:47,118
professor of seed science and technology

2875
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:49,600
at cornell agritech

2876
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:51,599
my laboratory has been involved in hemp

2877
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:53,199
seed science and technology research

2878
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,639
since the cornell hemp team

2879
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:57,359
formed in 2017. what i'm going to speak

2880
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:00,880
about

2881
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:03,679
today is on our work on the research and

2882
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:06,159
development of hemp seed treatments

2883
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:06,960
gary bergstrom is my cooperator in plant

2884
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:10,079
pathology

2885
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:12,639
as his laboratory is supportive

2886
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:13,840
and helping characterize the pathogens

2887
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:15,920
associated with

2888
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,039
disease seedlings from our research

2889
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,679
plots

2890
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:21,439
we also have phil trials at north dakota

2891
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:24,319
state with burton johnson

2892
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:26,960
and chuck johnson and john fike at

2893
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:29,840
virginia tech

2894
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:32,158
so the focus of our work is on

2895
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:35,199
application technology to begin

2896
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,559
with to have good methodology

2897
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:41,198
for seed treatment and coding

2898
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:44,000
technologies this is a laboratory scale

2899
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:46,079
unit called a rotary pan technology an

2900
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
r6 for a six inch diameter

2901
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:49,439
this same technology is used for

2902
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,679
commercial scale equipment

2903
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:55,279
so anything that we do in the laboratory

2904
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:57,760
can quickly be scaled up to a larger

2905
01:49:55,279 --> 01:50:00,238
an issue that we had early on is that we

2906
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,520
need to ensure that we have a uniformity

2907
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:03,919
of application

2908
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,560
over the seed surface and from seed to

2909
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,079
seed

2910
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:10,960
we need to protect each seed from attack

2911
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:12,800
of the soil borne pathogens at time of

2912
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,480
sowing

2913
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,560
we'll take a step back and look at the

2914
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:17,359
biological market as there's a number of

2915
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,199
materials

2916
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:21,118
now this is not restricted to seed

2917
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:22,238
treatments these could be foliar

2918
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:24,319
applications

2919
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:26,559
or soil applications and furrow

2920
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:28,238
applications we have bio fertilizers and

2921
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,560
biostimulants which we're not going to

2922
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:32,238
be talking about

2923
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,080
even though my laboratory is working

2924
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:36,000
with biostimulant seed treatments

2925
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:37,679
we're going to focus on biological

2926
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,760
control products

2927
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:41,679
in particular the bio pesticides so

2928
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,960
we're going to kind of focus in on that

2929
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:45,199
area

2930
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,719
so under the bio pesticides we have

2931
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:49,598
biochemicals

2932
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:50,319
they may be kind of a mineral based they

2933
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,960
can be either

2934
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:54,559
formed from copper or phosphites we have

2935
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,319
examples of those

2936
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,400
microbials we normally think of a

2937
01:50:56,319 --> 01:51:00,559
microbial as a biopesticide

2938
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:01,519
but they're not the only materials but

2939
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,159
in this case

2940
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,480
we are using specific seed treatments of

2941
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:08,638
from bacillus and trichoderma

2942
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:09,759
and with others and these are commercial

2943
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,880
formulations

2944
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,000
that we are testing on as seed

2945
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,760
treatments

2946
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,760
so this is our list of 12 seed

2947
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,599
treatments that we have those in green

2948
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,560
are the biologicals

2949
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,520
first thing we have to do is test the

2950
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,840
seed treatment

2951
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:28,000
application rate we want to ensure that

2952
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:30,960
there's no phytotoxicity

2953
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,399
from the seed treatments those in red

2954
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,480
are the biochemicals

2955
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:36,799
safeguard is an organic copper the

2956
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:39,519
prudent is a phosphite material

2957
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,320
and then the group at the bottom in blue

2958
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:45,119
apron xl maxim you probably recognize

2959
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:45,920
as these are widely labeled on

2960
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:51,279
vegetables

2961
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:51,279
and field crops for as seed treatments

2962
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:58,480
so first let's look at what happens

2963
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,800
to seeds after they're planted we start

2964
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:04,079
off here in the laboratory to look at

2965
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:06,560
hemp seeds germinate very rapidly so in

2966
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:07,279
this pathogen-infested soil that we have

2967
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:09,119
the soil

2968
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:10,639
sprinkled over on top during the

2969
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:12,719
germination process

2970
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,920
after four days the seeds germinate very

2971
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:16,158
rapidly

2972
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,000
after seven days many of the seedlings

2973
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:21,279
have died or are dying

2974
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,840
and by 10 days non-treated seeds

2975
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:24,399
are killed so this is a way that we can

2976
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:27,679
use

2977
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:30,359
a laboratory screening method taking

2978
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:33,199
advantage of a naturally pathogenic

2979
01:52:30,359 --> 01:52:34,799
pathogen-infested soil to go ahead and

2980
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:37,439
to test these

2981
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,320
seed treatments before we actually go to

2982
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:40,960
the field

2983
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:41,599
but our primary interest in showing you

2984
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,158
today

2985
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:45,039
is the field data this is our two we

2986
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:47,920
have two stick

2987
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:49,599
field studies at cornell the first one

2988
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,279
planted in june 12.

2989
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,279
again now we can see how this color

2990
01:52:51,279 --> 01:52:55,840
coding is going to help us the black bar

2991
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:58,158
on the left is the control non-treated

2992
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,319
you see all the green treatments none of

2993
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:02,079
the biological is doing any better than

2994
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:04,880
the control

2995
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:06,639
however the safeguard the organic copper

2996
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,239
the the prudent the phosphite doing

2997
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:12,079
quite well and as good as

2998
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:15,198
one of our best apron maxim treatments

2999
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:17,039
so this looks very promising we have a

3000
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:20,479
second study

3001
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,760
also in ithaca this year planted on june

3002
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:24,399
26th

3003
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:26,320
again the same trend is the biologicals

3004
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:27,839
not performing any better than the

3005
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:31,039
non-treated control

3006
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,760
we are seeing improvements with both the

3007
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:33,359
safeguard

3008
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,840
in particular the safeguard and the

3009
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:39,359
prudent and again it's comparable to

3010
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:42,480
our best apron maxim treatment as the

3011
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:42,479
chemical seed treatment

3012
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,520
this is where gary's laboratory was was

3013
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:50,079
instrumental in supporting this project

3014
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,159
we would see the symptoms in the field

3015
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:54,198
as far as disease seedlings

3016
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,519
his laboratory has done the

3017
01:53:54,198 --> 01:53:58,319
characterization

3018
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:00,080
of what pathogens are associated with

3019
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:00,639
those disease seedlings so we can see

3020
01:54:00,079 --> 01:54:02,559
here

3021
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,840
in the picture on the the photo at the

3022
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:06,239
bottom on the left

3023
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:08,319
uh indicative of those testing positive

3024
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:10,799
for fusarium species

3025
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:13,118
they picture on the lower right having

3026
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,079
pythium species present

3027
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:18,559
gary's laboratory is still ongoing work

3028
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:20,880
to characterize the species

3029
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:22,400
of these along with other samples that

3030
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,359
we have provided

3031
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:27,279
to their lab as i said this is a

3032
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:29,279
multi-state project and being a

3033
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:33,039
multi-state project

3034
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:35,359
is good in that we do not want to simply

3035
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:36,238
have seeds that are tested in cornell

3036
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:38,960
that only

3037
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:41,359
have good control in the northeast so

3038
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,920
we've expanded the testing we have

3039
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:45,039
uh seed testing at virginia tech in the

3040
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,639
southern region

3041
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:50,719
and then north dakota state and the

3042
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:53,039
north central region

3043
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:54,239
again the same color coding in the same

3044
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:56,880
uh scheme

3045
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:58,399
as we had in our previous slides we see

3046
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:01,359
safeguard and prudent

3047
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:03,279
doing very well and this is from one

3048
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:06,000
study we have there'll be one more study

3049
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:07,279
coming with data this fall from virginia

3050
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,679
tech

3051
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:10,960
and then north dakota state in this case

3052
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:11,679
we're seeing the chemical seed

3053
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:15,118
treatments

3054
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:16,158
doing quite well in this one across the

3055
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:17,839
board

3056
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:20,319
but still we're seeing for example

3057
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:23,119
safeguard doing a nice job

3058
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:23,679
so we're we're gathering information now

3059
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:26,238
in the

3060
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:26,719
very good picture is that we're seeing

3061
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:30,079
some

3062
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:33,359
consistency in our results

3063
01:55:30,079 --> 01:55:36,639
from field to field and from

3064
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:39,679
location to location within the regions

3065
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:42,880
of the united states so let's go ahead

3066
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:44,719
and summarize where we're at with this

3067
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:46,000
our biochemical seed treatments the

3068
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:48,560
safeguard which was the

3069
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,840
organic copper and the prudent which is

3070
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,639
a phosphite

3071
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,079
had good efficacy in all the studies the

3072
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:57,679
data that we have in hand

3073
01:55:54,079 --> 01:56:00,399
at this point in time the chemical seed

3074
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:02,880
treatments apron xl and maxim still

3075
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:04,000
had good efficacy and again these are

3076
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,000
tried and true

3077
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,319
chemical seed treatments that are widely

3078
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,960
labeled

3079
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:12,079
unfortunately after two years of work

3080
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:14,560
where syngenta

3081
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:15,359
was initially very interested in this

3082
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:18,719
project

3083
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:19,598
syngenta is no longer providing support

3084
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,920
for hemp

3085
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:23,920
on any particular application so it

3086
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:25,440
could be syngenta herbicides

3087
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,199
and things like that they're not going

3088
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:28,479
to be supporting those hemp labels the

3089
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:32,238
united states which is

3090
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:35,678
is a big setback so we really need other

3091
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:38,479
chemical seed treatments from another

3092
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:40,079
company to test and we're looking into

3093
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:43,198
that at this time

3094
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:46,238
finally the biologicals and we've done

3095
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:49,198
now two years in a row trying to test

3096
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:51,519
a good range of commercially available

3097
01:56:49,198 --> 01:56:54,158
and used biological seed treatments

3098
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:55,280
simply were not effective in our study

3099
01:56:54,158 --> 01:56:58,079
to control

3100
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:58,079
damping off

3101
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:03,198
so i want to thank people first of all

3102
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:06,319
in my laboratory

3103
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:08,799
hillary mayton hillary kind of

3104
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:11,198
headed up all the field studies that you

3105
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:14,320
had as well as gathering data

3106
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:16,638
from the other states

3107
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:18,479
and then summarizing some of the data in

3108
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:20,880
the graphs that you're seeing

3109
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:21,759
michael loose in my laboratory has done

3110
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:24,000
all the seed

3111
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:27,039
treatment application a lot of the

3112
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,079
in-house testing as far as germination

3113
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:32,000
soil testing and i saw a bio assay

3114
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:33,920
massey's done a lot of the photographic

3115
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,960
work and other support work for this

3116
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:37,039
project so

3117
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,319
very nice team that i'm very fortunate

3118
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:41,359
to have people

3119
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:43,198
working with me on this project in

3120
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:45,920
gary's laboratory

3121
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:46,799
jen starr was really instrumental in

3122
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:49,440
working

3123
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,119
with hillary taking those field samples

3124
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:53,198
and doing the characterization

3125
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,118
and kevin and gary's lab is helping at

3126
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:57,919
the molecular characterization

3127
01:57:55,118 --> 01:57:59,920
so we know what species are involved

3128
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,679
again we work very closely with the

3129
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,480
company registrants in other words the

3130
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,639
companies that

3131
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:06,319
actually are producing these we're

3132
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:08,800
working directly with our r

3133
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:10,158
d people to make sure that we're testing

3134
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,880
the best

3135
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:14,719
biological chemical biochemical

3136
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:17,359
treatment that they would have available

3137
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:18,158
for this project and finally i want to

3138
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:21,118
thank

3139
01:58:18,158 --> 01:58:22,719
support from ir4 but in particular for

3140
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:24,079
new york ag and markets for their

3141
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:26,399
continued support

3142
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:27,599
for this and for other cornell hemp

3143
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:30,799
projects

3144
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,800
thank you very much

3145
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:36,880
okay thanks very much alan we are going

3146
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:38,639
to move on now

3147
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,239
because we have three short

3148
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:42,400
presentations

3149
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:44,000
from some of my colleagues in cornell

3150
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:46,799
cooperative extension

3151
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,719
talking about their work on the

3152
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:52,960
economics and supply chains

3153
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:55,359
starting with john hanchak

3154
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:57,039
good morning my name is john hanchar i

3155
01:58:55,359 --> 01:58:59,359
am with cornell university and a member

3156
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:01,039
of the cornell university hemp group

3157
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:02,479
that is stunning hemp production in new

3158
01:59:01,039 --> 01:59:04,479
york state

3159
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:06,319
lindsey paschall and mary ulrich also

3160
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:08,399
with cornell university and i have been

3161
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:10,719
doing research and extension work

3162
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:16,559
on the economic aspects of growing hemp

3163
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:19,039
in new york

3164
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,719
lindsay mary and i will be presenting

3165
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,880
update type information from an

3166
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:25,039
economics perspective

3167
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,760
based upon our cost of production work i

3168
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:29,359
will describe the economic environment

3169
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,960
the market signals which growers

3170
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:34,000
considered earlier in the year

3171
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,840
regarding planting decisions lindsay

3172
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,760
will then provide update information for

3173
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,279
processing retail and consumer

01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,520
activities

3175
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:42,880
mary will discuss what do growers need

3176
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:47,679
to be thinking of

3177
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,679
to obtain viable hemp enterprises

3178
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,079
cost of production and expected prices

3179
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,440
are key determinants of growers planting

3180
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:57,679
decisions

3181
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:59,519
should i produce or not if production

3182
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:01,440
makes sense then how much

3183
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,719
should i plan to supply at expected

3184
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:05,118
prices

3185
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:07,279
acreage and production input decisions

3186
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:11,839
are involved

3187
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:13,039
item one figure one contains information

3188
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,599
produced by cornell

3189
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:17,439
university and others for cornell

analysis for a plastic culture system

3193
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,199
suggests variable costs and total costs

3194
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:36,079
equal twelve thousand

3195
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:37,839
six hundred and thirteen thousand one

3196
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:41,279
hundred dollars per acre

3197
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,880
respectively the cornell work excludes a

3198
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:44,880
charge for the value of management

3199
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:47,679
inputs required

3200
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:49,359
and reflects pre-planting inputs tasks

3201
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:51,520
to the point where dry

3202
02:00:49,359 --> 02:00:52,479
material is in totes ready for immediate

3203
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:56,960
delivery

3204
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:56,959
or ready for storage in future delivery

3205
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:05,119
item two the other studies

3206
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:07,279
use similar cost to production methods

3207
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:09,198
but the items included in time periods

3208
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:11,439
considered differed

3209
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:13,039
for example the university of

3210
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:14,960
connecticut values

3211
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:16,079
include a charge for management inputs

3212
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:20,560
required

3213
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:20,559
various marketing expenses and others

3214
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,920
variable costs for the five study ranged

3215
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,320
from

3216
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,239
eight thousand eight hundred dollars to

3217
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:29,759
thirteen thousand four hundred dollars

3218
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:31,839
per acre

3219
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:34,639
the five study average was twelve

3220
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:37,920
thousand two hundred dollars per acre

3221
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:39,920
for the variable cost measure total

3222
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,279
costs ranged from nine thousand two

3223
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,118
hundred dollars

3224
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:44,639
to nineteen thousand three hundred

3225
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:47,920
dollars

3226
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:51,840
per acre the five study average was

3227
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:51,840
fourteen thousand dollars per acre

3228
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:58,000
item three calculated break-even prices

3229
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:59,440
the expected prices received that would

3230
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,760
cover variable

3231
02:01:59,439 --> 02:02:02,799
and total cost using the five study

3232
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:06,480
averages

3233
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:10,000
equaled 1.31 and 1.51

3234
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:10,559
dollars per percent cbd per pound of dry

3235
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,079
matter

3236
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:16,880
respectively given percent cbd

3237
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:18,319
equals six dry matter per plant equal

3238
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,359
one pound

3239
02:02:18,319 --> 02:02:22,319
and harvested plants per acre equal one

3240
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:26,960
thousand

3241
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:28,880
five hundred fifty plants

3242
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,039
expected prices for the two thousand

twenty growing in harvest year

3244
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:37,359
late 2019 of about a dollar

3245
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:40,559
in early 2020 about

3246
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:42,719
65 cents relative to cost suggests a

3247
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,679
relatively unfavorable economic

3248
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:47,840
environment

3249
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,840

3250
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:55,679
item four in summary

3251
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,840
there are three aspects that this

3252
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,920
information supports

3253
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,639
and unvei unfavorable economic

3254
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:05,359
environment unfavorable market signals

3255
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:05,840
was being considered by growers as they

3256
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,960
made

3257
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:11,199
planting decisions early in the year

3258
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:14,399
especially when compared to expectations

3259
02:03:11,198 --> 02:03:18,399
for alternative horticulture crops

3260
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:22,479
risks and uncertainties still concern

check-in call

3266
02:03:30,079 --> 02:03:33,920

activity

3268
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:38,158
that is hemp production is a fraction of

3269
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:43,678
what it was last year

3270

new york team i will be discussing the

3280
02:04:08,078 --> 02:04:11,599
supply chain for industrial hemp in new

3281
02:04:10,078 --> 02:04:14,319
york state

3282
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,920
with discussions about stated processors

3283
02:04:14,319 --> 02:04:18,559
a little bit about retailers and

3284
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,560
consumers

3285
02:04:23,198 --> 02:04:28,078
in may 2020 a survey was sent out to the

3286
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:29,759
hemp processors

3287
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:32,559
in new york state to find out what the

3288
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:35,679
state of hemp

3289
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:37,520
processing happened in 2019 out of a

3290
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:40,158
little over a hundred

3291
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:41,599
processors in new york state only 24

3292
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:43,839
responded

3293
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:44,960
13 said that they did process hemp in

3294
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:48,560
new york state

3295
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:48,560
and 11 said that they did not

3296
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:53,759
we asked how much hemp did you process

3297
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,118
in 2019 um

3298
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:00,880
11 respondents did not process any hemp

3299
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:04,399
and then the hemp range between 0 and

3300
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:08,639
28 278 pounds

3301
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:10,960
with a total of 122 088 pounds

3302
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:11,679
processed in new york state according to

3303
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:15,520
the

3304
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:15,520
um respondents

3305
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:24,158
in 2019 um we asked

3306
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:26,000
what the minimum cbd content that hemp

3307
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:28,000
process required

3308
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,238
from their growers it ranged anywhere

3309
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,439
from zero to 12 percent

3310
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:35,839
of cbd percentage they would like from

3311
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:35,839
growers

3312
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:44,560
then we asked processors what their

3313
02:05:42,078 --> 02:05:47,599
processing happened to

3314
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:51,760
this included hemp oil seed cake

3315
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:55,520
biofuel plastic raw materials hemp fiber

3316
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:59,119
pellets and that was for pellet stoves

3317
02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:04,960
extracts such as powders base oil

3318
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:04,960
protein tinctures flower and cbd

3319
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:12,480
in 2020

3320
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:17,679
we wanted to know what processors were

3321
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:20,639
looking at for their capacity

3322
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:21,440
for processing hemp and you know the

3323
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,599
range is

3324
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:28,638
kind of all of the board but included

3325
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:31,840
weekly basis of 200 pounds

3326
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:34,400
some processors said for a month they

3327
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:35,279
could only do about two acres or

3328
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:39,359
anywhere between

3329
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:41,759
a thousand and 140 000 pounds

3330
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:45,279
um with also some processors responding

3331
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:47,360
that they could do anywhere from 6 000

3332
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:50,158
to a million pounds

3333
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:50,158
within the year

3334
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:56,000
there's not a lot of information out

3335
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:56,480
there in new york state about the state

3336
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,198
of

3337
02:06:56,479 --> 02:06:59,839
retailers and consumers this will

3338
02:06:59,198 --> 02:07:02,960
probably be

3339
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,679
potentially a future survey for to find

3340
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,520
out from

3341
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:06,800
retailers consumers where the industry

3342
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:09,119
is

3343
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:11,199
there's a lot of predictions online

3344
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:14,158
about how

3345
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:16,799
um retail stores might end up closing

3346
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:19,759
because of cobit 19.

3347
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,560
you know a lot of people can buy cbd

3348
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,280
locally

3349
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:25,039
or they can buy it online so the retail

3350
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:28,800
side is very unpredictable

3351
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:32,319
um and so is on the consumer side

3352
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:35,119
there's large predictions that

3353
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:41,439
cbd consumption will continue to

3354
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:43,679
increase between 2020 and 2024

3355
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:45,759
if you have any other questions about

3356
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,078
hemp processors in your state please

3357
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,480
feel free to reach out to me my email

3358
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:55,840
address is

3359
02:07:49,479 --> 02:07:55,839
lep67 cornell.edu

3360
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,880
good afternoon i'm mary ulrich with

3361
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:01,679
quinoa cooperative extension in orange

3362
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:04,319
county

3363
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:05,920
i two am on the hemp team and i'm going

3364
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:08,238
to address a little bit about risk and

3365
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:11,279
reward because of course the question

3366
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,238
this year is the reward of hemp the

3367
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:15,519
potential for

3368
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:18,319
profit balance out with the risk

3369
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:18,880
because those two things should be in

3370
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:20,960
direct

3371
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:22,639
proportion to one another but they may

3372
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:25,198
not be

3373
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:26,000
and so has hemp and all rainbows and

3374
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,559
kittens

3375
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,560
or is it a little wild westy i've seen a

3376
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:31,760
lot of wild westy out there in the last

3377
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,280
couple of years

3378
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:36,880
and so i'm going to address a couple of

3379
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:39,359
ways to protect yourself from

3380
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:40,560
the bad actors and other potential

3381
02:08:39,359 --> 02:08:43,920
negatives that

3382
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:45,679
occur so how's risk measured and

3383
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:46,960
mitigated you know we use cost of

3384
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:50,000
production data

3385
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:51,599
john mentioned that it's coming along

3386
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
but the future market certainly is

3387
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:57,199
questionable we certainly do need more

3388
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,078
of uh more interest from consumers to

3389
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:00,879
keep that price

3390
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:02,960
up to keep the demand up we also

3391
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:04,560
mitigate risk with crop insurance

3392
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,078
i don't know what the payments i haven't

3393
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:08,159
talked to anybody who

3394
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:09,519
signed up for crop insurance and i mean

3395
02:09:08,158 --> 02:09:13,198
the usda

3396
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:14,639
fsa crop insurance

3397
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:16,479
so i don't know what those payments are

3398
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:18,319
going to be for 2020.

3399
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:19,598
my prediction last year was that they

3400
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:21,599
were either going to be really good or

3401
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:22,480
really bad and so we'll see what happens

3402
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:24,159
with them

3403
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:25,839
i'm always curious to talk to people

3404
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:27,118
who've had insurance so if you've had

3405
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:30,239
insurance please

3406
02:09:27,118 --> 02:09:33,920
give me a ring because private or the

3407
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:36,479
federal government supported ones

3408
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:38,800
that would be i'd love that information

3409
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:40,158
so and also one way to protect yourself

3410
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:43,440
or to

3411
02:09:40,158 --> 02:09:46,399
mitigate risk is to have a contract and

3412
02:09:43,439 --> 02:09:48,479
of course with the 2018 farm bill

3413
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:51,039
going to be brought into effect in new

3414
02:09:48,479 --> 02:09:52,959
york state by the end of the year

3415
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:54,719
there's lots of changes in the landscape

3416
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,840
happening and of course we're not used

3417
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:58,078
to

3418
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:00,159
legislation changing so quickly around

3419
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:00,880
crops but the last few years this has

3420
02:10:00,158 --> 02:10:02,799
been

3421
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,719
quite a little roller coaster so that in

3422
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,679
itself is a risk that you don't know

3423
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:08,319
where things are going to go

3424
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:10,880
legislatively of course the big

3425
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:13,679
force measure or the big risk is that

3426
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:15,599
fda may decide to

3427
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:17,199
regulate the crop particularly in the

3428
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:20,480
case of cbd

3429
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:24,559
and that could have a huge impact

3430
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:28,238
on markets production if fda said no no

3431
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:30,000
this is a drug and everybody has to have

3432
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:32,638
just like a drug everybody has to have

3433
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,520
the same kind of testing and monitoring

3434
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:36,880
then there would be a lot of producers

3435
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:39,040
and processors

3436
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:40,319
that would no longer have a market

3437
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:41,519
because they couldn't meet those

3438
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:43,198
requirements

3439
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:44,480
and so the other thing i just want to

3440
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:46,319
say about contracts you know if it

3441
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:49,439
sounds too good to be

3442
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:51,359
true it probably is and

3443
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:52,479
i'm going to show you a flyer in a

3444
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:55,039
minute that

3445
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:57,519
can help you out in terms of contracts

3446
02:10:55,039 --> 02:11:01,039
so what's the biggest thing that i see

3447
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:04,079
as a problem with hemp

3448
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:04,479
contracts or hemp relationships right

3449
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:07,118
now

3450
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:07,759
is that there's no collective knowledge

3451
02:11:07,118 --> 02:11:10,000
you know we

3452
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:12,239
for produce we have the blue book so the

3453
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,520
people can go look up buyers in new york

3454
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:16,718
state

3455
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:18,800
buyers are bonded so that if

3456
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,560
a seller doesn't get paid they can go to

3457
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:22,159
the state and get reimbursed through

3458
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:24,159
that bonding process

3459
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:25,679
if you know they really didn't get paid

3460
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:27,920
for something that they sold and

3461
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:30,880
everything was supposed to be okay

3462
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,440
and the seller just didn't get their

3463
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,279
money

3464
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:35,118
there's a way to get it back but in hemp

3465
02:11:33,279 --> 02:11:37,439
that doesn't exist right now

3466
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:38,639
and there's no institutional memory

3467
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:42,158
which we should have

3468
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:44,960
or we have in other businesses you know

3469
02:11:42,158 --> 02:11:46,960
who is going to pay you you know who the

3470
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:49,279
traditional bad actors are you know the

3471
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,239
guys who pay in 30 60 90 and the ones

3472
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:52,158
who don't

3473
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,718
if you don't know your neighbors do and

3474
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:56,960
so sharing information about that

3475
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:58,399
and other crops has been very open and

3476
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:00,719
hemp it has not been so

3477
02:11:58,399 --> 02:12:02,158
even what little institutional memory is

3478
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:05,679
being gathered

3479
02:12:02,158 --> 02:12:07,118
it's not being shared and so it seems

3480
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:09,920
like

3481
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:11,598
bad actors are going from farm to farm

3482
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:13,199
or from region to region

3483
02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:14,719
and causing trouble and certainly this

3484
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:16,879
isn't just about cbd

3485
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:18,239
i've had it happen that folks selling

3486
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:19,520
grain came to me

3487
02:12:18,238 --> 02:12:21,439
because they didn't get paid for their

3488
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:23,360
grain because the buyer said

3489
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:25,118
that it was moldy but didn't was moldy

3490
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,279
until like three months later

3491
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:29,519
so there's no way to trace back whose

3492
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:33,198
fault that was it was just very

3493
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:34,880
um unfortunate and so also very unusual

3494
02:12:33,198 --> 02:12:37,839
relationships between

3495
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:40,159
value and cost that the farmer needs to

3496
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,239
buy into the processing somehow

3497
02:12:40,158 --> 02:12:43,198
which is really you know not the case

3498
02:12:42,238 --> 02:12:45,919
ocean spray

3499
02:12:43,198 --> 02:12:46,879
you know really doesn't need the farmers

3500
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,440
necessarily

3501
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:50,560
to buy into the processing part itself

3502
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:52,879
they might be a co-op

3503
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:53,920
in terms of selling but do they own the

3504
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:57,840
equipment

3505
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:59,520
maybe not or orange juice companies or

3506
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,880
any of those

3507
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:03,679
there isn't that same kind of need to be

3508
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:05,199
involved

3509
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:07,199
there's a lot of interest from people

3510
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:08,238
who have never been involved in

3511
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:10,158
agriculture

3512
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:11,919
that can be a little bit of a problem

3513
02:13:10,158 --> 02:13:13,279
there's also what i call the billionaire

3514
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,719
rule there's a lot of folks running

3515
02:13:13,279 --> 02:13:16,399
around saying oh i have billionaire

3516
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:17,520
friends well unless you see a picture of

3517
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:19,279
him with

3518
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:21,760
warren buffett like on his christmas

3519
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:24,000
card don't believe it

3520
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:25,679
so one of the local growers actually

3521
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,118
said if it's a good party it'll still be

3522
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:28,880
going in a couple of years

3523
02:13:27,118 --> 02:13:30,399
and if it's a bad party i never wanted

3524
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:32,000
to go in the first place

3525
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:33,279
he said that one question about why he

3526
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,920
was because he was going to grow and

3527
02:13:33,279 --> 02:13:35,920
then

3528
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,039
changed his mind in the last minute and

3529
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:40,239
19

3530
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:44,158
and so just um using caution

3531
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:45,839
so to try and um

3532
02:13:44,158 --> 02:13:47,519
more closely at some of those contract

3533
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:51,520
details there's this

3534
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:53,360
uh six page pamphlet the first two pages

3535
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:55,520
are about production stuff but then the

3536
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:57,598
next four about contracts

3537
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:00,960
i wrote it with the assistance of

3538
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:04,159
several attorneys agricultural attorneys

3539
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:05,840
and so uh just have a look at that it's

3540
02:14:04,158 --> 02:14:09,439
on both the cornell website

3541
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:11,840
and the hemp blog which here's the pages

3542
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:13,759
and so the blog is on the left

3543
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:15,599
that's what it looks like and so there's

3544
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:17,760
regular news updates there

3545
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,039
and updates for meetings and things like

3546
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:20,079
that there's also the link for the

3547
02:14:19,039 --> 02:14:21,519
contract thing

3548
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:24,319
and on the right don't forget that

3549
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:26,560
cornell has its own website

3550
02:14:24,319 --> 02:14:28,319
and then the team whether it's other

3551
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:31,520

way through the postal service as well

3597
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:25,118
we wanted to be sure that we sent that

3598
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:28,639
out multiple ways so that

3599
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:30,960
folks would would get the message as

3600
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:33,040
quick as possible

3601
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:34,959
we really spent the last six or eight

3602
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:38,399
months here in the department

3603
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:41,518
uh working on and looking at

3604
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:43,519
uh what the requirements of the 2018

3605
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:47,359
farm bill program were

3606
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:48,239
uh as many of you uh you know know we

3607
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:51,920
sent in

3608
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:52,959
uh comments on the uh federal interim

3609
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:56,318
rule

3610
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:58,839
uh you all sent in many comments there's

3611
02:16:56,318 --> 02:17:00,478
a lot of commonality among those

3612
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:04,079
comments and

3613
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:05,519
identified a number of barriers related

3614
02:17:04,079 --> 02:17:08,000
to

3615
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:09,760
hemp for growers going forward under the

3616
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,079
2018 rules

3617
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:14,398
as well as four states going forward

3618
02:17:12,079 --> 02:17:18,478
under the 2018 rules

3619
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:22,159
we had an informal deadline with usda

3620
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:26,239
ams the states did as far as

3621
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:29,679
submitting plans for consideration

3622
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:31,039
that deadline was august 15th uh we were

3623
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:33,519
deliberating here

3624
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:34,559
uh within the agency and outside the

3625
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:38,239
agency

3626
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:40,000
uh frankly right up until uh that august

3627
02:17:38,239 --> 02:17:43,920
15th deadline

3628
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:47,519
about uh what direction to go in

3629
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:50,799
uh our decision at that time was

3630
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:53,599
uh that we

3631
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:56,079
were unable to submit a compliant plan

3632
02:17:53,599 --> 02:18:00,478
to usda

3633
02:17:56,079 --> 02:18:03,280
which sets the stage for usda to be

3634
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:06,159
the regulatory authority for hemp here

3635
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:10,559
in new york state

3636
02:18:06,159 --> 02:18:12,159
um the authority of the 2014 farm bill

3637
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:14,879
uh which is what we're operating on

3638
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:15,519
right now uh you all know expires on 10

3639
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:18,638
31

3640
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:22,000
2020. it's our intention to

3641
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:22,638
run a 2014 compliant program up until

3642
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,359
that

3643
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:30,079
uh sunsets in october of this year's

3644
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:31,359
of this year excuse me that federal

3645
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:33,920
interim rule

3646
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:36,479
uh has many aspects that are uh

3647
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:39,679
inconsistent with what we believe the

3648
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:40,558
congressional intent was uh when the

3649
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,799
2018

3650
02:18:40,558 --> 02:18:44,318
farm bill was passed we think that

3651
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:47,279
intent was

3652
02:18:44,318 --> 02:18:49,439
uh in line with what our beliefs here in

3653
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:50,239
new york have been which is to consider

3654
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:52,960
that

3655
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:53,760
industrial hemp is an agricultural

3656
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:57,199
commodity

3657
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:59,200
and uh that the farm bill was really to

3658
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:02,000
you know continue to stimulate and

3659
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:03,920
develop the industry

3660
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,398
some of the things that we found uh

3661
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:08,239
particularly difficult to deal with

3662
02:19:06,398 --> 02:19:09,840
were the testing requirements and the

3663
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:12,239
destruction requirements

3664
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:13,599
there's a number of other other issues

3665
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:15,679
that we and

3666
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:17,599
others including growers in new york and

3667
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:20,879
other states

3668
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:23,840
have identified that are problematic

3669
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:25,598
we feel that the interpretation of this

3670
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:28,239
section of the farm bill and the

3671
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:29,679
corresponding sections of the federal

3672
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:33,119
interim rule

3673
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:35,679
uh really show that they've been

3674
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:39,359
most likely heavily influenced by

3675
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:41,519
department of justice in the dea

3676
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:45,040
had a number of conversations over the

3677
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:47,760
past several months with usda

3678
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:48,160
regarding what the legal boundaries are

3679
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:52,000
for

3680
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:55,359
a state hemp program

3681
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,040
and what could or would be approved in a

3682
02:19:55,359 --> 02:20:00,880
hemp plan and what the required

3683
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:00,880
regulatory activities would be

3684
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:05,519
in the final analysis uh the components

3685
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:07,120
of an approved state plan are

3686
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:09,200
essentially the same as federal

3687
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:11,120
oversight of the program

3688
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:12,800
in short the rules are the same after

3689
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:14,640
1031 whether

3690
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:16,559
the state or the federal government is

3691
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:21,920
the primary authority

3692
02:20:16,559 --> 02:20:21,920
and states that that sign on for

3693
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:25,760
being the primary regulatory authority

3694
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:29,520
are really

3695
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:30,318
operating as agents if you will of the

3696
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,920
federal

3697
02:20:30,318 --> 02:20:34,639
government our feeling is that

3698
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:36,960
submission of a compliant plan

3699
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:38,799
really uh is an affirmation that the

3700
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:40,959
state agrees with the federal interim

3701
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:42,398
rule and it certainly legally obligates

3702
02:20:40,959 --> 02:20:46,318
us to carry out the plan

3703
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:46,879
is submitted um submitting a compliant

3704
02:20:46,318 --> 02:20:50,000
plan

3705
02:20:46,879 --> 02:20:52,799
with the intent of of not

3706
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:55,280
following it really is is uh in our

3707
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:57,679
opinion a disingenuous act

3708
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:59,040
um and we think that by not submitting a

3709
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:02,000
plan to usda

3710
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:04,080
new york state is really sending a clear

3711
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:06,639
message to usda

3712
02:21:04,079 --> 02:21:09,359
that the requirements are unworkable and

3713
02:21:06,639 --> 02:21:12,879
unnecessarily burdensome to the states

3714
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:14,720
and the growers uh we feel as though

3715
02:21:12,879 --> 02:21:15,599
there are several states that are on the

3716
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:18,079
cusp of

3717
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:19,760
uh following us in this action of not

3718
02:21:18,079 --> 02:21:24,079
sending in a plan

3719
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:26,239
and uh not at liberty right now to

3720
02:21:24,079 --> 02:21:28,239
to name particular states that are

3721
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:31,199
considering this we need to

3722
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:33,600
uh respect their sovereignty and respect

3723
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:35,280
their decision-making process in that

3724
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,439
but we do believe that you'll see some

3725
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,960
other states that that take this action

3726
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:42,960
as well going forward

3727
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:45,039
i want to transition a little bit to the

3728
02:21:42,959 --> 02:21:46,719
letters that we sent to usda

3729
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:48,640
as well as the ones that we sent out to

3730
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:50,799
our research partners

3731
02:21:48,639 --> 02:21:53,519
they both letters reference our strong

3732
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:55,840
commitment to hemp and new york state

3733
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,560
we as a department as an agency and i

3734
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,040
think

3735
02:21:56,559 --> 02:22:00,879
as a state government we're all still

3736
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:03,359
very much committed to hemp

3737
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:05,839
as well as as its economic potential for

3738
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:08,559
new york farmers

3739
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:10,398
i was very interested to see and hear

3740
02:22:08,559 --> 02:22:14,478
the economic analysis

3741
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:17,599
that john hanchar and uh lindsay and

3742
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:20,559
mary presented earlier here today

3743
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:22,239
um and i saw some of the comments in the

3744
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:25,279
in the chat box

3745
02:22:22,239 --> 02:22:28,318
uh i think it's uh i think

3746
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:30,079
the uh this industry is is having

3747
02:22:28,318 --> 02:22:31,680
growing pains clearly

3748
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:33,840
but it still clearly has a lot of

3749
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,398
potential for new york producers as well

3750
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:39,600
as others

3751
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:41,039
um so where are we right now so

3752
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:42,720
getting back to our commitment to

3753
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,640
growers we uh

3754
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:46,398
you know stand ready to assist our hemp

3755
02:22:44,639 --> 02:22:48,719
growers with the transition to

3756
02:22:46,398 --> 02:22:50,559
federal licensing structure we want to

3757
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:54,000
have that be in the most

3758
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:54,719
uh seamless and orderly way possible

3759
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,478
we're going to do

3760
02:22:54,719 --> 02:22:58,000
everything in our control to make this

3761
02:22:56,478 --> 02:23:00,639
happen

3762
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:02,799
one thing that i think is is really been

3763
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:04,478
a fantastic thing about the hemp program

3764
02:23:02,799 --> 02:23:06,398
here in new york and i think in

3765
02:23:04,478 --> 02:23:08,799
other parts of the country and it's a

3766
02:23:06,398 --> 02:23:10,680
and it's a real positive thing

3767
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:12,398
is the enthusiasm and the

3768
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:15,520
entrepreneurship

3769
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:17,840
um and what we've seen in new york is uh

3770
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:19,520
that enthusiasm and entrepreneurship

3771
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:23,120
really

3772
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:26,560
has led to a lot of um

3773
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:27,840
you know specific nuances in your

3774
02:23:26,559 --> 02:23:31,359
business

3775
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:34,239
um you know that's a great thing that

3776
02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:36,399
some of those nuances perhaps uh

3777
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:39,680
complicate the transition

3778
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:41,760
over to the usda program but we are

3779
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:44,720
certainly going to

3780
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:45,359
work with you to get you into that

3781
02:23:44,719 --> 02:23:48,719
program

3782
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:52,000
in the best way possible with the

3783
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:55,279
least legal and

3784
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:57,200
financial risk we're going to also

3785
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:59,120
continue to advocate for adjustments in

3786
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:00,000
the federal program in a more flexible

3787
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:02,479
regulatory

3788
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,478
structure

3789
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:06,720
so a couple things uh just to talk a

3790
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:09,200
little bit about

3791
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:11,279
some general information with the

3792
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:14,079
transition over to

3793
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:14,399
the federal side of things one thing

3794
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:16,478
that

3795
02:24:14,398 --> 02:24:17,760
again is a really positive is that

3796
02:24:16,478 --> 02:24:21,039
actually one of our staff

3797
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:24,079
people here at the department uh

3798
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:27,120
took a position with the usda program

3799
02:24:24,079 --> 02:24:29,280
and so we have really a very strong

3800
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:31,760
relationship with the folks at ams

3801
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:33,520
because of that and we also have a

3802
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:36,800
really good communications with

3803
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:39,920
the folks at ams uh because of that

3804
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:42,239
connection with our former staff person

3805
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:45,040
so we've had some initial conversations

3806
02:24:42,239 --> 02:24:47,600
about what we think this looks like

3807
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,280
um so just a couple of general things

3808
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:51,120
that we're working on and again

3809
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:52,800
there are a lot of specific questions

3810
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:56,240
that need to be answered

3811
02:24:52,799 --> 02:24:57,119
and um we're going to work through those

3812
02:24:56,239 --> 02:25:00,079
over the next

3813
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:02,160
uh weeks to help you out but just a

3814
02:25:00,079 --> 02:25:03,520
typical field grower as we've had the

3815
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:06,559
conversation

3816
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:08,960
with usda that typical field grower

3817
02:25:06,559 --> 02:25:10,079
should probably plan on having their

3818
02:25:08,959 --> 02:25:14,000
harvest complete

3819
02:25:10,079 --> 02:25:17,120
by by the end of the 2014

3820
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,159
farm bill authority and then

3821
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:22,160
proceed to register with the usda

3822
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:23,359
once you're registered with the usda

3823
02:25:22,159 --> 02:25:25,119
you're going to be subject to the

3824
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:27,040
federal requirements

3825
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:29,120
our understanding is is that you cannot

3826
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:32,560
have the federal license and the state

3827
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:34,079
registration at the same time

3828
02:25:32,559 --> 02:25:36,000
you also want to have all of your

3829
02:25:34,079 --> 02:25:41,120
testing of the current year's crop

3830
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,120
done and in hand before that happens

3831
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,040
so the complicating factors are going to

3832
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:47,120
be places that uh

3833
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:50,640
are growing plants for planting or

3834
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:52,240
perhaps that have their plants

3835
02:25:50,639 --> 02:25:55,358
in greenhouses and we're going to work

3836
02:25:52,239 --> 02:26:01,199
closely with those folks

3837
02:25:55,359 --> 02:26:03,439
um couple things on sampling so the usda

3838
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:05,520
program does not require the sampler or

3839
02:26:03,439 --> 02:26:07,280
the lab at this point to be dea

3840
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:08,880
registered at this time i think in the

3841
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:10,960
original version

3842
02:26:08,879 --> 02:26:12,239
of the interim rule they did have that

3843
02:26:10,959 --> 02:26:14,159
requirement

3844
02:26:12,239 --> 02:26:16,000
uh we think this potentially creates

3845
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:17,680
some opportunity for some service

3846
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,120
providers in the state

3847
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,359
whether they be soil and water

3848
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:24,319
conservation folks or certified crop

3849
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:27,520
advisors or perhaps organic certifiers

3850
02:26:24,318 --> 02:26:29,279
to help out with the sampling

3851
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:31,040
requirements and we're told that there

3852
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:35,439
are some good training resources for

3853
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:37,840
potential samplers on the usda website

3854
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:40,000
a little bit here quickly on the federal

3855
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:41,760
application process and reporting under

3856
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,478
the federal program

3857
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:45,680
uh the first step in the federal process

3858
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:48,719
is going to be

3859
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:49,680
to get your fbi background check you

3860
02:26:48,719 --> 02:26:52,478
have to have that

3861
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:54,800
in hand at the time of application it

3862
02:26:52,478 --> 02:26:57,438
can be no older than 60 days old when

3863
02:26:54,799 --> 02:27:00,478
it's submitted to the usda

3864
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:03,120
um i'm told that usda

3865
02:27:00,478 --> 02:27:04,318
is having some interactions with new

3866
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:07,280
york growers that

3867
02:27:04,318 --> 02:27:08,799
uh some of the issues around the postal

3868
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:11,920
service right now

3869
02:27:08,799 --> 02:27:12,559
um are creating a little bit of a a

3870
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:14,318
delay

3871
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:16,478
in background checks there is a

3872
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:18,959
web-based service

3873
02:27:16,478 --> 02:27:19,679
that can do a background check which is

3874
02:27:18,959 --> 02:27:21,519
a

3875
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:23,280
i'm told more expensive i think it's

3876
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:24,239
fifty dollars rather than eighteen

3877
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:26,319
dollars

3878
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:29,520
but we'll try to get that information

3879
02:27:26,318 --> 02:27:31,279
linked up on our website soon

3880
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,040
once you've got the apple or the

3881
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:35,439
background check and plan

3882
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:36,560
in hand i should say you would fill out

3883
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:40,000
your

3884
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:42,879
application it's a one-pager there is no

3885
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:47,040
fee associated with that application

3886
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:49,438
uh it would get submitted to usda

3887
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:50,399
and we're in conversations with usda

3888
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:52,639
about

3889
02:27:50,398 --> 02:27:53,840
whether those applications should become

3890
02:27:52,639 --> 02:27:56,239
coming in right now

3891
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:58,159
or whether they should be held until

3892
02:27:56,239 --> 02:28:01,280
november 1st

3893
02:27:58,159 --> 02:28:04,719
one of the things that that is a

3894
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:06,560
factor in this is as other states

3895
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:08,559
make a similar decision to what the

3896
02:28:06,559 --> 02:28:11,199
decision that we made here

3897
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:12,559
uh their licensing volume is going to

3898
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:14,640
increase

3899
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:17,199
either way what we think will happen is

3900
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:19,119
that the licenses on the federal side

3901
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:22,000
will be issued with an effective date of

3902
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:24,880
november 1st 2020.

3903
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,959
so once the license is reviewed or the

3904
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:27,920
application is reviewed on the federal

3905
02:28:26,959 --> 02:28:30,559
side the app

3906
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:32,239
successful applicant is going to receive

3907
02:28:30,559 --> 02:28:34,879
the license document

3908
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:36,159
and then you would need to go to the

3909
02:28:34,879 --> 02:28:39,199
local usda

3910
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:42,879
fsa service center to

3911
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:45,920
register your uh specific

3912
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:47,279
production locations i'm told that that

3913
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:50,318
information

3914
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:54,399
uh is going to then be shared

3915
02:28:50,318 --> 02:28:58,079
with uh law enforcement authorities

3916
02:28:54,398 --> 02:29:01,760
um you know my experience with fsa

3917
02:28:58,079 --> 02:29:05,200
is that they have very robust gis

3918
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:07,760
capabilities and so that may

3919
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:09,200
actually result in some better

3920
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:13,520
communication

3921
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:16,640
with um with law enforcement

3922
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:17,680
so a couple things where we'll still be

3923
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:21,199
involved

3924
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:24,559
here uh at ag markets certainly

3925
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:25,680
um we still see a very strong role for

3926
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:28,879
us here

3927
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:30,720
around uh the issues around seed quality

3928
02:29:28,879 --> 02:29:33,279
seed certification

3929
02:29:30,719 --> 02:29:34,879
um you know we've talked quite a bit

3930
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:38,399
with some of the seed suppliers

3931
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:39,279
about being in compliance with the seed

3932
02:29:38,398 --> 02:29:42,159
laws

3933
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:43,680
we'll also be working continue continue

3934
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:44,239
to work on plant health and plant

3935
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,720
quality

3936
02:29:44,239 --> 02:29:47,280
issues if you're a producer who is

3937
02:29:46,719 --> 02:29:50,478
selling

3938
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:51,680
hemp transplants to other entities you

3939
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:54,879
would continue to

3940
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:56,960
maintain your nursery grower

3941
02:29:54,879 --> 02:29:58,000
registration with us you would continue

3942
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:01,199
to have

3943
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:03,760
an inspection uh once per two year

3944
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:06,399
licensing cycle

3945
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:08,079
you know to document the the health of

3946
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:10,239
the plant material coming out of your

3947
02:30:08,079 --> 02:30:12,719
operation

3948
02:30:10,239 --> 02:30:14,318
so uh we still have a long list of

3949
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:16,159
questions to answer

3950
02:30:14,318 --> 02:30:18,318
again i want to reaffirm the commitment

3951

02:30:52,559 --> 02:30:57,279

4006
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:24,880
chris was saying

4007
02:32:22,318 --> 02:32:26,239
this has been absolutely phenomenal uh

4008
02:32:24,879 --> 02:32:28,239
presentation this morning

4009
02:32:26,239 --> 02:32:30,000
learned so much and so thank you to

4010
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:32,159
larry for for inviting us and

4011
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,318
allowing us to kind of give an update on

4012
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:37,359
on the the cannabinoid hemp program

4013
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:38,799
here um unfortunately uh we were hoping

4014
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:39,920
that the regulations were going to be

4015
02:32:38,799 --> 02:32:41,519
out by now

4016
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:43,439
so uh we could kind of get a little bit

4017
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:44,960
more into the meat and potatoes of what

4018
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:47,040
the program will look like

4019
02:32:44,959 --> 02:32:48,079
but uh we are being told that they're at

4020
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:50,640
the last stage

4021
02:32:48,079 --> 02:32:52,879
of approval so we're hoping they'll be

4022
02:32:50,639 --> 02:32:54,000
out within the next couple weeks here

4023
02:32:52,879 --> 02:32:56,000
which will kind of give a clearer

4024
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,559
picture of everything that

4025
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,120
will be in the program um i also want to

4026
02:32:58,559 --> 02:33:01,039
highlight

4027
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:03,280
that uh there's a public comment period

4028
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:06,319
associated with those regulations

4029
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:07,840
so um you know you guys are obviously

4030
02:33:06,318 --> 02:33:10,000
you know involved in the industry

4031
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:12,079
studying the industry experts and hemp

4032
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,439
and and uh what's kind of the cutting

4033
02:33:12,079 --> 02:33:15,439
edge movement now

4034
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:16,720
and we definitely encourage encourage

4035
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:18,800
you guys to submit comments

4036
02:33:16,719 --> 02:33:20,559
because uh you know we're not gonna get

4037
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:23,279
everything right the the first time

4038
02:33:20,559 --> 02:33:24,318
and uh viewing this more as a

4039
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,399
partnership

4040
02:33:24,318 --> 02:33:28,159
will definitely help us help us make the

4041
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:31,279
best you know cannabinoid hemp program

4042
02:33:28,159 --> 02:33:33,200
we can um and i think we're up to now

4043
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,680
what 16 different states

4044
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:38,079
that have their own unique kind of uh

4045
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:38,800
cannabinoid hemp or cbd regulations out

4046
02:33:38,079 --> 02:33:42,159
there

4047
02:33:38,799 --> 02:33:45,119
so it really is a rapidly developing

4048
02:33:42,159 --> 02:33:46,799
regulatory framework right now there's a

4049
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:48,479
patchwork of different states

4050
02:33:46,799 --> 02:33:49,599
and we borrowed a little bit from others

4051
02:33:48,478 --> 02:33:51,358
we borrowed a little bit from the

4052
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:52,880
dietary supplement industry from the

4053
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:55,120
food regulations

4054
02:33:52,879 --> 02:33:56,318
and uh we're hoping hoping just to make

4055
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:59,359
something that works

4056
02:33:56,318 --> 02:34:01,199
and is flexible so

4057
02:33:59,359 --> 02:34:02,399
getting started uh today just want to

4058
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,760
talk a little bit about the

4059
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:06,318
legislative background kind of the

4060
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:09,120
history of how how the bill came to pass

4061
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:10,398
and um why it was kind of placed at the

4062
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:13,439
at the department of health

4063
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:14,959
medical marijuana program and we'll go

4064
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:16,800
over the program objectives

4065
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:18,318
for what we're trying to accomplish here

4066
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:20,239
a brief description of the different

4067
02:34:18,318 --> 02:34:21,519
license types between processors and

4068
02:34:20,239 --> 02:34:23,520
retailers

4069
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:25,520
um look at the product standards that

4070
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:25,840
we're trying to trying to hold these two

4071
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:27,600
and

4072
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,880
really those are really building off of

4073
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,520
the great work that ag

4074
02:34:28,879 --> 02:34:32,478
markets has already done and then a

4075
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:34,960
quick timeline

4076
02:34:32,478 --> 02:34:36,639
and next steps so we can kind of

4077
02:34:34,959 --> 02:34:39,519
telegraph what the next three to six

4078
02:34:36,639 --> 02:34:41,358
months will look like

4079
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:43,280
so as many of you are probably aware a

4080
02:34:41,359 --> 02:34:44,000
bill passed in in early 2020

4081
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:47,040
establishing

4082
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:49,200
a hemp program in new york state and as

4083
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:50,399
uh chris just just mentioned in the last

4084
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:53,040
uh segment there

4085
02:34:50,398 --> 02:34:54,398
uh the usda will actually be the uh

4086
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:57,600
regulating cultivation

4087
02:34:54,398 --> 02:34:58,079
for the 2021 uh grow season due to kind

4088
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:59,920
of

4089
02:34:58,079 --> 02:35:01,520
the cumbersome requirements with the

4090
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:04,159
interim final rule

4091
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:05,280
and then the processing and retailing of

4092
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:07,039
cannabinoid hemp

4093
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:08,319
will be going over to the department of

4094
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:10,960
health

4095
02:35:08,318 --> 02:35:12,799
now uh it was really placed there to

4096
02:35:10,959 --> 02:35:14,799
kind of build off the expertise

4097
02:35:12,799 --> 02:35:16,639
that had been developed from regulating

4098
02:35:14,799 --> 02:35:18,799
the medical marijuana program

4099
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:20,879
there's a lot of synergies in terms of

4100
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:22,559
how the plant is extracted

4101
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:24,719
packaging labeling requirements

4102
02:35:22,559 --> 02:35:27,359
manufacturing requirements

4103
02:35:24,719 --> 02:35:28,478
testing so we figured it would be a good

4104
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:30,000
place to kind of

4105
02:35:28,478 --> 02:35:32,318
merge and you know always thinking about

4106
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,719
the taxpayer uh sharing some resources

4107
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:35,760
here

4108
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:38,879
so we can can um

4109
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:39,200
get a get a good head start and i want

4110
02:35:38,879 --> 02:35:41,679
to

4111
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:43,280
uh highlight this first sub bullet here

4112
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:45,520
about the transition from a research

4113
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:48,079
program to a traditional license program

4114
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:49,680
because it it is really significant um

4115
02:35:48,079 --> 02:35:51,680
when again markets first developed their

4116
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:53,680
program back in 2015

4117
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,600
it was really you know focused on what

4118
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:58,639
we heard today in research

4119
02:35:55,600 --> 02:36:00,318
and then all of a sudden cbd exploded

4120
02:35:58,639 --> 02:36:02,799
and everyone wanted to grow it everyone

4121
02:36:00,318 --> 02:36:04,000
wanted to process it and it became much

4122
02:36:02,799 --> 02:36:05,478
more about the

4123
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:07,439
the marketability in the

4124
02:36:05,478 --> 02:36:10,079
commercialization aspects

4125
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:11,520
of of hemp which which is great but

4126
02:36:10,079 --> 02:36:12,000
under a research program you're kind of

4127
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:14,159
limited

4128
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,760
in in the sort of uh relationship

4129
02:36:14,159 --> 02:36:19,119
between the regulator

4130
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:20,719
and the licensee so so uh under this new

4131
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,359
framework we're hoping that we can

4132
02:36:20,719 --> 02:36:23,358
really uh

4133
02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:25,600
grow and help develop the hemp industry

4134
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:26,880
in new york state

4135
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:28,880
so what are we talking about uh

4136
02:36:26,879 --> 02:36:30,719
cannabinoid hemp um

4137
02:36:28,879 --> 02:36:32,799
hemp is defined as any product that is

4138
02:36:30,719 --> 02:36:35,599
used for its cannabinoid content for

4139
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:38,799
human consumption or topical application

4140
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:41,920
so hemp seed oil hemp protein powder

4141
02:36:38,799 --> 02:36:43,679
uh those are you know gris they're

4142
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:45,520
regulated as food they would still be

4143
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:48,720
under egg and markets purview

4144
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:51,680
um and industrial applications

4145
02:36:48,719 --> 02:36:53,119
and you know bioplastics textiles that's

4146
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:53,600
not part of the scope of the program

4147
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:55,680
either

4148
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:57,359
we're really focused on things that are

4149
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:58,880
being sold for their cannabinoid content

4150
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:01,200
and being you know ingested in the human

4151
02:36:58,879 --> 02:37:03,279
body or applied to the skin

4152
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:04,720
um and also want to highlight that it

4153
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,520
was a conscious choice to use

4154
02:37:04,719 --> 02:37:08,079
cannabinoid

4155
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:09,359
rather than calling it the cpd program

4156
02:37:08,079 --> 02:37:10,799
you know i think

4157
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:12,720
we heard from the panels this morning

4158
02:37:10,799 --> 02:37:15,759
you know cbg is getting big

4159
02:37:12,719 --> 02:37:19,599
uh terpenes and those come up

4160
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:20,079
daily uh i'm not going to comment on it

4161
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:21,359
but we're

4162
02:37:20,079 --> 02:37:24,239
getting or i'm seeing a bunch of

4163
02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:27,920
articles about delta 8 thc

4164
02:37:24,239 --> 02:37:28,719
and uh what the 2004 18 farm bill might

4165
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:31,280
have done to

4166
02:37:28,719 --> 02:37:32,000
impact that so um it's always

4167
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:35,600
interesting

4168
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,600
to be involved in this industry

4169
02:37:36,239 --> 02:37:39,680
so what we're really trying to do here

4170
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,079
at the department of health in terms of

4171
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:44,079
objectives is is the first one here is

4172
02:37:42,079 --> 02:37:45,680
we just want to comprehensively regulate

4173
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:46,398
cannabinoid hemp products in new york

4174
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:48,479
state

4175
02:37:46,398 --> 02:37:49,760
so when we were drafting the regulations

4176
02:37:48,478 --> 02:37:51,279
and we were talking with people in the

4177
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:54,079
industry or just people

4178
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:55,280
kind of in new york state there's so

4179
02:37:54,079 --> 02:37:57,520
much ambiguity

4180
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:58,720
right now and because of the lack of

4181
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:01,040
federal guidance

4182
02:37:58,719 --> 02:38:02,719
that some of the most common questions

4183
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,600
are just like what's allowed and what's

4184
02:38:02,719 --> 02:38:05,679
not allowed

4185
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:07,359
so that's definitely one of the main

4186
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:08,800
main focuses of the program is just

4187
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:11,600
trying to provide a clear

4188
02:38:08,799 --> 02:38:13,279
baseline of what will be allowed in new

4189
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:14,960
york state

4190
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,880
the second bullet point here is

4191
02:38:14,959 --> 02:38:18,398
definitely a huge pillar especially for

4192
02:38:16,879 --> 02:38:21,358
us at the department of health

4193
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:22,879
um you know consumer protection and

4194
02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:25,359
quality control standards

4195
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:26,719
are a huge huge aspect of the program we

4196
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:28,479
want to make sure that

4197
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:30,478
products on the shelf have been tested

4198
02:38:28,478 --> 02:38:31,519
are labeled properly and manufactured to

4199
02:38:30,478 --> 02:38:34,239
a certain standard

4200
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:34,880
and give and give consumers some

4201
02:38:34,239 --> 02:38:36,879
assurance

4202
02:38:34,879 --> 02:38:37,920
that when they're buying something it

4203
02:38:36,879 --> 02:38:39,920
actually contains

4204
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:41,520
cannabinoids they're not getting ripped

4205
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:43,439
off and and they have you know the

4206
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:45,520
appropriate warnings or disclosures of

4207
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:47,520
what's in the bottle

4208
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:48,960
and kind of tied into that is is this

4209
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:50,000
last point about education and

4210
02:38:48,959 --> 02:38:52,079
enforcement

4211
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,520
so we we definitely understand that you

4212
02:38:52,079 --> 02:38:54,000
know you can have the best rules in the

4213
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:56,079
world

4214
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,359
but if people aren't following them or

4215
02:38:56,079 --> 02:39:00,559
they're not being uh

4216
02:38:57,359 --> 02:39:01,200
enforced it doesn't really matter so uh

4217
02:39:00,559 --> 02:39:02,719
education

4218
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:04,560
enforcement are going to be a really key

4219
02:39:02,719 --> 02:39:07,199
pillar of the program and

4220
02:39:04,559 --> 02:39:08,318
um we're small now but we're hoping that

4221
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:10,560
we can ramp up

4222
02:39:08,318 --> 02:39:12,398
in terms of resources over the next few

4223
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:16,559
years and dedicate a lot of a lot of

4224
02:39:12,398 --> 02:39:16,559
a lot of those resources to that effort

4225
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:20,800
so a quick overview of the license types

4226
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:22,720
in the new program

4227
02:39:20,799 --> 02:39:24,000
we split the processor into two

4228
02:39:22,719 --> 02:39:26,398
different licenses so

4229
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,120
there's the extraction and manufacturing

4230
02:39:26,398 --> 02:39:29,519
license

4231
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:31,200
and then the manufacturing only license

4232
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:33,600
uh the the key difference here

4233
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:34,560
is really um the extractor license

4234
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:35,520
because

4235
02:39:34,559 --> 02:39:37,680
you know you're using different

4236
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:39,120
equipment and different technologies

4237
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:41,280
and there's a different level of risk

4238
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:41,760
for extraction that that is going to be

4239
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:44,239
its own

4240
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:46,159
kind of a license type assuming that not

4241
02:39:44,239 --> 02:39:48,079
every business will want to do that

4242
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:51,039
and then the manufacturing only license

4243
02:39:48,079 --> 02:39:52,719
will be businesses who are purchasing

4244
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,720
kind of that intermediary product that's

4245
02:39:52,719 --> 02:39:55,438
already been extracted so your isolates

4246
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:57,279
distillates

4247
02:39:55,439 --> 02:39:59,040
whole plant extracts and then

4248
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:01,680
manufacturing a product from there

4249
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:02,720
so really just the idea there was just

4250
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:05,359
allowing different

4251
02:40:02,719 --> 02:40:06,639
opportunities for businesses to to enter

4252
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:09,680
enter the supply chain

4253
02:40:06,639 --> 02:40:12,000
uh based on their business model

4254
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:13,279
and the last uh license here is the hemp

4255
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,040
retailer license

4256
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:17,439
um our idea here is really to make it

4257
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:19,680
more of a permit or a registration

4258
02:40:17,439 --> 02:40:21,120
this is just a way for the department to

4259
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:22,880
kind of get some insight into where

4260
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:24,960
these products are being sold

4261
02:40:22,879 --> 02:40:26,559
um and then also gets our foot in the

4262
02:40:24,959 --> 02:40:28,478
door so we can start educating these

4263
02:40:26,559 --> 02:40:30,318
retailers about you know how to source

4264
02:40:28,478 --> 02:40:31,760
a quality cannabinoid hemp product what

4265
02:40:30,318 --> 02:40:32,239
to look for on the label has it been

4266
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:34,639
tested

4267
02:40:32,239 --> 02:40:35,439
does it say how many milligrams of cbd

4268
02:40:34,639 --> 02:40:37,519
are in it

4269
02:40:35,439 --> 02:40:39,279
and uh from there you know we'll have a

4270
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:40,640
piece of paper that says

4271
02:40:39,279 --> 02:40:42,800
well you agreed that you were going to

4272
02:40:40,639 --> 02:40:44,478
check for the x y and z and you're not

4273
02:40:42,799 --> 02:40:46,719
so that'll kind of help us on the

4274
02:40:44,478 --> 02:40:48,639
enforcement side as well

4275
02:40:46,719 --> 02:40:51,119
and again you know there's potentially

4276
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:53,599
10 000 uh places in new york state

4277
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:54,160
that could be selling uh cannabinoid

4278
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:57,279
products

4279
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:57,279
uh within the first year

4280
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:01,520
so uh the product standards for for

4281
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,478
those of you who are research

4282
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:06,159
partnership research partners in the ag

4283
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:07,760
markets program right now

4284
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:09,439
a lot of these bullet points should look

4285
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:11,200
really familiar

4286
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,720
thank you chris for for creating a great

4287
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:14,720
program over there we we

4288
02:41:12,719 --> 02:41:16,879
plagiarized copied and stole a lot of

4289
02:41:14,719 --> 02:41:19,599
good ideas from that program

4290
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:20,000
so uh in regards to manufacturing um you

4291
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,000
know

4292
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,359
we don't want to reinvent the wheel here

4293
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,398
uh there's already

4294
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:28,318
uh good regulations out there in terms

4295
02:41:26,398 --> 02:41:30,239
of good manufacturing processes for both

4296
02:41:28,318 --> 02:41:32,398
food and dietary supplements

4297
02:41:30,239 --> 02:41:33,279
and we kind of want to build off that as

4298
02:41:32,398 --> 02:41:36,159
a foundation

4299
02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:37,359
and then layer on those additional um

4300
02:41:36,159 --> 02:41:40,000
concerns

4301
02:41:37,359 --> 02:41:41,359
uh that are unique to cannabis so uh

4302
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,318
packaging and labeling is a great

4303
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:44,800
example

4304
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:45,439
um because this is such a new industry

4305
02:41:44,799 --> 02:41:47,199
um

4306
02:41:45,439 --> 02:41:48,800
it's all about consumer awareness we

4307
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:50,560
want to make sure the consumer

4308
02:41:48,799 --> 02:41:51,920
knows what they're putting in their body

4309
02:41:50,559 --> 02:41:54,799
how much they're they're

4310
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:56,159
uh consuming uh there's a qr code so

4311
02:41:54,799 --> 02:41:57,840
they can they can check that

4312
02:41:56,159 --> 02:41:59,600
the product has been tested it's been

4313
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:01,120
labeled and then um

4314
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:02,640
warnings and disclosures are also

4315
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:04,240
extremely important especially when

4316
02:42:02,639 --> 02:42:05,278
you're talking about you know a full

4317
02:42:04,239 --> 02:42:07,199
spectrum product

4318
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:08,399
that could potentially cause someone to

4319
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:09,600
fail a drug test

4320
02:42:08,398 --> 02:42:10,959
you want to be upfront about that

4321
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:12,159
information because that could affect

4322
02:42:10,959 --> 02:42:14,398
someone's life

4323
02:42:12,159 --> 02:42:15,359
so um we're looking to add things like

4324
02:42:14,398 --> 02:42:19,519
that

4325
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:22,239
uh in regards to laboratory testing um

4326
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:23,600
we're going with the 17025 iso

4327
02:42:22,239 --> 02:42:25,680
accreditation

4328
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:27,279
another a couple other states are also

4329
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:29,920
going with that

4330
02:42:27,279 --> 02:42:31,359
i think it's popular in in the medical

4331
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:33,920
marijuana and adult use

4332
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:36,000
industry as well so we're kind of

4333
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:36,639
building off that and as these programs

4334
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,639
grow

4335
02:42:36,639 --> 02:42:40,079
the quality of the third party lab

4336
02:42:38,639 --> 02:42:42,559
sector should also grow with

4337
02:42:40,079 --> 02:42:43,520
it so that'll be definitely a work in

4338
02:42:42,559 --> 02:42:45,519
progress

4339
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:48,000
um we're requiring a full panel of

4340
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:50,159
testing for cannabinoid hemp products

4341
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:51,760
i mean similar to the medical marijuana

4342
02:42:50,159 --> 02:42:52,879
and the adult use standards

4343
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,200
you know you're still putting it in your

4344
02:42:52,879 --> 02:42:57,920
body so it should be tested for

4345
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,800
you know residual solvents microbials

4346
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:01,439
heavy metals

4347
02:42:58,799 --> 02:43:01,438
etc

4348
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,359
so that really is the the program in a

4349
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:07,520
nutshell um

4350
02:43:05,359 --> 02:43:09,439
i want to highlight again that the

4351
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:10,000
regulations should be out relatively

4352
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:12,159
soon

4353
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:13,600
uh we definitely encourage everyone to

4354
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:14,879
give feedback on them

4355
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:17,359
and i also want to highlight that they

4356
02:43:14,879 --> 02:43:18,799
are proposed regulations so

4357
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:21,279
things will not be written in stone

4358
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:24,478
we'll have opportunities to make changes

4359
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:27,760
and um new licenses should be available

4360
02:43:24,478 --> 02:43:28,159
we're shooting for early 2021 for on the

4361
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:30,559
both

4362
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:32,398
the processor side and the retail side

4363
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:33,840
so please be on the lookout for

4364
02:43:32,398 --> 02:43:35,840
additional information there

4365
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:37,600
uh we're working on setting up a

4366
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:39,520
cannabinoid hemp website

4367
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:40,640
so we can post some of this stuff online

4368
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:42,720
and also setting up

4369
02:43:40,639 --> 02:43:44,239
a call center number so we can we can

4370
02:43:42,719 --> 02:43:45,840
take your calls

4371
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:47,760
we do have a shared email that's on my

4372
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:48,960
next slide i can share that at the end

4373
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:51,760
here

4374
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:53,679
um but quickly the last point here is we

4375
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,239
also are working in tandem with ag

4376
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:56,159
markets

4377
02:43:54,239 --> 02:43:58,719
on the transition of existing research

4378
02:43:56,159 --> 02:44:00,239
partners over to the doh program

4379
02:43:58,719 --> 02:44:01,840
so uh we really want to make that as

4380
02:44:00,239 --> 02:44:03,359
seamless as possible as i already

4381
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:04,318
mentioned a lot of the requirements will

4382
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:06,159
be similar

4383
02:44:04,318 --> 02:44:07,600
so it'll kind of just be working out

4384
02:44:06,159 --> 02:44:09,600
those who are operating those who are

4385
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:12,079
not operating and getting all the

4386
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:14,239
boxes checked on the application to to

4387
02:44:12,079 --> 02:44:16,398
make it as seamless as possible

4388
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:17,760
so once again thank you to cornell for

4389
02:44:16,398 --> 02:44:20,079
letting us give this

4390
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:22,000

to contact us we're more than happy

4392
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:28,959

02:44:25,959 --> 02:44:30,879
health.new york.gov

4394
02:44:28,959 --> 02:44:33,839
and uh thank you i will kick it back to

4395
02:44:30,879 --> 02:44:33,839
larry now

4396
02:44:34,478 --> 02:44:37,840
thanks very much pat uh we're very close

4397
02:44:37,359 --> 02:44:40,479
to

4398
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:42,318
the uh scheduled uh time of completing

4399
02:44:40,478 --> 02:44:46,398
our field day but i want to go another

4400
02:44:42,318 --> 02:44:48,000
15 minutes or so to try to let uh

4401
02:44:46,398 --> 02:44:50,639
mainly you and chris answer some of

4402
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,359
these questions if you can

4403
02:44:50,639 --> 02:44:54,000
uh one of the main questions i've seen

4404
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:57,200
is

4405
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:59,760
how will usda define a

4406
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:01,520
grower or a producer is that the

4407
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:04,000
landowner or

4408
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:04,000
would it be

4409
02:45:04,559 --> 02:45:08,000
someone who's renting the land for

4410
02:45:06,239 --> 02:45:10,559
example chris you have a

4411
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,040
an idea i'm not sure i can answer that

4412
02:45:10,559 --> 02:45:13,278
so

4413
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:14,319
so larry i think my sense is is that

4414
02:45:13,279 --> 02:45:17,200
it's going to be

4415
02:45:14,318 --> 02:45:18,159
very similar to how we defined it um and

4416
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:21,279
again this is

4417
02:45:18,159 --> 02:45:24,079
these are all details that um

4418
02:45:21,279 --> 02:45:25,439
that we need to work through with them

4419
02:45:24,079 --> 02:45:29,520
but my sense is it's

4420
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:32,639
the farmer is registered with them

4421
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:34,479
um and then the locations you know get

4422
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:37,680
registered through farm service

4423
02:45:34,478 --> 02:45:40,840
agency yeah

4424
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:42,000
uh dan is asking who needs to have the

4425
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:45,040
fbi

4426
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,879
uh identity history summary uh

4427
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:48,399
my reading of that was it was the

4428
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:51,679
principles of the firm

4429
02:45:48,398 --> 02:45:54,478
right i would agree with that yep

4430
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:55,040
uh so not necessarily uh all of the

4431
02:45:54,478 --> 02:45:58,079
staff

4432
02:45:55,040 --> 02:46:00,640
or investors and of course at cornell

4433
02:45:58,079 --> 02:46:02,799
university we are in discussion with our

4434
02:46:00,639 --> 02:46:04,639
general counsel because the principal of

4435
02:46:02,799 --> 02:46:07,278
cornell university is our president

4436
02:46:04,639 --> 02:46:09,278
and our board of trustees yep i think we

4437
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:10,079
i think we cross that bridge ourselves

4438
02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:13,200
on that a while

4439
02:46:10,079 --> 02:46:16,239
ago right between state and cornell

4440
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:17,520
so i just got an email from our general

4441
02:46:16,239 --> 02:46:19,039
counsel saying

4442
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:24,479
larry you're gonna apply as an

4443
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:27,279
individual right

4444
02:46:24,478 --> 02:46:28,000
uh another question that has come up

4445
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:30,159
quite a bit

4446
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,600
from pat and we get this question quite

4447
02:46:30,159 --> 02:46:34,000
a bit is uh

4448
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:35,840
will department of health be regulating

4449
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:38,239
uh smokable flour

4450
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:39,040
how what will the regulation of that

4451
02:46:38,239 --> 02:46:42,559
look like

4452
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:44,319
under the doh program yeah so i

4453
02:46:42,559 --> 02:46:45,600
i will make the caveat that our

4454
02:46:44,318 --> 02:46:47,439
regulations are not

4455
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,279
are not final yet so this is all subject

4456
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:51,200
to change and even when they're posted

4457
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:52,399
they're still subject to change but at

4458
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,800
the time we are we are

4459
02:46:52,398 --> 02:46:55,519
uh looking for a pathway to allow flower

4460
02:46:54,799 --> 02:46:58,559
however

4461
02:46:55,520 --> 02:47:01,120
um we are going to restrict the

4462
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:02,159
the uh forms that can be sold so no

4463
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:04,880
pre-rolls

4464
02:47:02,159 --> 02:47:06,318
no hemp cigars no cigarettes and that's

4465
02:47:04,879 --> 02:47:08,318
really done from a public health

4466
02:47:06,318 --> 02:47:10,079
perspective to not really encourage the

4467
02:47:08,318 --> 02:47:12,159
combustion of these products

4468
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:14,719
and then recognizing that you know they

4469
02:47:12,159 --> 02:47:17,920
are available in other states and online

4470
02:47:14,719 --> 02:47:20,318
and um there's also other uses

4471
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:22,318
such as amputees and throwing them in

4472
02:47:20,318 --> 02:47:24,879
flour making your own edibles at home

4473
02:47:22,318 --> 02:47:25,760
so uh at this time that is the direction

4474
02:47:24,879 --> 02:47:28,079
we're heading

4475
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:31,120
uh but please be on the lookout for

4476
02:47:28,079 --> 02:47:31,120
those final regulations

4477
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:35,200
another question i think for chris

4478
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:38,000
although maybe not a

4479
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:39,120
division of plant industry question uh

4480
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:41,200
can we extend

4481
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:42,319
our new york grown and certified status

4482
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:45,439
to our hemp crop

4483
02:47:42,318 --> 02:47:48,799
and cannabinoid products so

4484
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:50,880
uh not a plant industry question larry i

4485
02:47:48,799 --> 02:47:53,599
would have to kick that to

4486
02:47:50,879 --> 02:47:53,920
um one of our folks in ag development

4487
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:56,399
and

4488
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:59,279
certainly can uh can try to get an

4489
02:47:56,398 --> 02:47:59,278
answer to that for you

4490
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:08,318
i think i've seen questions regarding

4491
02:48:03,279 --> 02:48:10,640
uh holding material after november 1st

4492
02:48:08,318 --> 02:48:12,079
so will you need to be licensed with

4493
02:48:10,639 --> 02:48:16,000
usda

4494
02:48:12,079 --> 02:48:18,879
to hold let's say dried material

4495
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,760
certainly if you have clones growing in

4496
02:48:18,879 --> 02:48:22,879
your greenhouse

4497
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:25,200
on november 1st as we will have

4498
02:48:22,879 --> 02:48:26,879
we need to have a usda license but what

4499
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:30,000
about

4500
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:33,358
tested harvested material so

4501
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:35,680
we've actually as we've been kind of uh

4502
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:36,720
participating in this webinar today

4503
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:40,159
we've been

4504
02:48:36,719 --> 02:48:42,318
having some uh side conversations with

4505
02:48:40,159 --> 02:48:44,000
usda with some of those questions and

4506
02:48:42,318 --> 02:48:47,680
we're gonna try to get a

4507
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:49,200
firm answer on that um the initial

4508
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:52,318
answer we have on that is

4509
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:55,600
is that anything that is you know

4510
02:48:52,318 --> 02:48:59,439
out of the ground harvested tested

4511
02:48:55,600 --> 02:49:02,640
before october 31st should be to the

4512
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:05,359
uh to the state standard anything

4513
02:49:02,639 --> 02:49:08,559
that you know is still in the ground and

4514
02:49:05,359 --> 02:49:11,200
the testing and such is not completed

4515
02:49:08,559 --> 02:49:12,959
by october 31st goes to the to the

4516
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:15,040
federal standard i think one of the

4517
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:15,358
things that we really need to get a bead

4518
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:18,000
on

4519
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:20,079
larry is you know i know there's some

4520
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:22,478
product out there that has been stored

4521
02:49:20,079 --> 02:49:24,879
for a longer period of time

4522
02:49:22,478 --> 02:49:26,159
that you know folks are are waiting

4523
02:49:24,879 --> 02:49:28,000
frankly for uh

4524
02:49:26,159 --> 02:49:30,318
better market conditions and we need to

4525
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:33,359
get a sense of that because

4526
02:49:30,318 --> 02:49:36,239
i'm not sure uh well

4527
02:49:33,359 --> 02:49:38,800
i know that our former staff person who

4528
02:49:36,239 --> 02:49:41,199
now works for usda understands that

4529
02:49:38,799 --> 02:49:42,318
i'm not sure people higher up the chain

4530
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:44,720
in usda

4531
02:49:42,318 --> 02:49:45,840
have a sense of that so we can work on

4532
02:49:44,719 --> 02:49:49,599
that one

4533
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:51,279
yeah uh pat here's there's a question

4534
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:54,399
can you talk about the application

4535
02:49:51,279 --> 02:49:56,000
process for retailers

4536
02:49:54,398 --> 02:49:58,000
yeah definitely so we're actually we're

4537
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:59,840
in the process now of uh developing an

4538
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:01,760
online application for that

4539
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:04,079
uh trying to make it kind of as easy as

4540
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:05,760
possible it's not meant to be really a

4541
02:50:04,079 --> 02:50:08,239
barrier of entry

4542
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:09,359
and uh is really more of a permit a

4543
02:50:08,239 --> 02:50:12,159
registration

4544
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:13,439
at which uh you can kind of just get an

4545
02:50:12,159 --> 02:50:16,719
idea of where these

4546
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:19,359
places are being sold and then um can

4547
02:50:16,719 --> 02:50:20,959
provide some education to them and

4548
02:50:19,359 --> 02:50:24,880
similar to the processor licenses we're

4549
02:50:20,959 --> 02:50:27,199
hoping to roll that out in early 2021

4550
02:50:24,879 --> 02:50:27,199
great

4551
02:50:29,359 --> 02:50:33,200
there's a question what will the

4552
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:35,760
mechanism of enforcement be

4553
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:37,120
for non-compliant hemp products in new

4554
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:40,159
york state

4555
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:40,160
beginning in 21.

4556
02:50:40,639 --> 02:50:44,079
that's a question for you pat howard how

4557
02:50:42,799 --> 02:50:46,398
is doh

4558
02:50:44,079 --> 02:50:48,000
going to enforce all of these new

4559
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:49,358
regulations

4560
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,639
that's a great question and we are

4561
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,600
definitely working through that now

4562
02:50:50,639 --> 02:50:54,478
right here

4563
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:56,399
um like i said i think the first year

4564
02:50:54,478 --> 02:50:58,639
will really be focused on education

4565
02:50:56,398 --> 02:51:00,639
and trying to get people understanding

4566
02:50:58,639 --> 02:51:02,639
what the new rules and regulations are

4567
02:51:00,639 --> 02:51:04,159
we understand that a lot of these people

4568
02:51:02,639 --> 02:51:06,000
have have product that they've already

4569
02:51:04,159 --> 02:51:07,279
purchased in anticipation you know for

4570
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,439
the next six months

4571
02:51:07,279 --> 02:51:11,200
so uh there will be some some type of

4572
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:12,559
grace period there for stuff that's on

4573
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:14,960
the shelves now

4574
02:51:12,559 --> 02:51:16,559
um and then from there i think it's you

4575
02:51:14,959 --> 02:51:17,278
know we're going to take best practices

4576
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:18,398
from from ag

4577
02:51:17,279 --> 02:51:20,960
markets and what we learned in the

4578
02:51:18,398 --> 02:51:23,039
medical marijuana industry in terms of

4579
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:24,079
uh you know testing products doing

4580
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:25,920
random sampling

4581
02:51:24,079 --> 02:51:27,920
uh secret shopping stuff like that to

4582
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:29,200
kind of make sure that

4583
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:32,239
things are properly labeled and

4584
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:34,479
manufactured yeah

4585
02:51:32,239 --> 02:51:35,520
there have been a lot of comments about

4586
02:51:34,478 --> 02:51:38,559
the

4587
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:41,600
uh federal limits or

4588
02:51:38,559 --> 02:51:43,359
compliance limits for thc uh

4589
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:44,800
folks should know that the national farm

4590
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:49,040
bureau federation

4591
02:51:44,799 --> 02:51:52,478
is lobbying congress for a one percent

4592
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:54,880
total thc limit as well as many of the

4593
02:51:52,478 --> 02:51:55,599
uh hemp industry groups if you are not a

4594
02:51:54,879 --> 02:51:58,799
member

4595
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:02,159
of hemp industry association or other

4596
02:51:58,799 --> 02:52:05,519
uh national hemp uh associations

4597
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:06,719
uh now may be a good time to consider

4598
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:10,319
joining some of those

4599
02:52:06,719 --> 02:52:12,879
uh to because they are they are involved

4600
02:52:10,318 --> 02:52:16,079
in that advocacy

4601
02:52:12,879 --> 02:52:20,000
uh there was a question

4602
02:52:16,079 --> 02:52:20,959
uh chris if folks are only one year into

4603
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,159
their license

4604
02:52:20,959 --> 02:52:26,719
will they get a refund so

4605
02:52:24,159 --> 02:52:27,680
uh that's a great question larry

4606
02:52:26,719 --> 02:52:30,559
unfortunately

4607
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:33,040
you know that that's an application fee

4608
02:52:30,559 --> 02:52:34,639
uh that we had with this program and

4609
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:39,359
and we are not going to be in the

4610
02:52:34,639 --> 02:52:39,358
position to to prorate those licenses

4611
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:44,239
uh so question for pat will existing

4612
02:52:42,398 --> 02:52:46,318
research partner processors be

4613
02:52:44,239 --> 02:52:49,840
grandfathered into the doh

4614
02:52:46,318 --> 02:52:52,879
doh program what would be the transition

4615
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:54,799
for existing license holders

4616
02:52:52,879 --> 02:52:57,278
yes so we've been uh we actually started

4617
02:52:54,799 --> 02:52:58,559
the outreach uh about a month ago

4618
02:52:57,279 --> 02:53:00,319
to kind of do a level set and we're

4619
02:52:58,559 --> 02:53:02,719
working with ag and markets now

4620
02:53:00,318 --> 02:53:04,239
to kind of get a good snapshot of kind

4621
02:53:02,719 --> 02:53:06,478
of where everyone is in the process

4622
02:53:04,239 --> 02:53:07,840
we understand that you know cove really

4623
02:53:06,478 --> 02:53:09,519
threw a wrench into a lot of people

4624
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:11,279
setting up their facilities and getting

4625
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:12,479
all their extraction equipment ready and

4626
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:14,800
stuff like that

4627
02:53:12,478 --> 02:53:16,318
so our goal here at doh is really to

4628
02:53:14,799 --> 02:53:18,478
work with all the research partners

4629
02:53:16,318 --> 02:53:20,079
to help them transition as seamless as

4630
02:53:18,478 --> 02:53:22,879
possible

4631
02:53:20,079 --> 02:53:23,359
everyone will have to apply under a new

4632
02:53:22,879 --> 02:53:25,679
license

4633
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:27,520
because it is a new program but um we're

4634
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:29,600
hoping to really spell that out

4635
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:31,279
and make it make it as easy as possible

4636
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:32,720
to kind of shift over

4637
02:53:31,279 --> 02:53:34,800
so uh you know people who are in

4638
02:53:32,719 --> 02:53:36,318
operation can continue and those who are

4639
02:53:34,799 --> 02:53:37,119
still setting up will understand the new

4640
02:53:36,318 --> 02:53:40,318
requirements

4641
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:42,560
and can hit the ground running

4642
02:53:40,318 --> 02:53:45,439
yeah i think there's a similar question

4643
02:53:42,559 --> 02:53:47,119
for folks who will need to transition

4644
02:53:45,439 --> 02:53:49,279
from the state program to the federal

4645
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:51,040
program when should they start

4646
02:53:49,279 --> 02:53:53,279
we've got just a little bit more than

4647
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:55,520
two months now

4648
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:56,640
i started filling out my application

4649
02:53:55,520 --> 02:54:00,399
this morning

4650
02:53:56,639 --> 02:54:03,278
and looking at the fbi identity history

4651
02:54:00,398 --> 02:54:04,799
summary check there is a big notice here

4652
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:08,079
on the website that

4653
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:09,039
if you submit that via mail the current

4654
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:12,079
processing time

4655
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:15,200
is 12 weeks there is an

4656
02:54:12,079 --> 02:54:17,600
online process that they say will only

4657
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:20,560
take four to five days

4658
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:22,399
but if you are currently a grower and

4659
02:54:20,559 --> 02:54:23,278
will need a grower's license on november

4660
02:54:22,398 --> 02:54:25,519
1st

4661
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:27,200
i would encourage you to get that

4662
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:30,159
paperwork in

4663
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:32,000
quickly so and larry if i can jump in

4664
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:32,879
here real quick on that because i see

4665
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:35,439
those

4666
02:54:32,879 --> 02:54:36,799
those uh questions in the chat as well

4667
02:54:35,439 --> 02:54:39,680
um

4668
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:41,199
we're we're in conversations with usda

4669
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:44,318
on how best to do this

4670
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:47,840
and um you know there's there

4671
02:54:44,318 --> 02:54:51,519
there could be a scenario where

4672
02:54:47,840 --> 02:54:54,639
they hold applications uh

4673
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:56,159
and then uh you know they would if they

4674
02:54:54,639 --> 02:54:58,159
if they were holding them in other words

4675
02:54:56,159 --> 02:54:59,600
if they got my application today they

4676
02:54:58,159 --> 02:55:01,039
would take a look at it

4677
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,720
they would determine whether it was

4678
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:04,640
complete or not

4679
02:55:02,719 --> 02:55:05,920
if it was incomplete they'd return it

4680
02:55:04,639 --> 02:55:08,959
they would then uh

4681
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:11,120
perhaps hold it until the end of october

4682
02:55:08,959 --> 02:55:13,679
issue the registration

4683
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:14,960
with a couple of other states that that

4684
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:18,318
frankly are

4685
02:55:14,959 --> 02:55:19,278
are bigger in hemp production than new

4686
02:55:18,318 --> 02:55:22,000
york

4687
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:24,000
on the cusp of of making similar

4688
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:25,760
decisions that we made

4689
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
they're thinking that they don't want to

4690
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:32,000
get backed up and what they may do

4691
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:34,559
is to um you know start accepting

4692
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,719
uh those applications acting on them and

4693
02:55:34,559 --> 02:55:37,920
actually issuing the license document

4694
02:55:36,719 --> 02:55:40,959
with a november first

4695
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:44,159
effective date so what i would would ask

4696
02:55:40,959 --> 02:55:45,599
is um that folks uh

4697
02:55:44,159 --> 02:55:47,520
allow us to have a little bit more

4698
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:50,720
conversation with usda

4699
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:55,040
and see how they want to handle this

4700
02:55:50,719 --> 02:55:58,959
um you know as a as a administrator who

4701
02:55:55,040 --> 02:56:02,960
who faced the tidal wave of of 2017

4702
02:55:58,959 --> 02:56:06,398
and 2018 uh uh you know i still want to

4703
02:56:02,959 --> 02:56:08,959
maintain a uh respectful and

4704
02:56:06,398 --> 02:56:09,920
collegial relationship with with usda

4705
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:12,318
particularly since

4706
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:13,520
uh you know one of their key staff

4707
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:15,199
people worked for me and

4708
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:16,960
i have a lot of respect for for her

4709
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:20,240
personally as well so

4710
02:56:16,959 --> 02:56:23,278
um so let us work this a little bit

4711
02:56:20,239 --> 02:56:24,959
um i don't see the answers to these

4712
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:27,760
types of questions

4713
02:56:24,959 --> 02:56:28,719
uh as far as timing of applications

4714
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:31,760
taking

4715
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:33,519
particularly long and so if we had even

4716
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:35,359
a week or so to kind of work through

4717
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:37,520
that and then get that information

4718
02:56:35,359 --> 02:56:39,279
up on our website as well as being able

4719
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:42,479
to distribute it through your

4720
02:56:39,279 --> 02:56:45,120
lists i think that would be super yeah

4721
02:56:42,478 --> 02:56:47,599
yeah i will say that uh at a recent

4722
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:50,319
national conference i was involved in

4723
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:52,720
bill hoffman who was running the usda

4724
02:56:50,318 --> 02:56:52,719
program

4725
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:57,040
i would say was conflicted because he

4726
02:56:55,359 --> 02:56:59,600
wants to serve the interest

4727
02:56:57,040 --> 02:57:01,760
interests of the farmers uh but is bound

4728
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:05,120
by the rule-making process

4729
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:08,639
at usda uh so

4730
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:09,359
uh i i hope they will they will maintain

4731
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:11,278
that

4732
02:57:09,359 --> 02:57:12,399
that attitude of keeping the interest of

4733
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:16,319
farmers i

4734
02:57:12,398 --> 02:57:19,840
i have to say despite our

4735
02:57:16,318 --> 02:57:23,519
clear policy differences here bill

4736
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:25,600
is seems to be a very um

4737
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:28,239
you know a very thoughtful person and i

4738
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:30,880
think really wants to see this industry

4739
02:57:28,239 --> 02:57:32,318
grow and uh i think he can be a strong

4740
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:35,438
advocate for it

4741
02:57:32,318 --> 02:57:39,039
but again he's you know i i've con

4742
02:57:35,439 --> 02:57:40,398
i've i've compared his situation to

4743
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:44,560
where we were

4744
02:57:40,398 --> 02:57:47,039
in the state in 2015 and 2016

4745
02:57:44,559 --> 02:57:48,239
when we put our first reg in place which

4746
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:51,520
if you remember had

4747
02:57:48,239 --> 02:57:54,318
the requirements for the security fences

4748
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:54,880
and was going to cost everybody 50 60

4749
02:57:54,318 --> 02:57:57,278
000

4750
02:57:54,879 --> 02:58:01,199
an acre to comply with their you know

4751
02:57:57,279 --> 02:58:01,200
give them some time to work through this

4752
02:58:01,279 --> 02:58:04,960
just a couple of final notes here in the

4753
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:08,510
regulations

4754
02:58:04,959 --> 02:58:10,559
there is an application window to usda

4755
02:58:08,510 --> 02:58:12,960
[Music]

4756
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:13,760
that would close on october 31st so

4757
02:58:12,959 --> 02:58:18,159
again

4758
02:58:13,760 --> 02:58:22,000
get going on your application uh

4759
02:58:18,159 --> 02:58:24,959
and uh there's a comment here that uh

4760
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:26,239
the fbi check did come back quickly i

4761
02:58:24,959 --> 02:58:29,599
think that's if you do it

4762

online uh any final comments

4763
