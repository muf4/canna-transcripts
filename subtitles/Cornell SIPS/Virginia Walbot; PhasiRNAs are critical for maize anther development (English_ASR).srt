1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,859
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,859
University

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,419
well it's always awesome to come come

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:12,519
here because there's so many plant

5
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:14,289
biologists you know I exist in an

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,960
environment where I'm usually talking to

7
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:21,038
people with an MD rather than a pH

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,368
degree so today I'm going to give some

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,770
real botany about maize anthers and then

10
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:29,890
we're going to see how the new class of

11
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:34,179
small RNAs called fazzy rnase influence

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:37,179
anther development so first I want to

13
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:42,549
tell you how to build an anther so in

14
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:46,269
maize there are three floret primordia

15
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:50,319
and these little bumps are going to be

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,570
the stamens and these statement initials

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,929
basically use up most of the meristem

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,270
and there's cells derived from the l1

19
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:01,829
layer of the meristem and from both of

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,509
the l2 layers of monocot meristem and

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,340
there's about a hundred cells at the

22
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:08,920
beginning in each of these statement

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,859
initials and what's really remarkable to

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,039
me is that nine days later at the start

25
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:17,228
of meiosis we've built each anther into

26
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:19,299
this four lobe structure subtended by a

27
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:21,670
filament which contains the vascular

28
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,459
column which proceeds up through the

29
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,939
center of each anther and there's now

30
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,560
about 50,000 cells so the pace of cell

31
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,929
division and anthers is cell division

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,728
about every eight hours which is faster

33
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:37,539
than the million cells in tissue culture

34
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:40,750
and also there's patterning so from

35
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:43,090
these meristem drive letters within each

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:48,579
lobe we end up with an epidermis from

37
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:51,129
the l1 and for cell types from this sub

38
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,719
epidermal layer the endothelium which is

39
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:55,539
colored green because it actually has

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,789
chloroplasts the middle layer of more or

41
00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:01,679
less unknown function the two petal

42
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:04,509
cells which are nutritive cells for the

43
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:06,640
Archos poriyal than pollen mother cells

44
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,340
and Maya sites and later the micro

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,500
gametophyte

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,900
so we need to have a fast pace of cell

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,780
division but the first question we

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,530
really asked was where do the cell types

49
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:24,349
how do you get started

50
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:27,860
making an answer and the old model was

51
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:30,109
that there was a primary large cell

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,230
called the hypodermis cells it is how to

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,320
borrowed from earn reproduction and that

54
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:38,810
this giant layer two cell would divide

55
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,870
to make a somatic cell to the exterior

56
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,629
and anarchist boreal a prebiotic cell to

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,670
the interior and this is actually copied

58
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,319
from my undergraduate botany notes it

59
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:51,139
made no sense to me because the next

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,689
drawing the teacher made was this where

61
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,689
we have a ring of soma around that

62
00:02:53,689 --> 00:03:00,770
central reproductive cell and that just

63
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:02,719
doesn't seem very likely and so rather

64
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,930
than using transverse sections which

65
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,270
everyone had done up to that point we

66
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,659
switch to using confocal microscopy so

67
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,209
we could make a more robust description

68
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:16,879
of what was going on and in the early

69
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,610
anther here's the incipient four lobes

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,340
when you do it by confocal you can never

71
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,590
find the giant cell but in this one

72
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,989
transverse image from the confocal

73
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,629
probably everyone can pick out a cell

74
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,239
that looks bigger but when you actually

75
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:38,000
do all the volumes there is no giant

76
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:41,480
cell instead what happens is there's

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,269
continual division kind of in any plane

78
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:49,459
now we're looking at a longitudinal view

79
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:54,379
of a small anther until their cells that

80
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:57,439
only have l2d neighbors so before that

81
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,109
every l2d cell touched in a presumptive

82
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,969
epidermal cell but this white dot shows

83
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,860
you a cell that is completely surrounded

84
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:11,239
now by l2d cells and that event which

85
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:15,140
you can image in in any view combined

86
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,989
with a specific glute or a dachshund

87
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:20,988
called Miska one and I'll tell you later

88
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:23,750
hypoxia which is transduced through this

89
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:27,829
glute of a dachshund causes cells like

90
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,769
this to greatly enlarge and become the

91
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,300
artists Oriole cells so the first type

92
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,819
of cell that specif

93
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,910
in an anther lobe is actually the pre my

94
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:43,849
OTT Excel the Argos Oriole cell and

95
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:46,880
these cells then secrete a small protein

96
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,879
ligand called Mac wine that causes the

97
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,769
differentiation of the soma so there

98
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,659
isn't a special hypodermis cell at the

99
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,810
beginning there's a sequence of events

100
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:01,730
that results in specification and that

101
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:06,220
process takes approximately a day to

102
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:09,830
make a column of our carcass royal cells

103
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,850
down the length of the anther and this

104
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:16,579
also solves an old question in flowering

105
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,070
plant biology in the hypodermis cell

106
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:21,399
model all of the pollen grains from one

107
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,920
lobe would have had one progenitor cell

108
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:28,370
so in maize at least there's 10 to 12 of

109
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,460
these progenitors no the anther is

110
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,129
growing quickly at this point and that

111
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:37,159
occurs by primarily by anticlinal

112
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,800
divisions that add length and girth to

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,350
the anther but an extremely important

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,410
job of these artists Oriole cells is to

115
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:48,620
secrete knack one and that causes the

116
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,650
l2d neighbor the cell that's just

117
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,050
sub-epidermal to undergo a peri clinal

118
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,699
division setting up the endothelium

119
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,819
which is the layer adjacent to the

120
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,670
epidermis and a sub epidermal cell

121
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,740
called the secondary parietal cell this

122
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:07,660
cell will later divide Perry Cline early

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:12,319
to make the middle layer in the 2p dome

124
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,420
so one of our discoveries after kind of

125
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,730
figuring out the sequence of events in

126
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,730
ontogeny was that environmental

127
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,920
conditions actually trigger the

128
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,620
specification of that artists Oriole

129
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,819
cell and it's hypoxia is the

130
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,459
environmental trigger so this was not

131
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:34,659
quite a guess the graduate student

132
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:38,180
involved Tim Kelleher had done a lot of

133
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,910
RNA analysis transcriptome analysis and

134
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,579
in the early days of that let's go back

135
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,889
to 2010 or so what you ended up was huge

136
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:48,800
piles of data and no insight

137
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,860
but what paid off was a long long time

138
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,139
ago I had worked on hypoxic roots and

139
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,658
when I looked at the transcriptome of

140
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,418
these very immature answers I saw all

141
00:06:56,658 --> 00:07:01,819
the signature that I had seen in in

142
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:05,508
young root tissue that was exposed to

143
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:07,699
excess water so we used an oxygen

144
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,550
electrode that's contained inside this

145
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:13,999
26 gauge needle to measure the amount of

146
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,968
oxygen in the airspace around the

147
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:20,840
developing tassel so right when this

148
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:22,879
specification event occurs the column of

149
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,128
air that's inside the world of maize

150
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,979
leaves out here near the surface it's

151
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:30,169
close to ambient it goes down down down

152
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:32,418
because the young leaves are not

153
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:35,149
photosynthetic they're living off

154
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:37,188
respiration they're sucking the air the

155
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:40,370
oxygen out of this air and so around the

156
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,278
tassel it's down at 1.4 percent oxygen

157
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,139
for about three days and that's enough

158
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:49,189
to cause the specification of that

159
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:52,728
column of our tutorial cells and we went

160
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:56,778
on to do experimental tests of that by

161
00:07:52,728 --> 00:08:00,408
using tiny needles or hoses threaded

162
00:07:56,778 --> 00:08:03,769
down the column of air and we attached

163
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:06,560
the hoses to either an oxygen tank or a

164
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:09,139
nitrogen tank so we could add lots of

165
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,360
extra oxygen or purge it all out with

166
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:15,860
nitrogen making it super hypoxic and

167
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,278
this is kind of a complicated slide but

168
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,649
the punchline is that if you use

169
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:25,038
nitrogen that is make it more hypoxic

170
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:27,978
you get precocious and extra argus

171
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,288
Floreal cells in fact violating one of

172
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:33,439
the fundamentals of botany we could

173
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:37,088
convert epidermal cells to pre mitotic

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,719
cells if we applied the hypoxia severely

175
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:44,449
oxygen delays the specification if we

176
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,420
look at just this graph importantly

177
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:49,490
though here in green is what happens

178
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:52,819
with nitrogen so precocious and

179
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,360
seemingly extra but it tops out at the

180
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,220
same point as control or the oxygen

181
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,659
treatment so the process is

182
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,389
self-regulating Yuwen

183
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:05,959
at the same point even if you're delayed

184
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:09,559
by adding oxygen and the key event here

185
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:13,129
is the arcus boreal cell specification

186
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:16,699
they act through this Mac one small

187
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:18,919
molecule on these sub-epidermal l2d

188
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,740
cells converting them to primary

189
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,750
parietal cells those cells then undergo

190
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:31,419
the peri clonal division that sets up

191
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:34,909
the two somatic cell types okay so this

192
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:38,059
ontogeny was very satisfying in terms of

193
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:42,679
an explanation but we had still many

194
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:44,629
many questions about Mac one so we knew

195
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,149
from experiments I'm not showing that

196
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:49,309
it's a secreted protein it's processed

197
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,529
to a smaller form and things like that

198
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:54,109
but a lot of things we couldn't

199
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:57,049
determine for example when Argos boreal

200
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:01,220
cells secrete this protein does it act

201
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:03,740
globally or does it act locally so in

202
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,960
plant biology we're often thinking of

203
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,000
hormones say in the vasculature and then

204
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,180
they arrive someplace and they influence

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,129
a lot of cells it's important to keep in

206
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:15,589
mind that these anther lobes have no

207
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:18,350
meristem there is no organizing center

208
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,110
so this small molecule being secreted by

209
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,300
a newly specified it cell could be a

210
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,659
type of organizing Center a type of

211
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:29,719
organizing molecule so all of these

212
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,269
questions sort of haunted us and the way

213
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,000
that we solved it at least in part was

214
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,100
to convert a pathogen we've worked with

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,440
called oyster legume a dose it's a

216
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,009
fungal pathogen pathogen that's a bio

217
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,240
troph it doesn't kill or even enter maze

218
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:49,189
cells so when it hits am a cell it

219
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,860
causes the plasma membrane of the may

220
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:57,280
cell to imaginate so that the fungal

221
00:10:51,860 --> 00:11:01,730
hypha is inside this a plastic space and

222
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,909
we engineered gusta la go to secrete the

223
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,769
Mac one protein under a booster logo

224
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:09,769
promoter that acts on the second and

225
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:12,139
third day after infection so that was

226
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,409
enough time for the fungus to get

227
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:16,490
sub-epidermal a

228
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:20,818
and be in contact with those Ltd cells

229
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,519
so the important experiment was to apply

230
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:26,338
this special strain which we call a

231
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,370
Trojan horse because it's delivering a

232
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,670
secret package the Mac one protein to

233
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,310
the walls the apple plastics base of the

234
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:40,198
plant was to ask what happens in a Mac

235
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:42,809
one mutant so this is a schematic it's

236
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:45,448
actually a tracing of a confocal image

237
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:48,109
of what a fertile anther looks like at

238
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:51,929
this stage there's artists poriyal cells

239
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:54,688
there's sub epidermal cells and then

240
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:58,109
there's the epidermis and over here in

241
00:11:54,688 --> 00:12:00,059
Mac one there's epidermis and sub

242
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,669
epidermal cells and Argos Oriole cells

243
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,028
but we've colored them differently

244
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:07,889
because there's just one layer and and

245
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:11,129
here there's two layers because the peri

246
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:13,169
clonal division has occurred now when we

247
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,930
in fact with a control strain of boost a

248
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:18,899
logo that has no cargo other than a

249
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:23,008
fluorescent protein we can track the

250
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:25,350
hyphy inside maze and these arrows point

251
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:28,259
to regions that have that bio trophic

252
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,420
interface and what's nifty about the bio

253
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:34,169
trophic interface is it's approximately

254
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:37,039
the same width as the space between a

255
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:40,198
typical arcus foreo cell and its

256
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,179
putative somatic neighbour so we're kind

257
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,578
of recreating the distance that the

258
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,309
protein would have to travel here's the

259
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:50,239
Trojan horse train it makes a similar

260
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:54,049
number of by atrophic interfaces and we

261
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,149
could find in the fun G both thee as

262
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:59,698
made from the gene and the process

263
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:03,149
secreted form of the protein and the

264
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:07,669
most amost important assay was how often

265
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:10,470
are there additional cells that are

266
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:12,808
penetrated by the L 2 D cell that then

267
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,028
or where the fungal hyphae have made

268
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:17,338
this intimate association that have gone

269
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:19,980
undergone the peri clonal division and

270
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:23,160
in the control strain it's really low

271
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:27,430
under 10% but when you have the Trojan

272
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:30,039
horse it's about 60% so way

273
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,429
more than half of the penetrated cells

274
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:36,069
that received the Mac one protein

275
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:39,909
underwent the peri clean revision but no

276
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,860
neighbor cell ever did it so it means

277
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,319
that the Mac one signal is cell

278
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,209
autonomous it's secreted by an artist

279
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,028
Oriole cell and it has to act on a

280
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:52,088
recipient cell presumably there's a

281
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:56,250
receptor and we later cloned receptor

282
00:13:52,089 --> 00:14:00,370
it's a homolog of the rice msp1 receptor

283
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:03,789
and there's no signaling between these

284
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,019
l2d cells that say oh I saw Mac one so

285
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:07,419
you should do this you're my neighbor

286
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,829
each cell needs to get the signals

287
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:15,778
separately now in addition to defining

288
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:20,500
this positive signal we also defined a

289
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:22,990
repressive signal it's controlled by an

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,470
epidermal transcription factor called OC

291
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,659
l4 and it makes a mobile signal and

292
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,580
we'll learn more about what the identity

293
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:35,079
of that might be later in the seminar

294
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:38,950
and it suppresses extra sub-epidermal ie

295
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,889
endo these--all peri clonal divisions so

296
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:45,250
in the ocl for mutant instead of having

297
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:48,179
just one layer of sub epidermal

298
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:52,208
endothelial cells you have two layers in

299
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:54,519
half of the sphere you might say of the

300
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:57,458
lobe it's the outer like the northern

301
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,039
hemisphere basically in the Mac one

302
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:02,109
mutant when it's just Mac one you have

303
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,659
lots and lots of extra artists Oriole

304
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,629
cells because the soma isn't specified

305
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:09,969
and it basically stops dividing so the

306
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:13,269
central space as the anther grows just

307
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:16,570
fills with pre mitotic cells when you

308
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:20,259
make the double mutant the sub epidermal

309
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:23,680
cells in the absence of whatever ocl for

310
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:27,250
does undergo a peri clonal division so

311
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,708
there's two controls of this really

312
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,528
important setup of the soma one is an

313
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:34,929
activating signal the Mac one ligand and

314
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:37,208
the other is a repressive signal and

315
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,819
that's become a common theme in in

316
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,959
developmental biology if you apply the

317
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,580
gas

318
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,830
more of something you also need to have

319
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:49,480
brakes and make sure that you can stop

320
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:51,490
it in time so this is a review slide now

321
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,889
so if there was going to be an exam I

322
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,759
would hear all the four color pens in

323
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:58,330
the room click summarizing what we've

324
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,330
learned

325
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,300
so we initiate Arcos poriyal

326
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,460
specification by hypoxia which is

327
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:10,059
naturally imposed by the way that corn

328
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,519
grows and it acts through miss Kawana

329
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:16,049
glue to read oxen in the Miska one you

330
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:19,809
know Argos for oil sells are specified

331
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:22,659
okay once they are they're shown in

332
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:25,509
purple they secrete Mack one and they

333
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:28,839
convert their neighbor Ltd sells one at

334
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:31,899
a time to primary parietal cells and the

335
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,450
job of those PPC cells is to divide peri

336
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,629
finally to make the secondary parietal

337
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,420
layer and the endothelium and then ocl

338
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:42,759
for acts from the epidermis to prevent

339
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:47,829
these green cells from dividing peri

340
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:50,139
cleanly again so that's a good review I

341
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:54,490
hope you're up-to-date now about Bayes

342
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:57,519
anthers it turns out ocl 4 has another

343
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,659
job and that is it controls the

344
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,690
production of 21 nucleotide bazi RNAs

345
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:07,269
these fazzy rnase the biogenesis factors

346
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,490
are localized in the epidermis exactly

347
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:13,959
where the ACL for transcription factor

348
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:16,750
localizes but the fazzy RNAs are small

349
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,750
and they accumulate throughout the soma

350
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,000
of the anther lobe they could be the

351
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,039
mobile signal that suppresses peri

352
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,099
clonal division we don't know that for

353
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:29,170
sure but that's our working hypothesis

354
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,899
so before sort of talking more about

355
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:35,080
that hypothesis I think I need to tell

356
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:39,420
you a bit what fozzy RNAs are so we

357
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:42,279
discovered these in 2006 working with

358
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,910
cinders lab at UC Davis he was working

359
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:49,569
on rice we were working on corn and Lou

360
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:52,660
Bowman came from Clemson University to

361
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,460
do some work in my lab and he was an

362
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,999
expert on small RNA and

363
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,429
boom we had all these small rnas we were

364
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:03,610
so miss defied by them we didn't publish

365
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,669
for three years so I mean for graduate

366
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:08,229
students don't despair like when you

367
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:10,869
don't if you don't understand something

368
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,970
sometimes it's better to wait anyway we

369
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:15,339
waited for a few years and then we

370
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,759
published and the the reason that these

371
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:20,980
small RNAs were mysterious I know it

372
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,470
recall that the Carrington lab and

373
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,470
others had I then found tazzy RNA

374
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,950
strands acting small interfering RNAs

375
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,329
and was that kind of a forest of

376
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,210
different small interfering RNAs

377
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:36,189
particularly in plants the hallmark of

378
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,090
each and every one of those is it had an

379
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:43,269
mRNA target our problem is the fazzy

380
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:46,628
RNAs have no targets that you can

381
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:49,509
identify in the transcriptome so they do

382
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:52,509
not match a messenger RNA they have some

383
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:54,519
other function and just to confess now

384
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:57,159
that's still the state of the art

385
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:01,388
although we have some guesses about what

386
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:04,720
they might be doing okay so now you'll

387
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:06,219
want to know how to make one of these so

388
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,110
for those of you who are affiliate

389
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,679
familiar with the biogenesis of

390
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:14,618
transacting silencing RNA s but the sort

391
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,249
of steps are really similar but there's

392
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:20,648
different players so for the twenty one

393
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:22,480
nucleotide Fozzie's in maze there's

394
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:25,719
approximately four hundred and forty

395
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,210
different loci and they make a long

396
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,179
non-coding RNA that gets capped and

397
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:36,610
polyadenylated just like an mrna this

398
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,340
molecule is then bound by an Argonaut

399
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:43,589
and Argonaut one that's carrying a micro

400
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:46,868
RNA called two one one eight and we just

401
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:48,428
discovered and it's unpublished and

402
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:52,148
likely to be unpublished for a while

403
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:54,879
that this complex is actually bound to a

404
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:58,329
ribosome bound to ribosomes I should say

405
00:19:54,878 --> 00:20:02,528
poly somes and that almost all of the

406
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:03,278
Fazle site contained short Orff's so the

407
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:06,878
short orphe

408
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:07,660
ensures loading onto the ribosome so it

409
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:10,449
does

410
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,150
you might say like a messenger RNA we

411
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,100
have yet to find any of the peptide

412
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,470
predicted peptides though so we're not

413
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:20,559
sure if they're translated or they could

414
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,589
have a very short half-life anyway on

415
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:28,169
the ribosome there is cleavage by the

416
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:32,230
micro RNA - one one eight right here and

417
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:35,500
almost simultaneous copying by reverse

418
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:40,049
transcriptase Rd R six that makes the

419
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:42,430
second strand of RNA and then Dicer for

420
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:45,579
attaches to this double stranded region

421
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:47,560
and precisely chops it starting at the

422
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,649
five prime end into twenty one

423
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:53,500
nucleotide double stranded segments only

424
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,460
one of which is typically preserved so

425
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,920
that's a little bit mysterious and these

426
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,950
retained small RNAs are bound by a go v

427
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:07,240
c and they constitute the 21 nucleotide

428
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:10,920
as an RNA population know the 24

429
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,660
nucleotide fasces have a very similar

430
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,600
ontogeny but they have a different

431
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,610
specific micro RNA they have a different

432
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:22,240
region of complementarity than these

433
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:25,929
guys to a specific micro RNA they're

434
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,019
copied by rd r6 but then a novel dice

435
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:32,140
earth that's basically monocot specific

436
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:35,619
the gene duplication from Dicer 3 dates

437
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:40,800
back about 80 million years so this is

438
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:44,079
Paula and some closely related families

439
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,259
Dicer 5 chops it into 24 nucleotide

440
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:50,529
small RNAs and we don't yet know what

441
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:53,019
Argonaut finds those small RNAs it makes

442
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:56,500
a large population of 24 nucleotide

443
00:21:53,019 --> 00:22:00,869
Pazzis so a typical precursor generates

444
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:03,339
between 20 and 50 small rnas each and

445
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:05,500
the reason that we discovered them so

446
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:09,009
long ago when methods were really crude

447
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,789
is these guys are unbelievably abundant

448
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:16,450
and they also show very distinct

449
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:20,329
temporal deployment in anthers they are

450
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:23,720
anther specific in the power

451
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:26,059
in other plants they are at least floral

452
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,579
specific they might be anther specific

453
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:32,990
that people haven't dissected answers to

454
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:35,119
demonstrate that so back here at 0.2

455
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,750
millimeter is right when the Argos

456
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:42,049
Oriole cells are being specified and 0.4

457
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,839
is when the somatic cells specification

458
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:46,849
has finished and most of the cells the

459
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,189
primary parietal cells have undergone

460
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:50,779
the parry clinal division that sets up

461
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:56,110
and to feast him and the secondary

462
00:22:50,779 --> 00:23:02,240
parietal and here's the 21 nucleotide

463
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:06,019
Bazzi micro RNA right here so you can

464
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,529
see it's made a little bit a for the 0.4

465
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:13,639
stage but it Peaks here here's the faz

466
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:17,029
low sy so they're incredibly abundant at

467
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,090
0.4 from barely there and here's the

468
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:22,519
proportion of all 21 nucleotide small

469
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:25,899
RNAs including all the micro RNAs that

470
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:30,170
are actually fazzy so at 0.4

471
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:34,759
approximately 65% of all 21 nucleotide

472
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:37,460
RNAs are faz er is and the proportion

473
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,460
declines over time but they're retained

474
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:44,329
through mid meiosis at reasonably

475
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:47,620
abundant levels no for the 24 nucleotide

476
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:51,079
phase low sy there's a tiny bit of

477
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:54,169
transcript production and small RNA

478
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:57,079
production early but the Big Bang so to

479
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,390
speak of setting up the precursors and

480
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:02,029
the micro RNA that are required starts

481
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,070
at one millimeter which is the

482
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:06,349
transition between artists for L cells

483
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:09,259
and POW and mother cells if you're

484
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:11,929
tracking the germinal cells and is also

485
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:14,240
as I'll point out in more detail later a

486
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:17,900
time when the 2p tamari differentiates

487
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,870
and then peak abundance of the 24

488
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,810
nucleotide Fozzie's occurs at 2

489
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:26,059
millimeters which is late prophase 1

490
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:29,119
towards the end could be the end of

491
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:32,179
meiosis 1 when there are close to 70

492
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,279
percent of all the 24 nucleotide small

493
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,789
RNAs

494
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:40,250
so these guys were easy to find even

495
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:44,180
with crude methods if you dissected

496
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:47,750
anthers of the right stage and the

497
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:51,230
amount of them is millions of copies per

498
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:55,970
cell so we're talking about a huge

499
00:24:51,230 --> 00:25:00,430
amount of small RNA we also always track

500
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:04,480
other types of small RNA those

501
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:10,160
repressors of transposons and has three

502
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:12,740
types Moll rnase okay so in addition to

503
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,500
temporal separation of now what are two

504
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,769
classes of small RNA as the rnase

505
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,980
there's also spatial separation so i've

506
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:24,440
already mentioned that the epidermis and

507
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,360
specifically dependent on the ocl for

508
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,970
transcription factor which is

509
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:32,509
preferentially expressed kind of at the

510
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:35,450
North Pole sort of a limited arc here on

511
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:37,210
the outer part of each lobe that's where

512
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,400
the micro RNA - one one eight

513
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:43,720
predominance predominates and also the

514
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,190
precursor transcripts twenty one faz

515
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,360
although they're sort of found elsewhere

516
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:53,230
including what we think is artefactual

517
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:56,869
hybridization - the arcus oriole cells

518
00:25:53,230 --> 00:26:00,200
Dicer for their required cleaving enzyme

519
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:02,989
is also pretty widely distributed and

520
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,539
for sure the product the 21 nucleotide

521
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:09,500
Fozzie's are widely distributed in the

522
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:12,079
anthers we think this and other evidence

523
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,470
that I'm not sharing means that the 21

524
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:20,720
fat RNAs are mobile we think they start

525
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:23,930
here and they're spreading into the rest

526
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,029
of the soma now what about the 24

527
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:29,299
nucleotide Fozzie's we're looking at an

528
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:31,789
older anther now and the required micro

529
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:34,789
RNA for cleaving the precursor is highly

530
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:39,589
enriched in the 2p dome as are the 24

531
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:42,859
nucleotide faz low sigh as is Dicer 5

532
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:45,750
the required processing enzyme as are

533
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:48,389
the 24 nucleotide small rnas

534
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,440
so I know there's one report here from

535
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:56,330
Cornell from wojtek's lab and one from

536
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:00,920
Japan I think that has evidence that the

537
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:04,220
now Pollan mother cells or Maya sites

538
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:07,830
contain 24 nucleotide fazzy rnase

539
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,740
potentially at a low level but we find

540
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:13,079
unfortunately that any in-situ probe we

541
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,049
put on especially this stage of anthers

542
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,869
sticks to the kalos code that surrounds

543
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:22,139
the Maya site so that's very

544
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:25,469
unsatisfying in terms of knowing whether

545
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,990
it's true or not and then in a separate

546
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:31,559
study that I'm not talking about today a

547
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,190
postdoc in the lab has purified Arcos

548
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:39,059
poriyal cells pmc and Maya sites for

549
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:42,930
single RNA seek and finds neither the

550
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:46,109
fabs precursors nor Dicer five in those

551
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:48,150
cells so it remains an open question if

552
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:50,250
the fazzy rnas are there they're

553
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:55,170
probably imported from the tip edom

554
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:58,160
rather than made in situ and then

555
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:02,100
finally in addition to spatiotemporal

556
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,320
separation the two classes of fazzy rnas

557
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:06,869
are independently regulated genetically

558
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,720
so i've already pointed out that ocl

559
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:12,959
four is required to make the 21

560
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,360
nucleotide Pazzis and the micro RNA

561
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,789
levels are greatly reduced the fasces

562
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,369
are virtually gone and almost all the

563
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:23,190
precursors are gone but the pattern of

564
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:25,829
24 nucleotide fatty biogenesis is

565
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,890
basically normal and the opposite is

566
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:31,619
true for Miska one which basically never

567
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:34,950
gets started so it doesn't have a two

568
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:37,319
peetam mak one lacks a tepee dome and ms

569
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,200
23 has a very defective two peetam

570
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,329
they're all making the 21 nucleotide

571
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,210
fazzy rnas which are characteristic of

572
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:49,619
very early stages but they're failing to

573
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:56,069
make the 24 nucleotide Pazzis the micro

574
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:57,989
RNA to 275 is made in ms 23 mutants but

575
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,359
it's from a different locus to different

576
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,849
loci

577
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,789
is represented over here so there's

578
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:06,980
activation of alternative loci but

579
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:09,379
there's no precursor to process so

580
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:13,329
there's basically no Fozzie's produced

581
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:18,170
and a mitotic one which is a mutant that

582
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:20,928
fails to do a correct meiosis it does

583
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:23,269
mitosis instead of meiosis in these

584
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:27,610
pollen mother cells it has both

585
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:31,519
relatively normal 21 and 24 nucleotide

586
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:36,649
rnas suggesting that they're not like

587
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,450
stimulators of of meiosis okay so it may

588
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,340
have crossed your mind since I'm amazed

589
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,470
geneticists and we tend to be kind of

590
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:43,939
narrow-minded that maybe we found

591
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,029
something that's absolutely amazing

592
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,220
specific we used to my seminar at this

593
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:51,918
point used to talk about how and how

594
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,740
special the grass is where etc but a

595
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,610
couple of smart students in like Myers

596
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,669
lab our collaborators decided to check

597
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:05,089
non grass monocots and a paper has just

598
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:07,850
come out in genome for asparagus Lily de

599
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:11,918
Lille and some other non grass monocots

600
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:14,869
they all have reproductive as the RNAs

601
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,600
they're also another person in Blake's

602
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:20,239
lab found their present sporadically in

603
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,909
different families of dicots he was an

604
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,970
expert on lychee like who would both

605
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:28,220
choose that tree to do the work it turns

606
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,110
out it's easy to get anthers and sure

607
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,990
enough the reproductive aziz were there

608
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:35,178
and that was followed by collaborators

609
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:39,099
who supplied strawberry tomato and a

610
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:42,650
whole lot of other daikon anthers and

611
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:45,918
sorry to report the one family where

612
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:48,320
there is zip is the brass of kce so air

613
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,540
bird OPS's is not a model for this and

614
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,918
there's some other major families where

615
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:57,379
they're extremely rare and then another

616
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:01,220
place where we should think about these

617
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:04,100
male specific reproductive small rnas

618
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:07,100
are the pie rnas that are found in

619
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:09,490
million testes so these are absolutely

620
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:12,049
required for successful sperm production

621
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,380
interestingly just like plants there's

622
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:16,769
two size classes

623
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:20,040
one is made before meiosis one is made

624
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:22,859
during meiosis but not in the germinal

625
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,710
cells it's in the supporting cells there

626
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:29,579
are no known functions because they

627
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:32,340
don't match messenger rna's so it looks

628
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:34,799
like convergent evolution to aid male

629
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:37,259
reproduction in the mammals and the

630
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:42,480
flowering plants something I find very

631
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:44,640
odd what is also interesting is we've

632
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,250
worked out the biogenesis mechanisms in

633
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,370
them in the poaceae and there's

634
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:53,039
different biogenesis mechanisms in the

635
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:56,519
non grass monocots and in the dicots and

636
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,769
in the mammalian pi rnase so although

637
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,900
you end up with the same types of small

638
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:03,660
RNA product superabundant it's very

639
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:07,940
specific times in male reproduction

640
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,940
they're not made in exactly the same way

641
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,299
okay now I'd like to talk in more detail

642
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:18,000
about the 24 nucleotide disease and

643
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:21,599
something about the tepee 'dom so tepee

644
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,140
dome is whoops now it's working it's not

645
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:29,990
weird

646
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:34,880
oh no it's really bad sorry

647
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:37,470
you're good with integrating tiny okay

648
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,360
for tippy-toe cell development we've

649
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,420
demonstrated that it's controlled by a

650
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,099
cascade of basic helix-loop-helix

651
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:48,720
transcription factors starting with the

652
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:51,359
master regulator male sterile 23 which

653
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,240
acts actually in the secondary parietal

654
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:57,889
cells and it's important for achieving

655
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,960
the correct peri clonal division and

656
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:03,360
steps after that

657
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,059
now what's underappreciated is that

658
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,579
capital cells are born and perform a

659
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:10,769
suite of functions and then during

660
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:13,589
meiosis they have to read if ur n qi 8

661
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:16,230
so they're differentiated before meiosis

662
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:18,119
to do one set of jobs then they read if

663
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,509
ur n she ate four functions late in

664
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:24,389
meiosis and add even more functions to

665
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:26,490
support gametophyte s' and all of the

666
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:29,190
celery differentiation

667
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:34,710
to require the 24 nucleotide fazzy rnase

668
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:37,140
and starting with ms 23 is a master

669
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,450
regulator of the chip enum and also as

670
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:43,350
the master regulator of 24 nucleotide

671
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:45,000
fazzy RNA biogenesis and it acts in part

672
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:48,569
through regulating these other of the

673
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,990
HLHS so the production of the correct

674
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:58,529
micro RNA the precursors the Dicer all

675
00:33:51,990 --> 00:34:01,679
depend on MS 23 now among these various

676
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:04,349
players many of them are redundant or

677
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,920
partially redundant so there's four low

678
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:10,079
Sian Corning encoding micro RNA to 275

679
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,289
for example we have a lot of different

680
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,340
Argonauts etc the only thing that was a

681
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:20,219
single copy gene was Dicer 5 and so we

682
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,860
decided to use CRISPR pass 9 to mutate

683
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:27,000
this singular gene and find out what

684
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:31,649
would happen to development of the

685
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,679
anther so it's a honking big gene and we

686
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:37,319
recovered numerous mutants and for those

687
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,179
not working on maize what's really great

688
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,580
about maize is when we do the

689
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:44,128
transformation it's of a single cell of

690
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:46,799
an embryo and culture and it appears

691
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:47,699
that the CRISPR past 9 system acts in

692
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,310
that cell

693
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,199
so more than 95% of the plants that are

694
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:55,349
regenerated or by allele it they have

695
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,779
mutations in both alleles independent

696
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:00,839
mutations and so it's easy to recover

697
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,790
lots of different alleles and we've

698
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:07,829
characterized carefully four of those

699
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:11,279
alleles and thank goodness for this even

700
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:15,690
in the t0 those first initial plants the

701
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,930
Dicer 5 plants are male sterile and I

702
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,210
mean clear male sterility this is what a

703
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:25,139
tassel looks like that has anthers out

704
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:27,780
this is a heterozygote of the Dicer 5-1

705
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:31,829
allele with the wild-type this is a

706
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:35,010
homozygote Dicer 5-1 and so at the stage

707
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:37,980
when lots of anthers are out on this

708
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:41,250
tassel there's nothing out this

709
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:44,820
and Dicer 5 is absolutely required to

710
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,679
produce the 24 nucleotide fazzy RNAs and

711
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,619
I'll show you that data in the sack

712
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,710
and in all of our early studies the

713
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:54,390
mutations in Dicer fide conferred male

714
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,210
sterility under field or greenhouse

715
00:35:54,389 --> 00:36:00,239
conditions and it was from Capitola read

716
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,190
differentiation failure so during the

717
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,799
penal cells are there and they've done

718
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,420
some measurable functions normally but

719
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,519
they failed to read if ER n she ate as

720
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:14,190
secretory cells during meiosis so here's

721
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,889
the demonstration that the 24 nucleotide

722
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,409
Fozzie's which are extremely abundant at

723
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:22,049
1.5 and even more abundant at 2

724
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:25,949
millimeters are almost completely gone

725
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,900
in the mutants I have to tell you that

726
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,939
there's a couple of the phase low sigh

727
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,430
that slightly overlap with protein

728
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,409
coding genes and so in the severe

729
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:36,179
mutants basically what you're seeing is

730
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:40,098
some small RNA production from the

731
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:43,469
protein coding genes this is a twelve

732
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:50,480
nucleotide deletion so four amino acids

733
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:53,549
and it's a very low function allele and

734
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,460
also important the Dicer v mutation as

735
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:59,130
expected selectively blocks accumulation

736
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,818
of 24 nucleotide Fozzie's and doesn't

737
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:05,460
influence the 21 nucleotide fazzy class

738
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:08,519
it doesn't influence other types of 24

739
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,338
nucleotides small RNA so basically only

740
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:14,759
orange is super depressed or missing and

741
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:18,179
the other types of small RNA are normal

742
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,700
and again I'm not showing you all the

743
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:24,269
data for this but in these mutants the

744
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:27,299
fast precursors accumulate so the low sy

745
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:30,329
in this case about 170 loci are still

746
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,789
copiously transcribed and those mRNA

747
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:35,490
like molecules accumulate because there

748
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:37,170
is no processing and that's what you'd

749
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:42,779
expect for a precursor product

750
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:45,450
relationship okay so obviously we love

751
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:49,109
to look at anthers it's a microscope and

752
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:50,579
in looking at the Dicer v mutant at key

753
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:54,170
stages

754
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:57,989
from the somatic specification stage

755
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:01,860
through Pollan mother cell and stages of

756
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:04,309
meiosis the architecture that is the

757
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:08,720
cellular anatomy was indistinguishable

758
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:12,449
between the Dicer v mutant and controls

759
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:15,179
so we could not find any defect in the

760
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:17,969
pace or pattern of cell division in the

761
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:21,239
size of the cells in the number of cells

762
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:25,829
just seemed the same and we're not

763
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:28,829
experts at meiosis but this was done by

764
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:30,539
Han Zhang who was a graduate student in

765
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,799
Kelly DAWs lab where she did learn how

766
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:36,599
to do all the mitotic staging and again

767
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,350
meiosis appeared to be completely normal

768
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,759
in the Dicer v so we're looking at a

769
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:43,829
male sterile when we're wondering like

770
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,750
what the heck is wrong with these plants

771
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:51,179
why why are they male sterile so we need

772
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:53,969
to kind of return to what goes on in the

773
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:59,190
tepee 'dom from birth into some of its

774
00:38:53,969 --> 00:39:02,189
specific jobs so in an anther at about

775
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:05,940
five hundred and fifty microns each lobe

776
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:10,050
has 600 secondary parietal cells and if

777
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,750
you label with edu which is a tea analog

778
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:15,539
it's incorporated into DNA it's

779
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:19,199
non-toxic it's a really great label and

780
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:22,829
then later you use click at chemistry to

781
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,230
attach a fluorescent label to the edu

782
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:28,519
molecules that have been incorporated

783
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:32,250
into DNA so the secondary parietal layer

784
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:34,829
is basically these green dots that's one

785
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,900
lobe here's another lobe so

786
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:39,119
approximately half of the secondary

787
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,000
parietal cells we'll label in a two-hour

788
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,519
edu incubation so they're not

789
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,530
synchronous but they're at this stage

790
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,259
lots of the cells are getting ready to

791
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,120
do that very important peri clinal

792
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,910
division that makes the tepee demand

793
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,339
middle layer and in fact if you chart

794
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:58,829
that you see that the division at least

795
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:02,550
in the inbred we use is completely

796
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:03,949
symmetric so the final volume of the two

797
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,019
cell types

798
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:08,509
and and each of their dimensions are

799
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:12,320
identical so it's a very clonal division

800
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,970
that's perfect in is the term used in

801
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:20,230
the literature it makes two equivalent

802
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:24,289
cells okay so now we've we've made the

803
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:28,309
tippy-toe cells back here and their

804
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:30,429
first key job after some period of rapid

805
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:34,250
proliferation for a couple of days is

806
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:36,649
they secrete the palace that remodels

807
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:39,320
the kalos that's been secreted by the

808
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,840
pollen mother cells so the pollen other

809
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,780
cells secrete excess kalos it's kind of

810
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,690
lumpy and weird-looking and the Cowley's

811
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,970
causes it to be a smooth coat that in

812
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,179
cases each pollen mother cell in a shell

813
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:57,259
kind of like an mmm

814
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:59,750
then during meiosis the Tepito cells

815
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,930
begin to synthesize the components of

816
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:05,780
the x i'm so those are the sporophytic

817
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:08,989
compounds that end up being placed on

818
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,210
pollen as it develops weirdly the

819
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:13,639
tippy-toe cells also become by nuclei

820
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,369
which is a feature in almost all

821
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:19,190
angiosperms that has no explanation why

822
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:22,039
not just be polyploid no they've got to

823
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:26,050
have two nuclei and they also remodel

824
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:31,039
the wall that faces the developing

825
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:33,560
myocytes and subsequent micro

826
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,519
gametophyte s' and this wall remodeling

827
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,440
is extremely important for secretion

828
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,090
because at the end of meiosis they begin

829
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,130
to secrete these things that they've

830
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,320
been making and they do that through

831
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,890
this super elaborate plasma membrane

832
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:52,400
that perforates a wall that's now mostly

833
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:55,789
dissolved and then they do one last

834
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,910
thing for the anther about five days

835
00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:02,480
later few days later they die program

836
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:05,210
cell death and those the collapse of the

837
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,679
remaining Tepito wall makes something

838
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:12,440
that we call biological velcro so each

839
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,929
developing micro gametophyte oops sorry

840
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,440
about that

841
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:19,599
each developing micro gametophyte needs

842
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,409
to find a place on this biological

843
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,719
Velcro so this is found in about 10% of

844
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:28,089
angiosperms where the micro gametophyte

845
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:31,389
sneed to attach to the dead tippy-toe

846
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:33,850
wall it's kind of like musical chairs if

847
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:36,759
you don't find a spot if you're left in

848
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:38,829
here you stop developing so it's an

849
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,080
absolute requirement to get viable

850
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:42,880
pollen that each and every one of these

851
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,509
microbe immuno fights get to one of

852
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,309
these two peed on landing pads so you

853
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,650
can see or I hope I've convinced you

854
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:53,170
that the peetam isn't just one thing

855
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,539
like to say it's a nutritive layer kind

856
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,300
of overlooks it the sequential jobs that

857
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:00,519
it performs this gave us a lot of

858
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,860
characters that we could use to judge

859
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,440
what's wrong in those dice or five

860
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,150
mutants

861
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,119
so by transmission

862
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:13,090
eeehm here's wild-type we see that the

863
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,460
tippy toe cells have two nuclei we could

864
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:18,840
see nuclei typically and they're really

865
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:21,670
dark staining they're filled with Xing

866
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:24,490
components whereas the Dicer five

867
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,809
mutants are very pale they're not making

868
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:33,039
exon and then also very clear this is a

869
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:36,039
special kind of microscopy analysis

870
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:39,219
called 3d segmentation where yellow

871
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:41,949
represents by nucleic cells and purple

872
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:45,759
mononuclear there's a lot more by

873
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:48,429
nucleus cells at various stages one and

874
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:54,030
a half for 2.5 millimeter in wild-type

875
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:58,269
Banyon immune so it appears that the

876
00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:00,820
Dicer 5 mutant Tepito cells are failing

877
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:04,690
to different read if ur n she ate in a

878
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:06,580
timely fashion some make it some make by

879
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,190
nucleus cells which is one of the last

880
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:12,099
steps they might be accumulating a small

881
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,590
amount of X I'm but they're not normal

882
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,750
and so they're either delayed or

883
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,030
arrested in some aspect of their

884
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:22,320
developmental program

885
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:27,310
and then we did one more experiment

886
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:30,070
always the killer so we were writing all

887
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:31,900
of this up and we said wow you know we

888
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:35,230
always grow everything under really hot

889
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,180
conditions it's corn after all let's do

890
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:39,880
a low temperature experiment and see

891
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:42,699
what happens well the big surprise is

892
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,340
that the Dicer five mutants are restored

893
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:49,359
to partial or even full fertility when

894
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:51,519
grown under cool conditions so I need to

895
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,590
tell you that we were growing under

896
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,199
what's considered optimal corn yield

897
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:58,870
conditions there's huge historical data

898
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:02,289
that says you get maximum corn yield

899
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:06,730
with 28 to 29 centigrade days and 22

900
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:08,889
degree centigrade nights for us these

901
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:11,559
are restrictive conditions you

902
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:14,679
absolutely required I survive to be

903
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,309
present if you go under cool growing

904
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,489
conditions

905
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:22,210
Dicer five is dispensable so here's

906
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:25,239
mutant pollen from the cool growing

907
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,159
conditions here's the control pollen all

908
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:30,669
in is fine we can we have self

909
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:34,569
pollinated you can also see it here's in

910
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:37,240
warm growing conditions nice day here's

911
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:39,480
the period of meiosis when we made sure

912
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:42,849
that the temperature was really high and

913
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,960
we can get sterile plants if we lower

914
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:52,500
the temperature to 26 or 23 we get

915
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,940
fertility at least partial fertility now

916
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,179
it turns out that the cool growing

917
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:01,869
conditions do not restore the 24

918
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:03,489
nucleotide phases so Dicer 5 is not

919
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:07,299
being made under cool conditions

920
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:10,689
something else is going on not only that

921
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:13,480
but the ancient duplication parrot chain

922
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:16,119
Dicer 3 which is found in all flowering

923
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,150
plants can't substitute for Dicer 5 in

924
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:23,920
making the 24 nucleotide Pazzis

925
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:27,070
so what's dispensable are the fazzy

926
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,099
rnase not just ice or five you don't

927
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:32,340
need bazi RNAs for fertility if you grow

928
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:36,730
the plants in unusually cool conditions

929
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:39,010
and we did a long series of temperature

930
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,949
shift experiments in three day

931
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:45,580
increments this is a very complicated

932
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:48,129
slide the orange area is the period of

933
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:54,009
meiosis and we were shifting plants

934
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:58,030
between 21 or 23 degrees and 28 and then

935
00:46:54,010 --> 00:47:00,700
back again and it turns out that I need

936
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:03,340
to tell you that developing maize tassel

937
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:06,639
has about seven days worth of antler

938
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:09,190
development and so to get a fully

939
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,609
fertile tassel where all of the anthers

940
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:15,309
come out you need our nine day treatment

941
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:18,070
six or nine day treatment but for any

942
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:20,949
given cohort of anthers that are of a

943
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:24,490
similar stage you only need three days

944
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:27,429
maybe less so there's a fee no critical

945
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:29,679
period during meiosis during the period

946
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:32,079
when the cioppino cells begin their read

947
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:36,339
if ur enchi ation when they either need

948
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:39,429
the fazzy 24 nucleotide RNAs or they

949
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:43,260
need cool conditions now what else does

950
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:46,809
cool conditions do it really slows down

951
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:50,110
development so meiosis is now going to

952
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:52,960
take 12 or 13 days instead of six or

953
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:56,019
seven and that also means the two petal

954
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,849
cells have a lot longer time to do

955
00:47:56,019 --> 00:48:02,170
whatever they need to do to read if ur n

956
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:05,679
she ate okay so let's get to the

957
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:08,170
conclusions here so what can we say

958
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,639
about whether 21 nucleotide fazzy RNAs

959
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:13,800
are required for Mason through

960
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:16,539
development when we eliminate them

961
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,240
genetically and now we've eliminated

962
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:23,409
them by mutating micro RNA to one one

963
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:25,359
eight we fail to get normal somatic

964
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:29,710
development and this causes meal

965
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:32,858
stability so we can say it's possible

966
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:36,099
that the mobile signal under the

967
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:39,369
control of OC l4 is in fact the fazzy

968
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:43,210
rnase and that's the hypothesis that

969
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:45,730
we're trying to test now this green

970
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:48,940
arrow points to the part of each antler

971
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:52,088
lobe that is seems to be the most

972
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:54,880
important area for the expression of ocl

973
00:48:52,088 --> 00:48:57,268
for for micro RNA two one one eight and

974
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,039
some of the other biogenesis factors

975
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:02,558
although there's no meristem maybe this

976
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,690
is a kind of signaling center in that

977
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,450
you've got information from here and it

978
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:12,099
spreads here the lobe and helps organize

979
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:14,379
the development of the soma what about

980
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:18,609
the 24 nucleotide RNAs

981
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:20,619
so if we eliminate Dicer 5 under normal

982
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:23,498
growing conditions and hence eliminate

983
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:28,630
the 24 nucleotide Fazzio rnase we get

984
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:31,689
male sterility but it seems to be not

985
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:34,690
sterility from some defect in meiosis

986
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:37,210
but from this important tip Edel celery

987
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:40,358
differentiation which seems contingent

988
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:42,599
under normal growing conditions on the

989
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:45,460
presence of the 24 nucleotide Fozzie's

990
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:48,700
so we're kind of left with a hypothesis

991
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:51,880
that in some way 24 a nucleotide fazzy

992
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:54,608
rnase aid rapid reorganization of

993
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,410
Torpedo cells so under normal growing

994
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:57,038
conditions the tippy-toe cells need to

995
00:49:56,409 --> 00:50:00,129
do things

996
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:03,849
bang-bang-bang over a day to maybe 3 and

997
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:06,940
that that is helped by having 24

998
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:09,640
nucleotide fazzy RNA is present but if

999
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,739
you slow everything down then more or

1000
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,960
less successfully the tippy-toe cells

1001
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:17,559
can reorganize themselves using a

1002
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:23,409
different pathway now this leads exactly

1003
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:25,470
into my last slide which is we have yet

1004
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:28,719
to pop the cork on this champagne

1005
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:30,399
because of course the most important

1006
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,129
thing to figure out is what are the

1007
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,759
functions the exact functions of these

1008
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:39,940
small RNAs so they could be acting in

1009
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:42,519
some unexpected way as signals for cell

1010
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:45,190
fate and differentiation I mean there's

1011
00:50:42,518 --> 00:50:46,269
many many examples of individual micro

1012
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:49,809
RNAs

1013
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:53,050
acting critical junctures to guide or

1014
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:54,940
program differentiation why would you

1015
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:58,090
need four hundred and forty twenty one

1016
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,980
nucleotide low sigh why a hundred and

1017
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:03,400
seventy that make twenty four nucleotide

1018
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:06,190
passes so if their signals their

1019
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,440
individually pretty crummy at it needs

1020
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:11,559
ilion's of them they could have

1021
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,510
cytoplasmic or nuclear roles or both or

1022
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,789
pretty convinced now they're made in the

1023
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:18,640
cytoplasm but they're not probably

1024
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:22,539
restricted to that compartment and then

1025
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:25,719
our sort of current working model I've

1026
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:28,360
nicknamed the flak hypothesis so this is

1027
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:31,509
also been suggested by some people that

1028
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:34,240
work on the million PI rnase if you

1029
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,970
accept that small RNA metabolism is

1030
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:40,149
critical for cell differentiation then

1031
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:43,689
disrupting it by putting out a huge

1032
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:47,019
number of non-functional small rnas

1033
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:50,200
could disrupt everything about small RNA

1034
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:52,840
control so it might allow for making a

1035
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:55,210
clean slate like when a cell needs to

1036
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,730
change from one state to another like

1037
00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:00,099
from a primary parietal cell to an endo

1038
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,900
these--oh and secondary parietal cell or

1039
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:04,539
when the tippy-toe cells need to read if

1040
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,730
ur n she ate if you don't have them

1041
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:09,909
maybe there's a workaround like the

1042
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:13,719
decay of the fazzy RNAs and eventually

1043
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:17,108
the regular systems takeover and micro

1044
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:19,118
RNAs can do their normal job anyway I

1045
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:21,219
realize that's not a super satisfying

1046
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,550
final hypothesis but it's what we're

1047
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:27,339
working on now with new methods to knock

1048
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:30,510
out not just one or two phase low side

1049
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:33,369
but dozens if not hundreds at a time

1050
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:35,080
okay and then it wouldn't be a good

1051
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:37,510
seminar if I didn't acknowledge the

1052
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:40,599
people who actually did the work so in

1053
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:43,000
my lab there's a number of postdoctoral

1054
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:47,500
fellows who have contributed to this

1055
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,800
plus John Fernandez a bioinformatician

1056
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,769
and then former members of the lab like

1057
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,010
karina bender linda developed the Trojan

1058
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:59,710
horse various other people worked on

1059
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,869
aspects of the talk I gave today

1060
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,119
and for the past five years and now

1061
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:06,550
continuing for four more where

1062
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,920
generously supported by the NSF in a

1063
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,820
collaboration with like Meyer slab he's

1064
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,519
expert his lab is expert on small RNA

1065
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:17,710
sequencing and analysis so I have to say

1066
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,259
we do a lot of the biology they do all

1067
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:21,909
the sequencing and together we try to

1068
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,580
figure out what's going on in these

1069
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:30,549
answers thank you very much

1070
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:30,549
[Applause]

1071
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:55,989
differentiation oh yeah despite well no

1072
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,300
they they kind of catch up with

1073
00:53:55,989 --> 00:54:02,559
everything it just takes a really long

1074
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:04,780
time because the exon is formed on the

1075
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,659
pollen like all the things that you

1076
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,580
would expect to come to the tip Edom

1077
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:12,389
eventually happen but actually pollen

1078
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:14,319
shed even if it's only like a six day

1079
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:16,389
period in cool weather

1080
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,580
it'll the pond shed will be ten days

1081
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:24,159
later than normal so you've really

1082
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:27,338
extended developmental time between the

1083
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:30,670
payara needs and mammals including the

1084
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:33,400
synthesis from customers that factors

1085
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:35,680
here for biome Genesis are leading to

1086
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,588
male sterility right I'm wondering if in

1087
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:42,940
the BC l5 you have reactivation of

1088
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:44,949
mobile elements well on the first I can

1089
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,400
say for sure there's appears to be no

1090
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:52,689
reactivation of transposons this is true

1091
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:57,300
for the Drosophila PI's and for a subset

1092
00:54:52,690 --> 00:55:01,059
about 10% of the mammalian PI RNAs are

1093
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:03,880
well are associated with some homology

1094
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:07,358
to some transposons what we seem not to

1095
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,210
have that at all and then on the DNA

1096
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:13,480
methylation front we have what I would

1097
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:16,269
say is ambiguous data on whole anthers

1098
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,059
so a postdoc now is doing laser micro

1099
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:21,969
dissection of Tepito cells since that

1100
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:26,559
seems to be where the action is to ask

1101
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:31,179
if fazzy 20 force can influence the

1102
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:33,400
level of methylation I think it's gonna

1103
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:36,190
be technically challenging because the

1104
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:39,780
by nucleate status requires one round of

1105
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:43,000
DNA synthesis and so there's actually

1106
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:46,060
you know it's not just one nucleus in

1107
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,519
one cell what if there's like an old

1108
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:51,159
nucleus and a new one you might say like

1109
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:53,590
for them if you were Hemi methylated at

1110
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:55,659
the beginning maybe you have one cell

1111
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:57,550
that retains semi methylation and one

1112
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:00,190
that's unmethylated because it got the

1113
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:03,340
unmethylated so I'm guessing that this

1114
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:05,619
is not going to be easy like to be

1115
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:10,690
really definitive on but it's her

1116
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:13,358
favorite theory because classically 24

1117
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:16,090
nucleotide small RNAs and plants are

1118
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:19,079
involved in the RNA directed DNA

1119
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:21,550
methylation pathway and so it would be

1120
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:24,759
something that you know a lot more is

1121
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:27,190
known about that from the non fazzy 24

1122
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:30,670
nucleotide class but i think pinning it

1123
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:32,800
down here is going to be tricky the the

1124
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:36,579
at the time when it matters

1125
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:39,010
about 40% not quite 40% of all the

1126
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:42,340
nuclei in an anther actually from the

1127
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:44,890
Tepito that's why we have what I would

1128
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,800
call hint of success results on whole

1129
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:59,980
anthers but not really satisfying I

1130
00:56:47,800 --> 00:57:08,050
think we need the purified cells and

1131
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:10,510
thank the speaker again this has been a
