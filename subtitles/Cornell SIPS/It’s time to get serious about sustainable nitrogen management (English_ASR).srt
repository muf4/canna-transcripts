University

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,339
there are three sources of fixed

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,559
nitrogen used in agriculture the first

5
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,329
in my far the most widely used sources

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,669
nitrogen fertilizer derived from the

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,609
haber-bosch process the second

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,929
biological nitrogen fixation accounts

9
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,960
for about thirty percent of the

10
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:27,579
agricultural nitrogen globally the third

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,710
and least important is a group of

12
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:32,829
harvested ermine sources such as fish

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,350
waste into layin nitrate in theory

14
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,599
organic farmers combine luminous cover

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,300
crops with small additions of compost to

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,039
maintain soil fertility this works for

17
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,989
some farming systems such as grain

18
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,119
production where biological nitrogen

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,179
fixation accounts for the majority of

20
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,969
newly added nitrogen however others such

21
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:53,979
as most fresh vegetable enterprises rely

22
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,929
on animal based compost as the major

23
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:58,059
source of nitrogen and are therefore

24
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:01,659
indirectly dependent on haber-bosch

25
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,370
nitrogen while recycling nutrients is a

26
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,158
fundamental principle of organic

27
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:08,950
agriculture the use of animal manures

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,450
for nitrogen is problematic first there

29
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,409
are consequences for the production

30
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,750
system including nutrient imbalances

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,340
excessive soil phosphorus levels

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,379
increase weed pressure and greater

33
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,260
vulnerability to environmental nutrient

34
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:25,239
losses from a broader perspective the

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,490
dependence on haber-bosch nitrogen

36
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,079
undermines claims that organic

37
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:32,049
agriculture is a more sustainable

38
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,030
production system the founders of

39
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,769
organic agriculture got it right when

40
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,379
they prohibited the use of haber-bosch

41
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:40,719
nitrogen and chose biological nitrogen

42
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:42,060
fixation as the primary source of new

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,319
nitrogen

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,359
biological nitrogen fixation is a

45
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,728
sustainable solar powered nitrogen

46
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:51,310
source that promotes soil organic matter

47
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:54,640
of cruel and restores internal cycling

48
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,859
processes in contrast production of

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,989
haber-bosch nitrogen is highly fossil

50
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:00,909
fuel dependent and significant

51
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:02,309
greenhouse gas emissions result from

52
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,200
this process

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,289
the amount of haber-bosch nitrogen used

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,199
is massive global usage for this year's

55
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:13,869
forecast to be 116 million metric tons

56
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,299
of nitrogen during this five minute

57
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,599
presentation 1100

58
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,640
tons of new nitrogen will be produced

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,579
furthermore haber-bosch nitrogen is

60
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,709
extremely inefficient on average half of

61
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,140
this nitrogen is lost to the biosphere

62
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,020
leading to eutrophication and greenhouse

63
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,489
gas emissions it's likely that we've

64
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,620
already altered the global nitrogen

65
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,960
cycle to a point where the extra

66
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,450
nitrogen is driving irreversible changes

67
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,610
in the biosphere

68
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:44,289
beyond these environmental concerns new

69
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,810
knowledge about the role of the plant

70
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,150
microbiome the microbial communities

71
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,860
associated with plants points the way

72
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,430
towards sustainable nutrient management

73
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,470
strategies plants and their micro biomes

74
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,689
have been co-evolving for seven hundred

75
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:01,930
million years and greater understanding

76
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:04,270
of the role of the plant microbiome has

77
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,490
overturned our view of plant nutrient

78
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,100
acquisition and biological soil

79
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,530
processes

80
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,689
decomposition is a case in point until

81
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,490
recently decomposition has been viewed

82
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,069
as a microbially governed process

83
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,200
occurring in bulk soil independent of

84
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,969
plants a view compatible with the

85
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,969
strategy of delivering available

86
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:27,310
nitrogen directly to crops it's now

87
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:30,009
clear that a continuum of plant

88
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,969
microbial associations govern

89
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:35,469
decomposition plants can stimulate

90
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,259
decomposition by providing carbon to

91
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:40,810
decomposers in exchange for nitrogen and

92
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,879
other nutrients the carbon provides

93
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,969
energy to subsidize the cost of

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,549
expensive XO enzymes decomposers must

95
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:50,560
make to free nitrogen

96
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,360
this exchange of carbon for nutrients in

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,780
the rhizosphere provides an efficient

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,610
means for delivering nitrogen to plants

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,009
so much so that even under optimal

100
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,200
fertilizer management regimes crops

101
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:04,599
still rely heavily on soil organic

102
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,869
nitrogen pools reflecting their

103
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,250
coevolution with decomposers for example

104
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,310
and conventionally managed grains

105
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,569
receiving recommended fertilizer rates

106
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,759
fertilizer nitrogen accounts for less

107
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,219
than forty percent of the night taken up

108
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,779
by the crops

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,430
to promote sustainable nitrogen

110
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,529
management we need to use systems

111
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,199
thinking that includes ecological and

112
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:28,479
evolutionary mechanisms as well as IRA

113
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,729
cultural knowledge we need to manage

114
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,069
nitrogen and carbon together and build

115
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,230
soil nutrient reserves so that crops can

116
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,269
take advantage of mechanisms developed

117
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,640
in the course of coevolution with

118
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:41,709
microbes this approach will lead to a

119
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,899
cascade of beneficial shifts in

120
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,289
agroecosystems

121
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:48,879
that support sustainable food production

122
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,400
organic certification rules need to be

123
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,829
modified to promote biological nitrogen

124
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,799
fixation is the primary nitrogen source

125
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:59,050
in organic systems the time is right to

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,000
begin weaning organic agriculture away

127
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,000
from haber-bosch nitrogen dependence
