1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,759
University um so I will talk about

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,198
reactive oxygen species and about stress

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,320
so I will basically talk first about raw

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,920
signaling then about stress combination

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,960
and then I will try to put these two

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,080
together Under the Umbrella of the one

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,640
word one Health uh

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:30,239
hypothesis uh so let's start uh talking

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,359
about reactive oxygen species so um I

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,159
listed some of them here they are partly

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,200
reduced or activated forms of oxygen uh

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,839
they byproducts of aerobic metabolism

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,320
and they can be toxic to cells

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,440
especially in the presence of iron this

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,719
is the the famous Infamous Fenton

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,280
reaction and most people think that Ross

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,640
are bad and back in the early 80s they

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,120
got a really bad reputation work from

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
Lester pecker and a lot of people were

21
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,038
taking a lot of antioxidants really

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,879
unneeded uh but anyway so in in recent

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,280
years we have a really a new view of

24
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:05,719
Ross is actually good and required for

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,118
life so if this

26
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,079
is depiction of the level of Ross in the

27
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,319
cell if the level of Ross will go too

28
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,759
low the cell will go into a cytostatic

29
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,118
state won't be able to do much if it's

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,438
too high will go into a cytotoxic state

31
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,560
that's oxidative stress but if you keep

32
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,438
Ross at the Redux biology range uh then

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,240
Ross and especially hydrogen peroxide

34
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,839
are very important signal struction

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,560
molecules they regulate protein

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,799
structure function by oxidative post

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,960
transational modification and they

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,920
regulate transcription Factor Kines

39
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,319
phosphatases channels and many other

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,840
proteins and regulate a lot of important

41
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,000
processes so how do you keep Ross in the

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,719
in the Redux biology range well this is

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,599
sort of the five principles I I remind

44
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,118
people hamsa five principles you control

45
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,078
the rate of production you control the

46
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,840
rate of Scavenging but you can also

47
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,199
control the rate of Transport because

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,200
you can transport hydrogen peroxide out

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,399
of different organel or even outside of

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,560
the cell you have to kilate free metals

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,800
and you have to constantly repair damage

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,598
so if you do all these five processes

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,840
all the time then Ross really are very

54
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,399
important signal transduction molecules

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,920
in the

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,840
cell okay so as we all know the plant

57
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,559
environment can be really Dynamic there

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,759
can be extreme changes in different

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,598
conditions I'm not going to go into all

60
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,239
this and to survive plants need to

61
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,159
acclimate and one of the things that do

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,519
to acclimate is systemic signaling uh

63
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,479
and systemic signaling is defined as the

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,239
ability of plant to mobilize a signal

65
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,238
from a small group of cells let's say

66
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,800
these cells that experience a signal or

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,239
a stress or a stimuli to the rest of the

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
plant and one this can be triggered by

69
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,719
different stimuli biotic abiotic once

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,200
this this signal reaches the systemic

71
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,680
tissue it will trigger acclimation I

72
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,639
will mainly talk about systemic acquired

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,920
acclimation but there is also systemic

74
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,119
acquired resistance systemic wound

75
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,958
response I will mention too um and this

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,759
has been studied

77
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,759
extensively uh a lot of longdistance

78
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,479
systemic signals are known uh hormones

79
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,679
electric signals calcium wave Ross wave

80
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,639
pH waves peptides whatever a lot of work

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,080
uh I'm summarizing in this slide and I

82
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,039
want to mention that they can be moving

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,239
from a leaf to to the choot or the root

84
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,679
from the root to whole shoot and so

85
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,640
forth so so uh I'm going to this talk

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,319
I'm going to focus primarily on the Ross

87
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,119
wave uh and this is the process that my

88
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,639
lab discovered in

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,560
2009 and what is the Ross wave it's

90
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,079
basically a cellto cell signaling

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,039
pathway uh in this pathway if a cell

92
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,959
starts making Ross the cell next to it

93
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,239
will sense it and start making Ross and

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,598
this will propagate like this throughout

95
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,400
the plant and um the reason I'm saying

96
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:59,039
autocatalytic is I can come centimeters

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,079
away from where I initiated it and I can

98
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,639
do it to do crafting experiment or put

99
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,280
an inhibitor and I can block it okay so

100
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,318
it's really really not diffusion and

101
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll talk a bit about this um and the

102
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:15,839
rate is about2 to.5 cm per minute and it

103
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,759
depends on enzymes called arbos

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,759
respiratory burst oxidase homologues in

105
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,120
leaf it's dnf equivalent of nox 5 in

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,319
Mamon these are plasma membrane protein

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,120
that use a an adph to make super oxide

108
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,038
in the apoplast and then then this

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,759
mutates to hydrogen peroxide so as I

110
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,519
said before this is not diffusion if

111
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,038
this is the local tissue and this is the

112
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,758
systemic rust are not made made in the

113
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,839
local and diffus all the way to the

114
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,400
systemic this is B basically almost

115
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,399
impossible because they will get

116
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,239
scavenged along the way um so this is

117
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,758
not a gradient this is not diffusion

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,879
what it is you can think of it as a

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,360
binary code okay a cell can be either at

120
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:59,800
a resting state a zero or an activated

121
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,639
State a high Ros producing okay uh and

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,400
when a cell sense like say this cell

123
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,038
will sense now that the cell preceding

124
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,239
it makes Ross it will start making Ross

125
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,319
and this will propagate like that okay

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,079
so Ross are not diffusing but what's

127
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,918
moving is information in the form of

128
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,839
altered Ross production from no or low

129
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,318
to high okay and so you can view it as

130
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,159
like a domino effect okay so all these

131
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,560
cells are already making Ross this is

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,319
the front of the wave and the next cell

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,038
will start making Ross now okay and and

134
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,879
these cells will start making Ross and

135
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,719
they will keep making Ross sometimes for

136
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,399
hours depend on the physiological

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,240
situation uh and and they will acclimate

138
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,239
to stress uh and we've done a lot of

139
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,840
studies about the Ross wave we found

140
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,600
that it it does a lot of different

141
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,879
things it coordinates many physiological

142
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,439
responses molecular metabolic it

143
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,600
integrates different I'm not going to

144
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:58,319
show all this it's required for a

145
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,520
clation I'll show two examples um and

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,080
this is an example of St matal responses

147
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,000
so I can take an arabidopsis plant and I

148
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,598
can shine light through a LED fiber

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,759
optic highlight or excess light on this

150
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,680
part of the leaf and the stomato will

151
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,479
close but it will also close within

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,478
minutes in a in a systemic Leaf okay and

153
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,719
it's not only one systemic Leaf if I do

154
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,839
it for example for this Leaf all these

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,280
leaves will close their stomata and if I

156
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,038
heat the leaf I give it a heat stress

157
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,758
all of them will open and this is

158
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,240
mediated by the Ross wave with without

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
the Ros wave you don't have that

160
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,120
response and it's sort of like the whole

161
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,719
plant to coordinate the response of the

162
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,639
whole plant it's like I tend to say it's

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
like a curl right how the all all the

164
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
cells are responding in unison so this

165
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,120
is an important role of the Ross wave

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,360
coordinating physiological responses

167
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,478
another experiment is shown here if I

168
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,240
take an arabidopsis plant and I shine

169
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,800
highlight only on this leaf and then I

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,800
do a transcriptomic analysis at zero two

171
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,240
uh four and eight minutes of this leaf

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,720
and a systemic leaf and I can see that

173
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,759
all together there is a very good

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
overlap because this is a systemic

175
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,000
response that will make this Leaf now

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,079
acclimated to highlight and I can then

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,879
take this Le this these transcripts at

178
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,359
the local and the systemic leaf and I

179
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,840
can do clustering to let's say these are

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,720
the transit Le in responding transcript

181
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,719
there is this overlap so I want you to

182
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,319
remember this number 2,300 okay look

183
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,680
what happened to this number if I do

184
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,120
this in a mutant that have a very

185
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,360
suppress Ross wave ARB almost no Ross

186
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,598
wave whatsoever it's very slow it goes

187
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,879
down to six okay so this is this Ross

188
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:42,240
wave is really important for

189
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,919
coordinating rapid responses okay you

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,720
still have an overlap uh but you don't

191
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,719
have aimation anymore and you don't have

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,159
rapid responses that are transmitted

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,319
from the local Leaf to the systemic

194
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:58,120
Leaf so when we uh discovered that we

195
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,158
used uh transgenic plants that has zwell

196
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,759
fluer the ZW from motor fuse to Lucifer

197
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,519
we didn't want to discover that we

198
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,879
wanted to develop a system where we can

199
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,680
screen from mutant that are deficient in

200
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,479
raw signaling but we discovered that

201
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,680
there is a systemic response uh but of

202
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,680
course this does not really measure Ross

203
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,240
okay uh so when I moved um six years ago

204
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,959
to Missouri I purchased this imager this

205
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,598
imager is used for Aon work it's called

206
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,680
ivis Lumina um and it's used to image is

207
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,918
very very sensitive it's used to image

208
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,000
you can inject for example G RFP labeled

209
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,360
cancer cells under the skin of a mice

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,839
and you can follow their migration okay

211
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,639
but we developed methods to uh image

212
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,200
whole plants live whole plants growing

213
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:48,360
in soil for Ross okay uh and this is

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,480
shown here for example these two plants

215
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,720
were treated with a d called DCF and the

216
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,200
trick is We Don't Spray we don't deep we

217
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,800
fumigate so we take nebulizers medical

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,800
nebulizers that create a mist it's like

219
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,120
a Mist we put the plants in this Mist

220
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,159
for half an hour they soak in the dye

221
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,000
whatever we want then we take them we

222
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,159
treat them we put them in the imager

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,759
okay I can talk more about this method

224
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,719
uh but essentially you can see then I

225
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,919
stimulate this leaf with highlight I can

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,160
see the Ross in a whole plant and these

227
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,879
again are plants just growing in soil uh

228
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,039
I can wound I can dip this Leaf in a

229
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,639
mixture of bacteria that will uh give a

230
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,958
hyper sensitive response and I will

231
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,078
immediately see a systemic cross wve uh

232
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,759
and here is a movie showing and this

233
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,719
Leaf was treated uh and you can see that

234
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,919
this leaf and the first Leaf two leaves

235
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,839
that have the best FL connection to it

236
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,958
will will light up first but then the

237
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,720
rest of the plant will light up and

238
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,639
always the treated Leaf behaves

239
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,600
differently than the other leaves well

240
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,958
because it was treated it was stressed

241
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,759
either wounded or subjected to highlight

242
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,000
so don't expect it to be like all the

243
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,120
other

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,240
tissues um we can use this for Imaging

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,679
and I'll show you of different types of

246
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,639
Ross so we use DCF for General Ross we

247
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,958
use peroxy orange one for hydrogen

248
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,000
peroxide we can use it for calcium

249
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,399
Imaging we can use it for membrane

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,958
potential Imaging uh and this the

251
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,799
advantage of this is we don't need to

252
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:20,319
transform the plant with uh ratiometric

253
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,919
or a gfp based uh anything we just

254
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
fumigate the plants and image them uh

255
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,120
and that's allows us to screen hundreds

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,079
of mutants now okay so that's really

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,278
Advantage but of course we always also

258
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,799
for some things use gcamp so we can

259
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,480
image with this imager calcium rif pp1

260
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,919
for hydrogen peroxide uh we can do that

261
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,560
too

262
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:46,240
okay so uh as I said we discovered the

263
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,599
the the Ross wave in 2009 and several

264
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,919
years later the labs of Tina romis and

265
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,040
Simon Giller discovered the calcium wave

266
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,199
I did not discover the calcium wave a

267
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,759
disclaimer uh and then we wrote a review

268
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,519
where we hypothesized how these things

269
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,078
you know work together and we thought

270
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,320
well arbo will make Ross Ross will make

271
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:08,319
calcium going to the cytool activate

272
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,680
cpks Fates arbo in this cell make Ross

273
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,600
change calcium here and therefore this

274
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,120
is how it will propagate from cell to

275
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,519
cell now that's a very nice story but we

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,159
have a lot of questions what calcium

277
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,320
what channels what's the role of

278
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,838
prismata and so forth so having this

279
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,278
imager Imaging meod developed we could

280
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,240
screen we screen over 100 200 mutants uh

281
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,200
just showing you brief examples so this

282
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,159
is like cngc2 in response to highlight

283
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,720
stress this is while type these are two

284
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,319
independent mutant of cngc2 and you can

285
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,320
see of course there is no response right

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,200
uh this is the glr 3.3 3.6 in response

287
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,560
to highlight you have a suppress Ross

288
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,879
wave response to winding you have no Ros

289
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,278
wave so you can start dissecting this

290
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,360
okay I'm making a very long story of

291
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,958
several years of work short this is the

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,079
model where we are now uh we know that

293
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,078
stress will
