1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:11,958
thanks Eric it's a pleasure to be here

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,629
and I'm gonna be talking today about how

5
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:17,509
best opportunities aren't found in other

6
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:19,670
words your career isn't put on a silver

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,939
platter for you but rather they're made

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,850
so the onus is on you to own your career

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,710
and we want to empower you to have the

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,390
tools so that you can be successful no

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,628
matter where you end up whether it's in

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,058
academia or somewhere beyond so let's

13
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:38,030
start with a little challenge since the

14
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:39,768
1980s the cumulative number of faculty

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,629
positions has remained relatively

16
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:44,238
constant as you can see in this orange

17
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:46,358
line at the bottom whereas the number of

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,858
PhDs awarded has been rising steadily

19
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,198
yet unemployment for PhDs in the

20
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:53,569
sciences and engineering fields is less

21
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:58,030
than the national average at about 4

22
00:00:53,569 --> 00:01:00,710
percent so where does everybody end up

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,719
the American Society for cell biology

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,058
brought together several sources to

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,820
create this infographic for biology PhDs

26
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:11,658
that reveals faculty job is actually one

27
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:14,529
of the alternative careers PhDs are

28
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,479
successful in industry and government

29
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:21,530
research science related and non science

30
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:25,340
jobs about 30% are estimated to not do a

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,460
postdoc and about 30% do a second

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,789
postdoc for an average nationally of

33
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:33,978
about four years so the numbers don't

34
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:36,739
quite add up because it's really hard to

35
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:38,840
track information reliably on

36
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:41,539
internationals or on all postdocs in

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,460
general and these numbers were largely

38
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:46,399
based on the NIH biomedical workforce

39
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:51,288
working group which then identified an

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,868
opportunity to address this and as a

41
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:56,390
result they developed the best awards

42
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:58,578
for broadening experiences in scientific

43
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,649
training the goal is to develop

44
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:02,118
innovative approaches that complement

45
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:05,329
traditional research training in the

46
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:10,460
biomedical sciences so these awards were

47
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:13,370
given to now 17 institutions their

48
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,790
experimental awards funded by the NIH

49
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,560
Common Fund program office which is out

50
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:20,289
of the office of the director Francis

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,908
Collins

52
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:26,139
and Cornell is just one of the

53
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:28,359
consortium members that meet monthly via

54
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:31,359
teleconference and several times a year

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,159
in person to share best practices so

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,069
each institution has a different model

57
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:38,109
of how they run their best programs some

58
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:40,238
are working with small cohorts of 10 to

59
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,799
20 students a year and they all go

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,420
through the exact same programming and

61
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,370
at the end they get a best certificate

62
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:48,098
and they're ready for their job and at

63
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,709
Cornell we have a very different model

64
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:53,259
where it's kind of a smorgasbord where

65
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,930
you'll you'll learn more about what we

66
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:58,060
offer but it's much more inclusive some

67
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,090
like Wayne State offer programming that

68
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,348
includes the humanities and Social

69
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,378
Sciences as well so Cornell's best

70
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:10,568
program is focused on all STEM PhDs and

71
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:12,429
postdocs thanks to the additional

72
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:14,919
support of the Graduate School and the

73
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,349
colleges of Ag and life sciences arts

74
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:20,318
and sciences engineering human ecology

75
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:22,209
and veterinary medicine we enhance

76
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,839
opportunities to help trainees prepare

77
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,579
for their future careers so for alumni

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,039
historically what are those careers

79
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:34,090
especially for life scientists like you

80
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:39,698
at Cornell so the good news is they're

81
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:44,109
virtually all employed so two to five

82
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:47,109
years after PhD conferral about 30% are

83
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,120
in postdocs and two-thirds are employed

84
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:53,889
in positions other than postdoctoral

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:58,719
training with that percentage going to

86
00:03:53,889 --> 00:04:01,000
94% when we survey Cornell alum PhD

87
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,019
alumni seven to twenty years out from

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,408
their degree so when we look at the

89
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:12,549
types of employers overall other than in

90
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:16,569
a postdoc about half end up in the

91
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:20,288
education sector in red here and a third

92
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:23,168
in the private sector or this green part

93
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:27,339
of the brain and about 10% end up in

94
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:30,519
government when we survey Cornell

95
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:33,318
doctoral alumni 44% shown here in the

96
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,568
blue graph at the beginning

97
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,460
seven to twenty years out from their PhD

98
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,789
report to be employed in four-year

99
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:42,528
colleges and universities or their

100
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:45,110
affiliated research institution about a

101
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:47,028
fifth are in industry but they're

102
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,908
employed at nonprofits foreign

103
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:53,598
educational institutions the US

104
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:57,558
government and so on in green you see

105
00:04:53,598 --> 00:05:00,908
alumni two to five years post degree

106
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:04,669
when we're excluding the postdocs

107
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:07,038
they're the greatest shift we see is in

108
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:10,868
the is in employment in the industry

109
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:14,438
sector but we see an increasing

110
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:17,479
diversity in other forms of employment

111
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,399
either they're self-employed they're in

112
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:22,068
foreign governments they're in medical

113
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,528
schools or centers there might be in K

114
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:29,899
through 12 schools or community colleges

115
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:32,418
so if we look at the types of employers

116
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:34,939
and we just focus on the education

117
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:39,128
sector up here in red the great majority

118
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:43,249
are at four-year institutions

119
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:49,639
domestically and about 17% are in a

120
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:52,879
foreign institution so collectively they

121
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,288
are predominantly in various stages of

122
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:59,449
the tenure-track process as assistants

123
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:04,728
associates or full professors here in

124
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:09,080
green for alumni in the government

125
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:11,418
sector here in gold if we break it out

126
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,848
we see them the great majority seventy

127
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:17,740
one percent are at the federal level

128
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:20,718
domestically and maybe 22 percent in the

129
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,490
non-us government with six and a half

130
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:27,168
percent ending up in the state

131
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:32,439
government when we look at the industry

132
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:35,418
and nonprofit sector

133
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:39,709
the majority are in industry and 18

134
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:42,228
percent end up at nonprofits so with

135
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:44,478
this diversity of career outcomes for

136
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:46,639
Cornell alumni is really no surprise

137
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,029
that current PhDs and postdocs are all

138
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,389
started

139
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:54,289
interested in learning about all of the

140
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:58,370
possibilities the best brokest best

141
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:02,330
program focuses on four main career

142
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,160
tracks that fill the gap between the

143
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:07,099
excellent existing support that's here

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,290
on campus for teaching excellence and

145
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,020
academic research training including

146
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,700
careers in science communication so for

147
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,009
instance if you want to become a journal

148
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:20,199
editor or a science writer or a museum

149
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:26,539
director for example in science policy

150
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:29,329
so this this can encompasses both if you

151
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,370
want to be in creating policy to

152
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:34,539
regulate science or on the other side

153
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,389
for scientists who might want to

154
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,640
contribute to the policy-making aspect

155
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:42,319
also governance risk and compliance for

156
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,719
those who might consider becoming a

157
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,819
funding agency program officer or a head

158
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,520
of biosafety or an intellectual property

159
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:52,639
manager and Industry entrepreneurship

160
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:57,469
and management obviously there's overlap

161
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,419
between a lot of these buckets and this

162
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,190
is reflected by the interests of the

163
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,660
best program participants which I'll

164
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:07,839
share with you later so how do you get

165
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,310
involved and why are people interested

166
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,399
well they get involved to become a

167
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,439
besties first by going to our website

168
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,469
they fill out a short application about

169
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,660
what their career objectives are on we

170
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,400
schedule an individual consultation to

171
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,860
personalize the program to your

172
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,859
individual needs we invite you to come

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,139
to events join the cornell best linkedin

174
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,610
group or even hired a photographer to

175
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,970
come to take a nice professional

176
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,820
headshot if you want to improve your

177
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,920
LinkedIn profile somewhat you can work

178
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,210
on an individual development plan either

179
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,009
start one or if you've already got one

180
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:47,060
maybe it's a good time to review that

181
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:50,230
and the key point is to include your

182
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,009
professor your advisors in the

183
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,220
conversations that you're having about

184
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:56,659
your plans so that that can be

185
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,500
accomplished alongside of your research

186
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:00,480
objectives

187
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,429
so the more you know about your own

188
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,080
values and where you'd like to explore

189
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:06,000
the better we can tailor the program to

190
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,720
your individual needs so self

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,179
exploration really is key so from the

192
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,450
application besties express the most

193
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,039
interest in industry entrepreneurship

194
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,950
and management I mean it's a big bucket

195
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,719
to so here at the bottom you see 28%

196
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,730
have checked that off but a large

197
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,129
proportion are interested in a

198
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,230
combination of often involving science

199
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:31,279
communication and many just want to

200
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,590
learn about all the different tracks to

201
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,350
see what career possibilities are geared

202
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,330
toward phd's so two-thirds of the

203
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,670
applicants are actually in the life

204
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,009
sciences with about a third also in the

205
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:46,439
physical sciences and we have open door

206
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:48,389
programming so we often have people from

207
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,820
the social sciences and humanities join

208
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,860
us as well even though that's not our

209
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,840
focus

210
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:59,940
so they come from over 60 departments

211
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:02,040
across campus and and fields and of our

212
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,980
most active trainees compared to campus

213
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,079
totals proportionally fewer are postdocs

214
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,550
probably because if they come to a

215
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,320
research one institution they probably

216
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:12,509
want to become a tenure-track academic

217
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,990
professor and are set on their training

218
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:21,029
and proportionally more self-identifies

219
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:24,899
underrepresented minorities so our reach

220
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:27,769
as I said really extends beyond doctoral

221
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,990
students which are our folks I'm sorry

222
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:33,870
which are our folk that which are the

223
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,299
focus of our program and postdocs as

224
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,169
well we often have master students

225
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:43,979
undergrads and other people like staff

226
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:47,219
and faculty attend our programming by

227
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:52,529
college we have participation across the

228
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:55,980
disciplines with 40% coming from

229
00:10:52,529 --> 00:11:00,539
engineering 30% roughly from Cal's and

230
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,759
and so on in the different sectors so

231
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,389
some hallmarks and now that you know a

232
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,710
little bit about our participants we we

233
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,199
kind of want to tell you what our

234
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,850
program actually offers so we actually

235
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,709
begin by reminding

236
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,300
everyone that your primary objective is

237
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,068
really to have a successful PhD

238
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,899
concentrate on your research and your

239
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:21,838
publications we don't want to distract

240
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,139
you from that most important job you

241
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:30,540
have here as a doctoral student or a

242
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:32,068
postdoc however with that in mind we

243
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,469
don't have any fixed requirements

244
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:36,299
because we know you're busy and we're

245
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,370
ready for you are to take advantage of

246
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,419
the program that we have when it's

247
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,990
convenient for you

248
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:45,179
so if you're right before your thesis

249
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,490
writing or before your a exam we don't

250
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,469
recommend you participate we'll catch

251
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,028
you up at a different time

252
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,649
so aside from filling out our

253
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:54,870
application which takes about 10 minutes

254
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,179
you can come to any events by choice

255
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,740
meet with program staff to learn how the

256
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,120
program could be customized to your

257
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,698
individual needs so whether you're a

258
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,560
first year grad student or a month away

259
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:07,019
from the end of your postdoc you can

260
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,229
come join in and tangibly benefit from

261
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,240
the professional development resources

262
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,339
so some of our participants haven't

263
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,259
really thought yet about considering

264
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,639
anything beyond academia or are

265
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,039
unfamiliar with the many options

266
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,688
available to them so at this stage we

267
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,849
provide exposure to the variety of

268
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:26,278
career outcomes to which PhDs are well

269
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,139
suited we share resources for specific

270
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,789
information to learn more about the

271
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,980
skills needed in a particular career

272
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:34,528
path and we guide activities that will

273
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,180
help rule in or rule out because we're

274
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:38,879
really agnostic as to what the career

275
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,649
outcome is we help you rule in or rule

276
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,289
out a particular option to help decide

277
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:47,448
whether the pros and cons mesh with your

278
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:51,838
individual objectives so at this stage

279
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:54,179
you might want to come to career panel

280
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,579
discussion on science communication or

281
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:59,669
other areas to hear how recent alumni

282
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,559
have transitioned from academia and what

283
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:06,028
they like most and least about their

284
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:08,489
jobs or about how they got there what

285
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:13,078
their path was you'll hear their

286
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:15,930
perspectives of firsthand and we often

287
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:19,620
have experienced managers share what

288
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:21,179
they most value in new PhD hires so it's

289
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,850
a chance for you to broaden your network

290
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,709
not just with alumni but with

291
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,730
like-minded colleagues from across camp

292
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,639
this in different disciplines so you

293
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,379
might want to go to for instance an

294
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,399
advancing science and policy club

295
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:42,320
meeting to learn more about what's

296
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:47,209
involved in connecting with policymaking

297
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,800
we've designed special gap-filling

298
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,519
courses and workshops to address needs

299
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:58,409
that aren't covered on campus so for

300
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,449
instance we have created what started

301
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,699
out as a workshop as a business as a

302
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,500
second language it's now a full-blown

303
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,150
course called business and management

304
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,029
fundamentals so you can learn more about

305
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:12,959
the business side of science which might

306
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:17,819
help you in academia as well so we

307
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:21,680
encourage you to get involved by going

308
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:25,830
to our website sign up for a lift serve

309
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,229
take the time to learn how we can be

310
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,030
used as a springboard for other

311
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,100
resources that are available to you

312
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,079
sometimes it's just a matter of learning

313
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,899
about where those resources exist

314
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,870
because we don't reinvent programming

315
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,759
for teaching or for entrepreneurship for

316
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,769
the most part because those resources

317
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,769
are really well developed across campus

318
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:56,909
so the key point of our program is

319
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:59,220
really that it's more about doing we

320
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:02,459
want you to apply what you learn and

321
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,470
write it on your resume so we can help

322
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,570
design and empower you to create an

323
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,639
experience that's customized to your

324
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,760
needs and might help others along the

325
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,649
way you have similar interests and we

326
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,189
hope that these experiences result in a

327
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:20,220
rule in or rule out that's okay to

328
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:22,080
decision and end up having you actively

329
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,910
acquire the skills that will set your

330
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,780
resume apart from all the other PhD

331
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:30,179
applicants so the second level of

332
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,549
participation for those who may be there

333
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:36,750
post a exam or they have a little more

334
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:38,699
time we we can help plan to prioritize

335
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,600
more experiential opportunities to try

336
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,790
on the particular

337
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
career learn firsthand whether it suits

338
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:45,208
you and to learn how to describe your

339
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,328
research in a way that will resonate

340
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:50,489
with the future employer so we hope that

341
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:52,559
each experience results in something you

342
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,970
can write on your resume to say not only

343
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,698
am i interested in science communication

344
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,528
but here's the lay article I wrote or

345
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:01,379
here's the blog I started or here's the

346
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:04,230
op-ed piece that that I contributed to

347
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,600
to affect policy or something along

348
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,490
those lines and we want you to be able

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,560
to say okay I've done that and then use

350
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,500
that experience when you're in an

351
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,750
interview situation to show that you you

352
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:20,009
have drawn from experience rather than

353
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,958
theoretical knowledge so how do we do

354
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,209
that I already mentioned some courses

355
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,679
you can take I mean there are over 70

356
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,979
courses across Cornell in

357
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,849
entrepreneurship alone one of our best

358
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,050
days is actually team piaying the

359
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,420
technology commercialization course

360
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:38,250
that's coming up I encourage you if

361
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:42,539
you're interested in that area to sign

362
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:45,089
up but we curate actually probably the

363
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,219
eight or ten entrepreneurial courses

364
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,050
that are open to PhDs and postdocs they

365
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,269
welcome scientists and engineers in

366
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,188
their classes to mingle with business

367
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:57,120
students and so we can save you some

368
00:16:53,188 --> 00:17:00,328
time and perusing big long lists we have

369
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,659
offered certificates in Lean Six Sigma

370
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:06,058
thinking in by pharmaceutical regulatory

371
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:10,318
affairs and good clinical practices and

372
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:12,750
there you have a certificate on on your

373
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,449
resume that shows not just that you're

374
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,220
an expert in FDA regulations but at

375
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,038
least you're taking the active steps to

376
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,169
say you want to become more aware of the

377
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:25,349
regulatory path in industry for instance

378
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:28,020
so many people have entered business

379
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:30,839
plans they've participated in the three

380
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,720
minute thesis competition they've

381
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,339
successfully applied for internal seed

382
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,759
grants either through the Center for

383
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:40,889
Advanced Technology through statewide

384
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,599
Clean Energy grants or even through

385
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,080
federal programs for Small Business

386
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,058
Innovation research some have we have

387
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,649
two company start ups already from

388
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:51,720
besties

389
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,330
we have people invite speakers to

390
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,589
symposium like Eric did

391
00:17:54,329 --> 00:18:00,149
and you you can be recommended I'm sorry

392
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:02,669
to be a speaker at an industry

393
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,370
conference yourself or moderate a career

394
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,710
panel that the best program puts on to

395
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:10,489
give you that leadership experience many

396
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,410
have gone on to either shape New York

397
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,269
legislations to have their policy brief

398
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,060
included in the clean energy bill passed

399
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:21,119
by the New York State Senate and we want

400
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:25,349
you to think creatively and flexibly

401
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:27,209
about internship experiences so we call

402
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:30,929
them best earn ships because we want to

403
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:34,440
get out of the mindset of what an

404
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,180
internship is that's typically 10 to 12

405
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,789
weeks full-time over the summer for an

406
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,340
undergrad phd's can really add value

407
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,220
over a longer term maybe perhaps

408
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,529
remotely and using the research skills

409
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,589
that you're developing during your

410
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:53,009
thesis work in your postdoctoral work so

411
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:55,769
key findings are that we want to be

412
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:57,779
flexible so for instance if you want to

413
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,879
stay in the lab and don't want to travel

414
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,250
off campus there are many existing

415
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,420
opportunities with within Cornell for

416
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,849
instance and the Environmental Health

417
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,070
and Safety Unit or in the licensing

418
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:10,889
office we've had bestie's embedded there

419
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:12,450
where they're on site sometimes but when

420
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,790
they have a lab experiment to go they go

421
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,549
back to the lab and they contribute

422
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:23,460
remotely in their own time doing market

423
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:26,669
research doing lab inspections as by a

424
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,850
safety officer for instance we have had

425
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:32,100
people arrange with their advisers to to

426
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,559
work off-campus two days a week for

427
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,589
instance at a venture capital investment

428
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,079
for accel partners to become a venture

429
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:42,679
analyst so that's kind of an unusual

430
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:47,429
path but it was personalized for this

431
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,950
individuals career goals we've had ones

432
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:53,220
who worked developing their own

433
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,740
technology with a startup firm in

434
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,850
Binghamton to implement their research

435
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,490
at a food science company we've had ones

436
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:04,679
who have used the time between their

437
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,808
thesis defense and their actual degree

438
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,870
conferral to

439
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:12,808
you a real internship a more classical

440
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:14,548
internship but for PhDs and this person

441
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:16,648
happened to be from Luxembourg and is

442
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:19,230
now fully employed at Bain as a

443
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:21,928
consultant so it was a way not only for

444
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,940
the company to check out his experience

445
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,798
but also for him to interview the

446
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,538
company to see if that's really where he

447
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:31,980
wanted to end up we've had students

448
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:35,128
participate a longer term with their

449
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,169
advisors consent and approval for

450
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:40,888
instance at a strategic analysis firm in

451
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,649
Washington DC where this student looked

452
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:45,719
at the regulations and perceptions

453
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:48,859
around gain-of-function studies for that

454
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,808
affected that moratorium on pathogenic

455
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:54,888
organism research and as a result of

456
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:58,950
that work the moratorium was lifted and

457
00:20:54,888 --> 00:21:01,528
he contributed to that process others

458
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,830
have actually spent a greater amounts of

459
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:07,528
time at a large Pharma this is not usual

460
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:08,878
but this is to express the range of

461
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:12,200
possibilities that people have

462
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:15,569
successfully done and this student just

463
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,639
completed his PhD and realized that

464
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:19,678
maybe he doesn't want to go to that

465
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:20,248
biopharma company is gonna be working at

466
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,690
another one

467
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:26,940
so sometimes unexpected outcomes and you

468
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,649
know better you do that now while you're

469
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,720
doing your PhD and you might save

470
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:36,628
yourself some time later so we're trying

471
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,730
to start to change the culture we build

472
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,709
on existing seminar series to get a

473
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,610
captive audience in the room to spread

474
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,288
the word we encourage students to

475
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:49,168
suggest speakers who come from beyond

476
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:51,778
academia to come and speak within their

477
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:53,549
seminar series and as if that's the case

478
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:55,349
the best program will fund half the cost

479
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:57,690
of the travel and so it's a nice

480
00:21:55,349 --> 00:22:02,308
incentive for departments to be open to

481
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:05,249
that so I'll share a few example

482
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:07,499
outcomes created by best trainees not to

483
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:09,118
say this is what we do but to get the

484
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:11,249
creative juices flowing so that you

485
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:14,278
might be inspired for what you might

486
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:17,159
want to do so for industry

487
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:19,138
entrepreneurship and management the best

488
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,740
program funded a postdoc to attend a

489
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:23,048
precede workshop which happened to be

490
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,019
happening in Rochester because his

491
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:28,028
technology was ready earlier than the

492
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,460
precede workshop that was happening here

493
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:32,589
on campus to evaluate the commercial

494
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,649
potential of his clean tech idea the

495
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:38,230
precede workshop is a team-oriented

496
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:40,239
hand-picked team that is made up of a

497
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,899
tech transfer officer a licensing

498
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,750
executive a seasoned entrepreneur a

499
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:48,250
facilitator and coach to walk them

500
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,859
through the 20 questions they need to

501
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,480
ask before investing another 10,000

502
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:54,729
hours to see if that technology is worth

503
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,528
commercializing and by the way only one

504
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,069
of those questions concerns the

505
00:22:56,528 --> 00:23:02,470
technological aspects of it so it's very

506
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:04,569
important for that idea to go forward to

507
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,610
really consider you know is anybody

508
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:09,428
gonna buy the product it doesn't solve

509
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:10,928
any problems who are the competitors how

510
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,399
are you going to set up your team where

511
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,070
are you gonna get your funding and so on

512
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:17,639
so as a result of best referrals and

513
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:20,019
networking at this pre-state workshop

514
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,990
this post I actually assembled a

515
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:25,359
business team to complement complement

516
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,690
his scientific expertise and together

517
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:32,319
they applied for and were awarded a New

518
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:35,230
York State Energy grant to talk to their

519
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,898
first 40 potential customers and get

520
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,909
feedback before they even develop their

521
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:42,548
prototype to see whether it would be

522
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:45,429
worthwhile moving forward they decided

523
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:48,099
yes it was and an equally good outcome

524
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:52,120
would have been no it isn't and that's

525
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:54,490
also a success in our eyes and they

526
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,798
actually started the company and they're

527
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,990
calling it eco electro and have since

528
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,298
won an Small Business Innovation

529
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,929
research grant to move forward on this

530
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,908
technology

531
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:08,620
he's now full-time with the company so

532
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:12,220
that's his path so key elements of these

533
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:14,709
stories are always that it includes good

534
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,130
mentoring and your advisor might not be

535
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,319
your only mentor many times faculty are

536
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,600
here because they love academia and

537
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,879
might not have experience in other

538
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,730
fields so we want to connect you with

539
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,000
multiple mentors there's a little S at

540
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,069
the end here in red from the field of

541
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,390
your career aspiration who might meet

542
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,039
with you regularly

543
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,930
encourage you to stay on track and help

544
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,180
you succeed in your career of choice I

545
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,600
should note that we do not assign

546
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,610
mentors that should be a process where

547
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,799
you have a good chemistry with someone

548
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:52,029
who gives you advice and so we don't

549
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:55,119
want to interfere with your process so

550
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:57,819
in the science policy track which is

551
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,279
spearheaded by Chris Shaffer who's the

552
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:04,809
COPE principle investigator on this best

553
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,639
grant he actually took a sabbatical year

554
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:09,849
to be a Science and Technology Policy

555
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,830
fellow himself in senator marques office

556
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:14,139
and came back with the message that

557
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:16,899
scientists and engineers are by far the

558
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,970
worst storytellers ever and so he

559
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,700
developed a course called the science

560
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,759
policy boot camp from concept to

561
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,150
conclusion which now has had several

562
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:31,000
it's a team oriented class that has had

563
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,120
several iterations now where there are

564
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,599
tangible projects where teams from

565
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,579
different areas of scientific and

566
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:46,299
non-scientific disciplines get together

567
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:48,519
to create an outcome that will address

568
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:52,869
their passion so for instance there were

569
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,009
a couple of students who thought that it

570
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:57,369
was really important to teach

571
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:59,259
algorithmic thinking early on not in the

572
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:02,769
first coding class that you get as an

573
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:05,799
undergraduate and so they developed with

574
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:08,109
a local elementary school principal they

575
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,889
developed a grant got outside funding

576
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:17,169
and deployed this code for kids program

577
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:20,470
to 120 second through sixth graders to

578
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:23,160
improve their algorithmic thinking so

579
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,779
they're making a difference locally on

580
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,090
another group I mentioned the advancing

581
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:31,059
science and policy graduate student

582
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:33,549
organization has developed a bring a

583
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,429
politician to work and they've already

584
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:39,159
had several sessions where they invent

585
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:41,230
invited if it mayor sponte myrick to

586
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,000
come in they toured a various labs here

587
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:48,569
he is in a child cognition lab in Maya

588
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,630
cuz a justice all Islam

589
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:55,109
we're actually a child was teaching him

590
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:57,120
how to do the experiment so it was a fun

591
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,668
event he toured several other labs

592
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:04,018
including an imaging lab and so on and

593
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:05,370
then had a group discussion with grad

594
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,679
students and postdocs who might be

595
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,908
interested in seeing how politicians

596
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,519
actually get their scientific

597
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:14,130
information to inform their policies we

598
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,750
also had Barbara Lipton come in and she

599
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:19,500
also did the same kind of thing where

600
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:22,980
she toured several labs and it's a it's

601
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,500
a great way to hear firsthand how you

602
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,808
can describe your research to someone

603
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,359
who might have last had math in high

604
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:32,339
school for instance so it's a different

605
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:37,048
way of thinking about how you describe

606
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:39,720
your work and these these aspects of

607
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:41,668
communication will help you if you're

608
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,679
going to teach an undergraduate class or

609
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:47,639
if you're going to mentor another

610
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,309
postdoc in your lab so in the science

611
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:52,648
communication area we've had an example

612
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:54,388
where best trainee was paired with a

613
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:56,939
science communication professional to

614
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:58,558
hone her skills in writing a press

615
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,659
release she learned how to conduct

616
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,569
interviews sometimes it's really hard to

617
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,950
get scientists and engineers to talk

618
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:06,359
cogently about their research in a way

619
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,659
that's going to interest the broader

620
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,428
public so she actually worked on the

621
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,929
structure and mechanics of writing a

622
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,059
piece like that which is very different

623
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:17,700
from a scientific paper learned about

624
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:22,500
the editing process as she sent in her

625
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,149
article to the Chronicle and had several

626
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,148
articles published

627
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:29,009
she helped co-organized with a team of

628
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:30,479
other people comm saikhan and

629
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,269
communicating science conference which

630
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,389
now is in its third year at Cornell

631
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:40,349
entirely student-run they learn all

632
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:43,199
about event planning and rallying the

633
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:45,298
resources needed and Priscilla tizen

634
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,179
about a grand idea that you might want

635
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:50,548
to to move your agenda forward and

636
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,990
that's not unlike what faculty do every

637
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:53,829
day when they have new ideas they want

638
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,259
to implement

639
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:57,908
so she's actually communicated in a

640
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:02,110
communication role she's about to start

641
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:04,299
that role now so lessons learned are

642
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:06,908
that flexibility and customization is

643
00:29:04,298 --> 00:29:10,179
essential but is very hard to scale so

644
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:13,629
that's our problem but it's a good

645
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:15,820
success we think sorry this should be

646
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:17,558
faculty buy-in faculty buy-in is very

647
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:20,109
important and we want you to have

648
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,579
conversations with your advisor you

649
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:23,678
might just have a perception that

650
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:26,918
they're not receptive to you going into

651
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,629
another career our programming

652
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:33,609
assessment really helps prune less

653
00:29:28,628 --> 00:29:36,608
successful ideas and we always look at

654
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:38,288
the evaluations to help inform future

655
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,819
participants and we've stopped doing

656
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:42,368
things all together when we've had bad

657
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:44,579
reviews so thanks for filling out any

658
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:47,858
surveys that you might have been doing

659
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:50,918
so again we emphasize a primary

660
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:54,519
objective is to complete your degree we

661
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:58,809
do meet with faculty as needed to

662
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,210
address questions perceptions and we do

663
00:29:58,808 --> 00:30:03,308
discontinue best privileges if if we

664
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:07,720
hear that there's been inadequate

665
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:09,308
academic progress we collaborate very

666
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,470
heavily across units because we're a

667
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,148
very small office and so we have

668
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,629
connections in the Graduate School

669
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:18,388
Career Services alumni affairs we work

670
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:20,709
closely with the office of postdoctoral

671
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:23,528
studies and various student

672
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:27,100
organizations and professional

673
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:29,669
organizations on and off campus as I

674
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:33,998
said we try to identify gaps and and

675
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:34,899
coordinate to fill those in so best is

676
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,440
not for everyone

677
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:40,178
and that's fine and we'd like to

678
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,179
concentrate on sharing the positive

679
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:45,609
messages and not Express a doom and

680
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:49,929
gloom attitude of how difficult it is to

681
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:52,720
get one particular career or another

682
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:54,730
because frankly any career you go into

683
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,480
you have to be passionate and you have

684
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:01,239
to be willing to work hard so that's

685
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,278
kind of our message we have an advisory

686
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:05,180
board that's made up exclusively of grad

687
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,819
students and postdocs

688
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,029
and they're really integral in shaping

689
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:14,569
our program and in event planning and

690
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:18,200
outreach to other participants across

691
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:21,700
campus we're at an adaptable program our

692
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,830
vision and components are flexible and

693
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,250
we have some challenges in evaluation

694
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:30,799
because the NIH is very concerned about

695
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:33,829
time to degree which might or might not

696
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,379
be the right question to ask because we

697
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:38,659
think that if you spend two months let's

698
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,400
say in an internship and find out that

699
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,320
maybe you don't need to do it three-year

700
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,500
postdoc you will have saved some time

701
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,619
long term so we'd like to engage in

702
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,259
those conversations whether they're

703
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:54,139
politically correct right now or not

704
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:58,309
we're very inclusive and we would like

705
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:00,290
to imagine persisting outcomes we're in

706
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:02,480
now our fourth year of a five-year grant

707
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:03,859
so we have two more years left and at

708
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,990
the end of that we're expected to be

709
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,639
institutionalized so the best of our

710
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,160
best practices we hope will be

711
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,520
incorporated so that's already happening

712
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,170
we have courses that are happening

713
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,579
there's a physics course on science

714
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,690
communication that incorporates

715
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:23,029
theatrical and Performing Arts aspects

716
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,670
into how you engage your audience in

717
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,230
those first 10 minutes of your talk

718
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,560
we've developed workshops and

719
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:33,559
certificate programs that are continuing

720
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:36,529
we involve PhDs in programs that prior

721
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,990
to the best program involvement they

722
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:41,119
were not eligible for friend says

723
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,250
internships at small life sciences

724
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,599
companies and we hope to be developing a

725
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,920
new paradigm for PhD training whereas

726
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,750
previously it was thought that your

727
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,029
faculty member should mentor you

728
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,670
throughout your PhD which would of

729
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:58,160
course lead to a postdoc and probably an

730
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,870
academic career unless you've kind of

731
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,880
fell by the wayside somewhere else and

732
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:04,519
ended up finding your own way in some

733
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,710
other career so instead the consortium

734
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,650
which has published this and the fasiq

735
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,660
journal just a few years ago would like

736
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,640
to think more about your scientific and

737
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,380
research training to incorporate career

738
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,720
and professional development throughout

739
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,740
the time that you're doing your PhD such

740
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,870
that you can decide

741
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,569
whether a postdoc is good for you or not

742
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:27,349
and to help you be successful in any

743
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:30,049
career that you decide to pursue so in

744
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:32,719
fact we have researchers on campus mic

745
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:35,869
roaches in the dyson school and he

746
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,140
partnered with Henry Sherman to publish

747
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:41,449
the science paper recently that actually

748
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,580
showed that yes if you're going into an

749
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,120
academic career as a tenure track

750
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:46,399
professor

751
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,949
you probably will have a postdoc and

752
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,370
you'll need it however if you're going

753
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:56,230
into an industry career or into an

754
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:59,299
academic non research position actually

755
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:01,700
it might be a financial loss to you if

756
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:03,169
you want to go into that career and so

757
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,200
you should really think about that and

758
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:08,869
think carefully about the skills you

759
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,090
want to acquire during your postdoc such

760
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:15,379
that they will get you better prepared

761
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:16,909
for where you want to end up so what are

762
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:19,819
the career aspirations of our best

763
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,550
trainees well we compare when you began

764
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,230
your PhD in the light gray here the

765
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,850
majority think they want to become

766
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,199
tenure-track faculty maybe they haven't

767
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,929
even thought about it they just assumed

768
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,168
that was the where they wanted to go

769
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:35,780
however when we asked them how about now

770
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:37,898
we find the biggest shift is in other

771
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,940
areas such as consulting

772
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:45,019
entrepreneurship and communication

773
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:47,539
careers so we hope to empower you to own

774
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:50,210
your own career and to be successful

775
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:52,398
wherever you're going to end up here's

776
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,550
my contact information I want to thank

777
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,529
the principle investigator of the grant

778
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,740
Avery August he's a faculty member in

779
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:03,530
immunology and infectious disease in the

780
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:05,709
vet school the co P I is John Parker

781
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,300
he's in virology at the Baker Institute

782
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,858
and of copia I mentioned Chris Shaffer

783
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,380
he's a professor in biomedical

784
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:14,299
engineering on Suzi var be honest and

785
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,820
please contact me if you'd like to have

786
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,800
more information thank you for your time

787
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:23,650
I'll entertain questions both from here

788
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,650
and from Geneva there are any

789
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,329
[Applause]

790
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:49,260
yeah so um there are there is tracking

791
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:52,858
of Cornell alumni that go on to further

792
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,109
career degrees so we consider that still

793
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,659
in training so if they go to medical

794
00:35:55,108 --> 00:36:00,328
school or law school for instance or

795
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:03,239
they go on for another master's let's

796
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:05,280
say in public health after their PhD we

797
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,979
didn't include those statistics in the

798
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:31,559
outcomes but certainly those we have

799
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:34,530
examples of those so the question is if

800
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:38,519
you go on to a non tenure-track position

801
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:45,839
that are still in academia presumably

802
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:48,059
like where where are they right right so

803
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,338
they might be an academic research still

804
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:52,470
or they might be a core facility

805
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:54,750
director I mean we have PhDs here at

806
00:36:52,469 --> 00:37:00,298
Cornell who run the genomics facilities

807
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:04,199
imaging facilities and so on so people

808
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:06,599
without phd's we we have not tracked

809
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:09,449
them here because our program is

810
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,568
dictated by the NIH to focus on PhD

811
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:15,269
recipients because many people like me

812
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:19,079
leave with their masters and they have

813
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:22,650
fulfilling careers but usually master's

814
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:26,609
programs or people who exit with their

815
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,710
masters from a ph.d program so that the

816
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:31,259
master's degree programs usually are

817
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,960
well served in their career objectives

818
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,270
in fact on day one they're told to go to

819
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,970
the career fair for instance so it's a

820
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:40,170
compressed

821
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:42,848
his very job oriented those who decide

822
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,190
they started with a ph.d program and

823
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,920
decided to leave with a master's that's

824
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,740
a different situation and I have

825
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,500
counseled some in that category as well

826
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:55,089
some have gone on to successful industry

827
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,300
positions they realized they didn't need

828
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,650
a PhD for where they wanted to end up

829
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,630
some of them end up coming back for a

830
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,608
PhD after working for a while because

831
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:07,750
they realize there's a ceiling for

832
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:09,400
masters students or master's degree

833
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,349
recipients in the field that they want

834
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,108
to go into some have ended up in public

835
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:19,050
policy and are working on maternal-fetal

836
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:21,549
nutritional health and and and so on so

837
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:42,190
but I don't have the statistics here I

838
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:44,260
could look into those well if you so

839
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,849
that's an individual decision we can't

840
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,380
make a blanket statement it obviously

841
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:52,359
depends on your field and where you want

842
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:55,630
to end up but as many people see you

843
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:57,608
will get paid much more and you you

844
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,760
might just as a question about having a

845
00:38:57,608 --> 00:39:03,159
postdoc is necessary is a PhD necessary

846
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,320
is also a question you should have and

847
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,618
we encourage people to make that thought

848
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,180
before they enroll into the ph.d program

849
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:13,329
but if you haven't given thought to that

850
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:15,219
it's an important question and that's

851
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,539
why it's important to talk to people who

852
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,969
are in the field that you want to go

853
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:20,920
into and that's one thing I did I

854
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:23,108
counseled the person who was leaving

855
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,599
with their masters she's very happily as

856
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:27,880
a process engineer at Pfizer right now

857
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,160
and she she chose to leave with her

858
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,950
master's degree but I connected her with

859
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,079
people who either did have their PhD or

860
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:38,439
did not have their PhD so she could have

861
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,838
a comparison of what the both the salary

862
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,220
level and the advancement levels are for

863
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,219
that degree outcome

864
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:59,029
teaching either four-year liberal arts

865
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,579
college research focused also on a

866
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,670
community college is there an area for

867
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:06,260
students that decide they want to go

868
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,608
even though we are in academia it's a

869
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,020
very different thing during the research

870
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:11,019
versus having a really strong

871
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:15,199
absolutely so the question is on how

872
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,880
about teaching focused careers either if

873
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,279
you want to go to a community college or

874
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,710
K through 12 environment or at a

875
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,019
four-year liberal arts college so

876
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,298
actually our program doesn't cover

877
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:28,068
teaching at all because we have an

878
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:31,159
excellent center for teaching excellence

879
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:33,139
and we have CU circle which is part of a

880
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,629
like a forty eight institution

881
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:39,078
consortium that provides information

882
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,579
about teaching and academic careers in

883
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,700
fact I brought their brochures today

884
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:45,710
because I think it's very important

885
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,779
career outcome to support and so we work

886
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:51,019
very closely with them they have a great

887
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:55,670
academic job search series and mentoring

888
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:58,929
series and how to flip the classroom and

889
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,930
use other teaching techniques

890
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,700
okay so the other question is funding

891
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:09,969
for best friendships so that's an

892
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,960
ongoing discussion for all our

893
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:15,558
consortium because there are different

894
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,679
models so for large companies usually

895
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,780
they will pay for the person to do an

896
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,969
internship it's a no brainer however

897
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,609
there are certain international students

898
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:28,068
due to visa restrictions that can't get

899
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:29,900
paid in which case that was actually one

900
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,639
of the on campus best friendships that

901
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,380
we arranged so they worked in the

902
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:37,750
licensing office but actually weren't

903
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,750
paid but they got that experience anyway

904
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:50,500
so there's almost every possible

905
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:53,629
combination you can think of to address

906
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,838
how they address the tuition payments

907
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,660
and enrollment situation so it's done on

908
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:59,960
an individual

909
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,190
and it's really hard to make a blanket

910
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,079
statement about that there have been

911
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,329
departments on campus that created a

912
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,869
course called internships and

913
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:12,180
experiential opportunities and as long

914
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:14,338
as it's offered to all students not just

915
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,889
international students it's not seen as

916
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,929
a way to get around federal rules that's

917
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:23,759
been an option that some universities

918
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:25,529
have used we'd like to adhere to the

919
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,819
Fair Labor Standards Act which means if

920
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,180
you are adding value

921
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:34,558
you must get paid and we want to address

922
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:36,838
the perception that grad students and

923
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,609
postdocs should not shortchange

924
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,828
themselves they shouldn't undersell

925
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:43,348
themselves they a lot of skills they

926
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:46,230
probably shouldn't volunteer for an

927
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:47,880
unpaid internship unless it's really for

928
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,548
their training and the only way they can

929
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,838
get their experience under their belt I

930
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:56,460
think there are ways of showing the

931
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:00,269
value that you're going to add to a

932
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,579
company even or even a small institution

933
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:05,278
now there are nonprofits which have zero

934
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:09,269
money to be able to pay you in which

935
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:11,219
case sometimes there are creative ways I

936
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:16,159
don't want to say to launder money but

937
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:18,838
to circulate the funds such that we can

938
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:23,690
reimburse the company let's say for

939
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:26,880
their training time or for the

940
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,700
consulting that the student does we can

941
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,740
pay for travel and accommodations if

942
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:35,399
they go to a place so maybe they don't

943
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:38,368
get paid per se while there but there's

944
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,730
some mitigation that we can make so that

945
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:43,858
it's more accessible some people have

946
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,869
taken leaves of absence and others just

947
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:48,500
do it on the side so it's really a

948
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:48,500
smorgasbord

949
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:10,578
yeah we're we're not so the question was

950
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:13,129
about whether the best friendships are

951
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:18,059
pre-arranged or whether it's up to the

952
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,750
trainee to to find that we have done it

953
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:22,200
both ways

954
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:24,358
so sometimes a faculty member has one of

955
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:26,038
their students who went off and started

956
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:28,230
a consulting company and they just got

957
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,720
an SBIR grant and they're looking for a

958
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:34,619
trainee that's how that student got that

959
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,778
policymaking job they sent it to me and

960
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,180
I send it out say hey who's interested

961
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:42,960
they apply and then they were accepted

962
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:46,078
for that other times it's the trainee

963
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,699
and you know the best that the best fit

964
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,619
is gonna be one you create yourself

965
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:51,750
right because I don't know what you want

966
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,559
I don't know your career fields

967
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:58,079
necessarily and so the most meaningful

968
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,769
interactions will be those that you've

969
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,839
found yourself or created yourself

970
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:05,429
however to make that easier we do have a

971
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,219
list of all the biopharmaceutical

972
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:10,528
companies that have formal internship

973
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,209
sites so you can click once and get

974
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:14,579
right to their internships and jobs page

975
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,798
so we try and save you some time in

976
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:19,920
doing that so you don't have as big a

977
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:22,380
search we have a list of all the major

978
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,420
think tanks for instance or we have a

979
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,250
list of all the professional societies

980
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,690
that you know maybe you want to become

981
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,778
more involved in the fight of

982
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,490
pathological Society to arrange student

983
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:34,858
symposium on career development or

984
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:36,899
communication or something so we try and

985
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:38,250
create those links to make it a little

986
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,400
bit easier for you to do your own

987
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,400
homework

988
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:55,558
if Geneva has any questions like the

989
00:45:48,599 --> 00:46:06,079
thing is I can't hear them so we don't

990
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:10,920
thank you so much we can all hear you

991
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:13,940
cool if we wanted to just we best come

992
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,700
up to Geneva to do like presentations or

993
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,450
we have students to participate up here

994
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,980
or

995
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:22,139
on the other end is their way through

996
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,179
when you bring in speakers that are

997
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:25,828
presenting down on main campus like are

998
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:29,578
they in rooms that are compatible with

999
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:33,990
this system so that we can conference

1000
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:37,530
them in toss up here okay to answer your

1001
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:42,808
first question just invite me and to

1002
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:45,990
answer your second question we would

1003
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:49,920
need a student who's enterprising to set

1004
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:52,679
up that connection and so we we could if

1005
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,559
you have the rooms then we could create

1006
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,659
that opportunity so let's say if we want

1007
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,910
to have a speaker in here we could do

1008
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:02,489
that if somebody's willing to provide

1009
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:33,328
the technology to connect you so yeah we

1010
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:36,509
want to include you so the question as I

1011
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:38,490
understand is on how the word gets

1012
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,829
around about the best programs do we

1013
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:43,979
have allies in different units or how

1014
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:46,170
does the word get around so to be honest

1015
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,940
when I took this position we had a

1016
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,000
cohort model where I said I could handle

1017
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,190
about 50 or 60 students and now their

1018
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,900
first executive board meeting we changed

1019
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,809
our vision and said we need to be open

1020
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:02,519
to everybody so now we have about 350 60

1021
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:06,359
but we touch over 1100 so the bandwidth

1022
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:08,159
is low for doing active marketing but

1023
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:12,150
that's why I have an advisory board so

1024
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,199
our advisory board has members from 10

1025
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,568
different fields

1026
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,848
hopefully the word of mouth gets around

1027
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:21,199
to those fields I also have a listserv

1028
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:24,859
where anybody could join I also often

1029
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:28,048
email the Graduate field assistants and

1030
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:30,210
DG s's for each of the fields our

1031
00:48:28,048 --> 00:48:32,039
program started focused in the

1032
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:35,159
biomedical fields how

1033
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:37,409
it's stem wide and so we've done some

1034
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:41,759
outreach to faculty department meetings

1035
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:44,519
which is this kind of setup we've done

1036
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,570
road shows to to those existing faculty

1037
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:50,480
meetings and we have a website that we

1038
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:52,620
hope people will go to our target

1039
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,110
predominantly has been grad students and

1040
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:56,699
postdocs so we advertising that post

1041
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,039
doctoral newsletter in my graduate

1042
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:01,169
school announcements and other things

1043
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,550
where I grad students and postdocs hang

1044
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,230
out but there's still people who never

1045
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:06,539
hear about it and I think that's a

1046
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,550
challenge at Cornell in general about

1047
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,110
how to communicate all the fabulous

1048
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:34,730
resources that are at everyone's

1049
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:36,480
disposal so the question is about

1050
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,190
institutionalization how the program

1051
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,579
will continue beyond the life of our

1052
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,900
grants and so I'm working on that end

1053
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,590
because I'll also be looking at the next

1054
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,980
opportunity

1055
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:49,590
right because that's what I do hundred

1056
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,960
percent of my time so we write support

1057
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,420
letters for grants where perhaps a

1058
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,920
portion of the training would be done

1059
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,980
through the best program and then

1060
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,380
supported on the ground we have a

1061
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:05,070
proposal into the graduate school who's

1062
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,860
working with the provost and chief

1063
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:09,170
financial officer to see what can be

1064
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,780
done there but those are ongoing

1065
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:14,220
discussions now other consortium members

1066
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,710
have different models for that as well

1067
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,569
many of them have like a give button

1068
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,849
right on their best site where alumni

1069
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,950
can donate to their program or they work

1070
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:26,159
with an industry organization to

1071
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:29,460
hopefully have you know New Jersey bio

1072
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,440
Fund internships for graduate students

1073
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,409
and postdocs so everybody has it kind of

1074
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,240
a different model Wayne State the P I

1075
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:38,399
happens to be the Dean so she just takes

1076
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:40,019
it out of her Dean pocket and gives it

1077
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,180
to the best program so you know they're

1078
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:43,980
different models that are that are

1079
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,239
working and I think it might be a

1080
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,199
combination of all those

1081
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:51,389
and it might be that we concentrate our

1082
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:52,679
efforts and reduce our offerings to the

1083
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:54,420
areas where we're making the most

1084
00:50:52,679 --> 00:51:09,690
difference which is why our evaluations

1085
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:12,720
are so important this has been a

1086
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:16,940
production of Cornell University on the

1087
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,939
web at cornell edu
