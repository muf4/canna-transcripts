1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,359
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,599
University. Okay, thank you so much for

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,279
such a nice introduction. Um, I'm really

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
happy to give a talk and talk a little

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,839
bit more about both my research and the

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,240
phenocite. Uh, and hopefully I get to

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,118
convince you all to come and use our

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,198
fantastic phenotyping facility more. Uh,

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,198
because we do have space and we do have,

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
you know, availability for for for

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,559
phenotyping all of your plants.

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,519
So as you probably are aware the world

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:38,640
is experiencing crisises of all kinds

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
and uh agriculture in in particular

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
let's focus on the crisis that we can

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
actually know something about and do

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
something about. So uh you can see all

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,399
kinds of crisis including pollution,

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,398
deforestation, erosion, things like

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
that. I don't really know too much about

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,280
soil which is weird for a root biologist

22
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,599
but um yeah uh but what I do know quite

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,439
a lot about is water stress. So you've

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,280
got and the blue dots are representing

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,119
regions that are affected by water

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
stress. So you've got either too much

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,798
water, too little water or the wrong

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,118
kind of water. And that's the case in

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
salt stress. So what we can do about it

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,000
as plant biologists with our talents,

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,920
our skills, our knowledge, we can

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,319
diversify the agriculture. So don't be

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,719
fooled by my Photoshop skills. Here is a

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,519
desert rose that is native to an island

35
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,319
off the coast of Yemen in Satra, which

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,879
is here. Very desert-like environment.

37
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,279
And we can learn about from those

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,039
extreme extreme plants, how are they

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,400
dealing with those extreme environments

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,799
and maybe include that in our species

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
that we like to eat like tomatoes. Or we

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
can look at the species that are very

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,479
closely related to the species that we

44
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,719
already like to eat uh and look at the

45
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,239
intrapecific variation. So within the

46
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,798
species and that's that's really the

47
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,078
approach that my lab has been taking to

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,079
really look at the wild relatives to uh

49
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,919
to common to to crops that we like to

50
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,438
eat um and uh and learn from them

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
because those species haven't been

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,519
pampered in the greenhouse, haven't been

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,759
pampered by the breeders. Uh so they

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,359
really had to fend for themselves. So

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,039
let's learn from that. And so as as Jan

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440
already mentioned, so we're we're

57
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,598
working on a quite a variety of species.

58
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,680
Arabidopsis is still a workhorse in the

59
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,439
lab because it's just an easy plant to

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
work with and and validate some of our

61
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,878
things. Uh we're also working on the

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,800
wild tomato which is a very close

63
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,439
relative to cultivated tomatoes, salan

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
pimpleium. So that's this guy over here.

65
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,039
We also have been working on peppery

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,280
beans. Uh temporary bean is a close

67
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,519
relative to uh common beans. It's a

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,598
fasciola species. It's native to

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
southwest of the US and northern Mexico.

70
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,119
So another very dry environment and it

71
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,919
has been used by native communities uh

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
for for for centuries right now. Uh

73
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,359
we've got natural diversity panel

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
established for that that we have we

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
have sequenced. I'm not really going to

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
talk too much about that. The other

77
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,679
species um that we're also investigating

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,479
is cowpie. So cowpi is native to

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
subsaharan Africa where it has been you

80
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,238
know a great resource for many

81
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,000
subsistence farmers that don't have

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
access to irrigation don't have access

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
to a lot of fertilization and it's

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,239
really thriving there and the really

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
cool thing about comparing those two

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
species together temporary bean it's

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,920
fasiolus aquitifolius if you know any

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,158
Latin like not me um you can you can say

89
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,318
like okay so actifolius is really

90
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:30,479
because the leaf the the the needle like

91
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,639
leaf right Um, so temporary bean, it has

92
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,719
those very, very narrow leaves. Like, no

93
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,039
wonder you're drought tolerant because

94
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,479
you have hardly any leaves. Cowpie, on

95
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:43,120
the other hand, has leaves as big as my

96
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,878
head. So, it's really interesting that

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
both of those species have drought

98
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,439
tolerance, but probably the mechanism or

99
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,318
their strategy of dealing with drought

100
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,840
stress is very, very different. And at

101
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,280
the beginning when I was starting a lab,

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,959
I'm like, okay, I'm going to screen all

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
of those species for drought tolerance

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
and see which genes are common between

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
them. And now I'm like, I cannot do that

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
because it's a stupid idea because all

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,599
of those different populations are very

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,360
different. So cowpi, we're really

109
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,679
screening a population of domesticated

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,560
species. Pepper bean, we've got a mix of

111
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
domesticated and wild accessions. salon

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,439
pimpleum as far as I'm aware except

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,559
maybe for joy for an egg nobody has

114
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,719
domesticated pimpinelogum yet uh so

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,879
we're really dealing with a variety of

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
different populations and their nature

117
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,719
so of course we're not going to find the

118
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,918
same genetic signals it's already hard

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,160
to find to reproduce giwas between two

120
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,279
different greenh houses so let alone

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,199
between the species but in the end I'm

122
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,119
like well it's might be not the best

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
idea to look for commonalities of

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,600
drought stress resistance but diversity

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,319
and that's a that's a hot work hot word

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,840
in the in the recent recent climate but

127
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:56,319
diversity of mechanisms and strategies

128
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,959
uh of of dealing with drought stress

129
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,279
might be actually even better because if

130
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,918
I I have my own ways of dealing with

131
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,839
stress before the presentation and maybe

132
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,839
Jim will have a different strategy of

133
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,839
dealing with stress and if we're kind of

134
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
exchanging those strategies between each

135
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,679
other maybe we can get even more relaxed

136
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,839
and even more chill because I know that

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,038
Jim is a great presenter. Um so um so

138
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,599
similarly with drought stress maybe by

139
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,360
combining different strategies exhibited

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
by different plants we can actually get

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
like super drought tolerant plants or

142
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,560
breed plants for different drought

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
scenarios because droughts in in Ithaca

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,519
is very different compared to drought in

145
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,639
Arizona or drought in Australia. Right?

146
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,159
So before I go into more detail, I'm

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,400
really going to focus a little bit on

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,280
the discovery pipeline that we're using.

149
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,519
So we're really looking at the starting

150
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,679
with the trait identification. So you

151
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,599
have a whole phenotype of a plant and

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
you can study all kinds of things. The

153
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
longer you look at the plant, the more

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,960
things that you can measure, you can

155
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:03,279
think of. The trick is for us is that

156
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,959
that specific trait need to have some

157
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,559
kind of heritability because we are

158
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,439
using forward genetics. If there's no

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,360
heritability to it, maybe genetics is

160
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,879
not the best way of studying it. Maybe

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,038
metab biochemistry or transcrytoics is

162
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,279
is the best way to do that. But for us,

163
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,120
we're really relying on genetic. Uh so

164
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,599
we're looking at heritability. The other

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,079
thing that a lot of geneticists are not

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,560
a big fan of is we're looking at how

167
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,680
that trait is how how that trait is

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,600
plastic in response to stress. So a lot

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
of the research that has been done on

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
that has been already done on genetics

171
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,080
of stress resilience has been done on

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
you know genes that are like traits that

173
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,519
are not necessarily changing throughout

174
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,279
the environment and there was a very

175
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,159
good reason for that because you want

176
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,159
your corn to be growing very well in the

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,560
field in Ithaca as well as it's growing

178
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
in the field in Geneva as well as in

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
Pennsylvania and everywhere else in the

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,319
world. So you want something that has

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
really really high heritability. But

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,319
we're missing on the things that the

183
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,120
plants are incredibly plastic. We know

184
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,720
that if you grow plants in different day

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,959
length, they start to develop different

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
number of leaves. The leaf size might

187
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,799
change a little bit. The number of

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
flatter roots is changing constantly

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
depending on the water availability. So

190
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,159
we're really interested in like okay

191
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,439
what are the traits that are showing

192
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
some plasticity and and that's a part of

193
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,879
like an experience of working with GW

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,720
was we really want to have as atomic

195
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,959
value of a trait as possible and that's

196
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,039
why we're working with the fiends. So

197
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:37,079
fiend to phenotype is the same as gene

198
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:40,240
to genotype, right? So fi is like a

199
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,159
dissected component of of your

200
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,199
phenotype. And if you think about like

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,000
okay well if I study drought stress

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,919
tolerance and I just study survival

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,478
survival is extremely complex trait

204
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,680
because it depends on how deep are your

205
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,360
root grows how what is your water use

206
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,918
efficiency how big is your shoot toroot

207
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
ratio uh what is your growth rate

208
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,758
maintenance all this stuff are you

209
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,439
slowing down as soon as you're like

210
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
thinking like okay I've got I'm

211
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,519
experiencing drought I need to stop for

212
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,000
a second and think and adjust and then

213
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,758
keep on growing or am I just like

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,959
insensitive to drought and keep on

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,280
growing and then I grow myself to death

216
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:22,560
really. Um so we're trying to dissect

217
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,918
the phenotype into as many molecular

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,918
like as many components that are as as

219
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,799
easy as possible to describe with a

220
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:33,199
number and hopefully by doing that we're

221
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,719
increasing the heritability. So if you

222
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,879
think about like the survival, the

223
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,399
heritability of survival, it's hard to

224
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:43,120
measure. Um but heritability of growth

225
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,720
in one week after germination, well

226
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,000
that's that's already increasing, right?

227
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,680
And the growth rate is already a

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,399
complicated trait and you can divide it

229
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,799
even further, right? So then okay, I

230
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,399
spend a lot of time on that. Now now

231
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,479
that we've got a lot the trait

232
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
identified of interest, we're going to

233
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,320
do a population screening. We're doing

234
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
phenotyping and forward genetics. And

235
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
then only once we are at the level of

236
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,920
gene of interest, we're we're doing a

237
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,278
study. We're validating it using reverse

238
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,958
genetics, we're identifying what is the

239
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,720
molecular context because some of the

240
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,199
genes might not be conserved in all of

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,440
the species, but the molecular context

242
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,920
in which they are as they are acting

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,760
might be easily translatable across

244
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,240
across different varieties of species

245
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,439
that we like to eat. And also at this

246
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
level, we're really going to look at

247
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,680
like what is the relationship between my

248
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,759
trait of interest caused by one by by

249
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,599
that one gene and the overall plant

250
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,360
performance. We're not looking at the

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
correlations or relationship at the

252
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,680
level of natural diversity panel because

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,360
those plants that are different in

254
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,199
number of lateral roots, number of

255
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,959
branches, they are also very different

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,959
in their root physiology and morphology

257
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,359
and pollen development and stuff like

258
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,199
that. So if I'm harvesting all of the

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
diversity that is really related to the

260
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
root system architecture, why should I

261
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,199
be ignoring all of the diversity that is

262
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,719
happening in the in the reproductive

263
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
development, right? So I should be

264
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,639
cognizant about that and looking at the

265
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,639
relationship between that at the natural

266
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,879
diversity panel might not be the best

267
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,399
idea. If you've got maybe a biparental

268
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,320
population, that's a very different

269
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,839
conversation. All right. So as Jan told

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,160
you, I I already started my kind of

271
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,640
research in in stress induced changes in

272
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,000
plant architecture really looking at

273
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,799
arabidopsis because that's a well-

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,120
domesticated species in the lab. Um and

275
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,879
really we we're asking like okay so when

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
I grow my plants in the increasing

277
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,200
concentration of salt stress my plants

278
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,399
are getting smaller but are they growing

279
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,560
different is just smaller like and how

280
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,039
how are we going to tell if it's just

281
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,639
slower and smaller or is it a

282
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,159
difference? So what we have done is we

283
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,078
really dissected the root system

284
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,838
architecture in three components. So

285
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,919
you've got a speed at which your main

286
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
route is growing, a speed at which the

287
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,958
lateral roots are popping up, and the

288
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,200
speed at which the lateral roots are

289
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,958
growing. So now we're using the same

290
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
functions for all of the three

291
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,599
components. If all of my functions are

292
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,160
decreasing by

293
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,839
50% under stress, it means root system

294
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,240
architecture is not changed. It's just

295
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,600
really slower. But if one of my

296
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,919
functions is decreased by 20% and the

297
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
other one is decreased by 80%, it's like

298
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,719
ah okay the stress is really actively

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,959
reprogramming my my plant architecture

300
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,160
my root system architecture because the

301
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,159
plant is actively choosing to put more

302
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,240
biomass in their lateral roots compared

303
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,159
to the main root.

304
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,680
So those models were the basis of um the

305
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,199
whole screen of the natural diversity

306
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,159
panel back then that we had in uh in

307
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,959
Arabidopsis. Right now the natural

308
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,439
diversity pan of arabidopsis is extended

309
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,039
uh beyond very eurosentric population.

310
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,880
So we have collected some accessions

311
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:56,559
from Africa, Saudi Arabia as well and um

312
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:59,360
and and and uh greater Asia. Uh we have

313
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,119
also developed this uh screen to look

314
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,720
because root system architecture we're

315
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,799
very proud bunch of people because we're

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,399
working on the hidden half but it's

317
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:11,120
still a half of the plant. So um when I

318
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,278
was doing my postoc in in cow mark was

319
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,919
Mark asked me like well what happens to

320
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,600
the roottoshoot ratio under salt stress

321
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,000
and so we developed this little tool

322
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
that you can quantify the shoot size and

323
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,559
the root size from your augur plate

324
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,799
images and we realized that okay that

325
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,958
the the rootsto ratio unlike under

326
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,439
drought stress under salt it just gets

327
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,919
disregulated we identify a gene that is

328
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,560
causal for that and that paper just got

329
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,039
published so yay and Mariam a posuck in

330
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,759
my lab really made the the final strides

331
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,559
in that in that work. But today I really

332
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,958
want to focus on uh pimpleium. So

333
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,000
pimpleium is a wild tomato. Here you can

334
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,679
see a plant of pimpleium growing in the

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
uh high throughput phenotyping facility

336
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:57,439
in Australia. So we are working with

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,600
approximately 220 accession of pimpinary

338
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,320
volume that were that were collected

339
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,639
around the west coast of South America

340
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,839
and some of the Galapagos Islands. Um

341
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,200
they're important source of genetic

342
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,279
variation. Their native range is really

343
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,440
varying because you've got regions that

344
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,838
are called the llamas uh which are those

345
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,839
fog deserts. So there's hardly any rain

346
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,600
and really the only only the fog is

347
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
coming in there but then some of those

348
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,000
excessions were collected around the

349
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,959
river beds where you know it's not

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,879
exactly like limited in water. Uh so we

351
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,119
thought okay there is a really great

352
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,519
great variety of environments that those

353
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,360
excessions were collected with. uh so we

354
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,480
have already screened them back in cow

355
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,959
in the field uh in for for control and

356
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,600
salt stress and in the plant accelerator

357
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,719
in Australia and that work has also been

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,159
published last year. So me being me I'm

359
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,000
like let's have a look at the root

360
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,559
system architecture. How are we doing

361
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,519
that? I just did that before I left

362
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,439
Saudi Arabia. So we're germinating the

363
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,039
plants under control conditions. We

364
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,440
transfer them for until for control and

365
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,919
sold plates and then we scan the plates

366
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,399
every single day. And then what we're

367
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,399
doing is not necessarily high throughput

368
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,958
phenotyping. I like to call it high

369
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,919
dedication phenotyping because there is

370
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:19,198
until now there was not really a way of

371
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,838
automating it fully. And every single

372
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,399
person that has been working with half

373
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,480
half automated pipelines also can

374
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,799
appreciate how much work half manual

375
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,600
work is because you can still you have

376
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,039
to still like draw all of those roots uh

377
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
and make sure that every single time

378
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,679
that they are crossing to manually

379
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,439
correct like which which route is what.

380
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,519
So we have done that together with Haley

381
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
Susman who was a technician in my lab we

382
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,639
have screened the entire diversity

383
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,679
panel.

384
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,278
All good. But with Mariam, we really

385
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,198
looked at the diversity panel in

386
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,278
slightly different way and we're like,

387
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,679
okay, are there any plants that are

388
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,759
showing exactly the opposite response to

389
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,759
stress? And we have identified two

390
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,879
lines. So we've got M248 which is uh

391
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,639
pimpleium and we thought well how about

392
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,000
we also look at some of the cultivated

393
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,639
lines. So we looked at the LA511 and as

394
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,879
you can see in here they're showing both

395
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,720
of them are grown on salt stress and

396
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,439
they're showing exactly the opposite

397
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,720
response. So one of

398
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,560
them is really investing in um producing

399
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,560
new lateral roots but those lateral

400
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,559
roots they are not really like very good

401
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,879
at growing. The other one on the other

402
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,638
hand is really very good in investing in

403
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,480
elongating the existing lateral roots

404
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,639
but there are not many new lateral roots

405
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,079
showing up. So we thought okay this is

406
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,720
really cool maybe we can do some

407
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,159
transcrytoics but which time points. So

408
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,399
for that purpose we grew our plants on

409
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,120
this device that is called spyro. It's

410
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,159
entirely well it's 3D printed and it

411
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,320
also has some aluminium profiles. Uh so

412
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,078
we can image we can we can take the

413
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,519
pictures of the plants growing on the

414
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,838
augur plates every hour.

415
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,919
So Mariam or me don't have to sit in the

416
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,759
lab and scan those plates every hour

417
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,639
which is as you can imagine quite

418
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,320
laborious and boring. Anyway, so we

419
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,519
collected all of those images. So now

420
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,800
we've got a time series that is

421
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,879
incredibly dense for both of our lines

422
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,879
under control conditions and salt

423
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,519
stress. So salt stress is red and you

424
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,198
can see that one of our lines is indeed

425
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
so in here we're looking at the lateral

426
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,039
root length individual length of latch

427
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
roots and you can see that one of them

428
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,480
is really suffering in their lateral

429
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,759
root elongation and the other one is

430
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,440
like salt what salt what's happening the

431
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,278
same happens if you calculate the root

432
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,279
growth rate so it's basically derived

433
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,120
from here and you can see that the root

434
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,439
growth rate again for one of them is

435
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
really suffering and for the other one

436
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
it's like well no I don't really see

437
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,198
much of a difference only at the later

438
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,679
stage we're starting to see difference.

439
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,919
Then we looked at the popping up of new

440
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,519
lateral roots and you have in the in in

441
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,838
here you also have the time after

442
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,480
transfer to different lines and you can

443
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,680
see in this line that all of the lateral

444
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,879
roots so the line that was really

445
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,879
struggling with the lateral root

446
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,119
elongation you can see that the lateral

447
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,799
roots are popping out throughout. If you

448
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,119
look at the average yeah it is a little

449
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,918
bit delayed but average in that specific

450
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,438
scenario is not super

451
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,038
informative. But if we look at the other

452
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,798
line, you can see that all of the

453
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,240
lateral roots that are indicated by the

454
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,879
red bars are clearly delayed in here. So

455
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,400
this superdetailed time point allowed us

456
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,559
to select time points before before we

457
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,640
we start see visual differences that we

458
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,839
then harvested for the for the RNA sec

459
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,679
experiments. What Mariam also did

460
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,359
because she has a training as a

461
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,360
reproductive biologist, so she's not

462
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,759
afraid of crossing plants. So she

463
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,279
crossed those two

464
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:47,599
lines and we looked at the root system

465
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,200
architecture of the F1 hybrid and I was

466
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,319
like well you know combining those two

467
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,880
traits it's just too good to be true and

468
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,599
yet those two strategies seem to be

469
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,480
complimentary because we don't see plant

470
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,599
with either more lateral roots or longer

471
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,360
lateral roots we see both of them. So

472
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,199
yes we can significantly improve

473
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,678
although both of those two lines

474
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,160
whenever we look at them in the field on

475
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
in the plant accelerator both of them

476
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,400
are growing pretty well we can still

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,798
improve on the pretty salt tolerant

478
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,038
accessions by combining their their

479
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,918
their uh their complimentary strategies

480
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,000
which I think it's really really cool so

481
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,640
what we did of course we did all of the

482
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,720
genomide association after um uh after

483
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,280
Mariam crossed the F1 we also grew them

484
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,079
out for F2 and Zangjin Feay helped us

485
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:41,599
with the B segregant analysis for all of

486
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,599
those BS and Leangu from Andrew's lab

487
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,678
helped us with the RNA sec experiment

488
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,038
and analyzing all of this data. So we

489
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,280
have the genes that are associated

490
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,960
through GWAS we've got the regions of

491
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,879
the chromosomes that are associated with

492
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
the book segregant and then we've got

493
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,799
individual gene expressions that are

494
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,919
differing between our lines. So what is

495
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:06,879
the overlap? So we found couple there

496
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,759
are some of the lines that or some of

497
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,880
the genes that are the

498
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,440
duf677 it's one of the strongest

499
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,600
candidates but the do the duf stands for

500
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,480
basically domain of unknown function so

501
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,319
thank you for calling it anything but we

502
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,319
cannot really like make too much sense

503
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,720
out of that. Two other things that we

504
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,639
found that are described as something is

505
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,279
this uh ethylene responsive

506
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,240
transcription factor to3 and ascorbate

507
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,399
peroxide. So basically vitamin C

508
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,798
peroxidase having something to do with u

509
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,320
reactive oxygen species. Couple of

510
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:46,160
months ago, uh Ron Mitler was visiting

511
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:48,399
um Cornell and Mariam went to his talk

512
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
and then she started, you know, sending

513
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,038
him messages like, "Hey, Ron, can you

514
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,038
image the roots of our tomatoes because

515
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,119
we think there is something going on

516
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,519
with reactive different reactive oxygen

517
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,519
species reaction." So Ron was like,

518
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,119
"Okay, cool. Send me the seeds." So we

519
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,359
sent him the seeds and um Santos did did

520
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,439
most of the experiments for growing the

521
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,199
seeds and basically here's an example of

522
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,600
how so they are really using a

523
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,000
visualization for the react for the

524
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:20,359
hydrogen peroxide um in live images. So

525
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,880
what we have seen and in here we've

526
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:27,959
got accession number one accession

527
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,960
number two in root and in shoot

528
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,079
wait yes okay this is complicated

529
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,079
figures so we've got accession number

530
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,319
one is having much more reactive oxygen

531
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,599
species accumulation quite early on in

532
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,918
the root while the accession number two

533
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,279
doesn't like nothing is happening in the

534
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,799
in the root whatsoever

535
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,720
But this one is having much more

536
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,639
reactions in the chute compared to the

537
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,960
root compared to the sorry other

538
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,880
accession. Right? So we have the ones

539
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,480
that that are if you don't have a

540
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,240
reaction in the root you will have a

541
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
reaction in the chute and it's not

542
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,359
necessarily sequential because in the

543
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
chute we see the signal building up much

544
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,959
quicker than we see in the root. So

545
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,879
there are the absolutely differences in

546
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
the reactive oxygen species accumulation

547
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,480
between those two lines. We're still

548
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
cloning the genes and we're hoping to

549
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,200
knock them out in both of the lives to

550
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,558
see what is the effect. Um, but this is

551
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,720
an intermediate result. Um, and then

552
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,119
what we also did is this is another

553
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,558
complicated graph. Uh, we also grew the

554
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:35,439
plants with ascorbate with and with

555
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,519
H2O2. So what we're seeing in here, so

556
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,798
let's have a look at the sold stress the

557
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,759
red dots and we've got the main root

558
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:47,679
growth r growth rate average lateral

559
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:49,440
root growth rate. So how how fast is the

560
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,519
main root growing? How fast are the

561
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,600
lateral roots growing? How f how how

562
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,839
quickly are new lateral roots popping

563
00:21:53,599 --> 00:22:00,079
up? Right? So our c this cultivated one

564
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:03,199
is we've got okay lateral roots

565
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,439
elongation is suffering more than number

566
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,919
of lateral roots and in here we've got

567
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,320
an opposite pattern right so we've got

568
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
lateral roots keep on elongating but the

569
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:16,720
lateral root number is suffering right

570
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,519
cool so then when we add in here the

571
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,558
green one is we add asbate as soon as we

572
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,960
add ascbate this pattern is not really

573
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,599
changing much because the lateral roots

574
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,000
are still growing great. We get a little

575
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,399
bit more lateral roots popping up, but

576
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,279
in here, haha, we are reversing the

577
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,000
pattern. So, we are rescuing the lateral

578
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,720
roots and still grow faster. And then

579
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,880
whenever we add hydrogen peroxide into

580
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,919
the plates, we're kind of making

581
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,280
everything even worse. And this line,

582
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,200
for whatever reason, it's like, well,

583
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,440
I'm still fine because it's not probably

584
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,440
not related to ascorbate ascorbate

585
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:59,159
metabolism at all. And we also looked uh

586
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,320
on ion accumulation and we have noticed

587
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,200
that ascorbate addition of the ascorbate

588
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,279
is lowering the potassium to sodium

589
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
ratio. So potassium to sodium ratio is

590
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,200
important because typically under salt

591
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,080
stress potassium is out competing the

592
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,120
sodium. No other way around sodium is

593
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,599
out competing potassium. So the higher

594
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,678
that number is the worse the plant is

595
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,319
getting. So getting it lowered by

596
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,840
ascorbate is a great result and is

597
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,319
reflecting kind of the changes what's

598
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,279
what are happening in the root system

599
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,119
architecture. All right. So that's

600
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,279
that's where we at with our like

601
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,199
molecular biology following up finding

602
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:39,240
the genes. We also started to uh explore

603
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,319
how we can describe the root system

604
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,359
architectures using different metrics.

605
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:48,240
So when we were spending entire pandemic

606
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,240
looking at the roots and tracing them,

607
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,759
we started to observe like a very

608
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
distinct pattern. So you've got roots

609
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,200
that are really growing like a Christmas

610
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,158
tree or roots that are growing like a

611
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,558
telephone pole, a little bit droopier

612
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,400
telephone pole and a broomstick. So all

613
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,798
of the later roots are coming from from

614
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,880
the base. And in here you've got it's

615
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,200
really like a maze root. Like all of the

616
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,840
roots, they are very nicely spaced but

617
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,679
very definite length. we don't have that

618
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,599
diversity of the of the lateral root

619
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,679
length as we see in the in the Christmas

620
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,079
tree, right? So, we're like, well, this

621
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,798
is cool and I see it and I know when I

622
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:25,119
see it, but when I'm using my metrics of

623
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,278
lateral root number per plant, average

624
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,678
lateral root size, even the branch zone

625
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:33,200
size, I always have this one comparison

626
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,600
that is not significant. And I I know

627
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,080
that I should have like a number. How do

628
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,278
I describe that? And that's a never-

629
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:44,000
ending conundrum of anyone that is doing

630
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:46,319
phenotyping. I see it with my brain. How

631
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
do I translate it into a number? So I

632
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,639
was like, "Oh, maybe I can combine all

633
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,559
of those three numbers." Mathematical

634
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,000
modeling. And then Arjent Chandra Seca,

635
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,839
who is a good friend and a

636
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,599
mathematician, he's like, "Well, no, how

637
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,038
about we just calculate the Pareto front

638
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,319
optimality for those root system

639
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:03,558
architectures and then you've got all

640
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,399
nicely

641
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:09,480
separated things." Mac, great. Can you

642
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,080
explain what this PTO front optimality

643
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,960
is? I've got a number, but how does the

644
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:18,319
number work? So, Paretofront optimality

645
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,120
is really designed for um like

646
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,399
evaluating efficiency of infrastructures

647
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,399
in the cities. So, in here we've got a

648
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,720
subway network of my favorite city in

649
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,640
the world, Amsterdam. And you can see

650
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,319
that everyone you've got all of those

651
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,080
neighborhoods that are semi-affordable

652
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,798
to work with. everyone needs to go to

653
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,558
the central station and you've got all

654
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:42,480
of those hubs. Sometimes they're

655
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,798
crossing over. Okay, we can also think

656
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,720
about like that in a root system

657
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,480
architecture. So you've got the roots,

658
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,319
you've got all of the absorption

659
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,000
happening of nutrients and water.

660
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,558
Although if you talk to people that are

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,519
working on modeling of water and

662
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:57,200
nutrients, we still don't really know

663
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,839
how the root is absorbing water, which

664
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,919
is mind mindboggling for me. Anyways,

665
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,759
but let's assume that we are absorbing

666
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,799
majority of water nutrients in the with

667
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,119
the tips and here we've got big pipes

668
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,240
that are doing majority of the

669
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,399
transport. Okay, so we can think about

670
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,720
it as neighborhoods that need to get to

671
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,519
central

672
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,200
station. So we need to abstract it. So

673
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,519
abstracting the root, we've got a root

674
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,759
system architecture, but we can connect

675
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,200
all of our lateral roots in a very fast

676
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,839
way, in a very cheap way, and in some

677
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,400
intermediate solution. So basically what

678
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,720
partotront optimality is saying you

679
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,200
don't have one optimal solution for your

680
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,319
problem. You've got a front of optimal

681
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,038
solutions and you can see how far from

682
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,879
those optimal solutions you are right

683
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:49,599
and that gives you a

684
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:52,120
number. So um however there are couple

685
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,359
of couple of issues with the parto front

686
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,839
optimality. So right now we are assuming

687
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,479
that

688
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,240
conductivity and the cost of a lateral

689
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
root is exactly the same as for the main

690
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,720
route. So in here this is a very quick

691
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,278
experiment that I did for for for this

692
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,079
grand that we got is looking at the

693
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,000
number of vessels in the main route

694
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,240
compared to the lateral root and that's

695
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,759
that's the main pipes that are doing the

696
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,120
transport and you can see the blue

697
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:23,119
things there's huge difference in the

698
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,639
number and the surface of the vessels

699
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,239
that are doing the transport. So that's

700
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,038
already an assumption that is wrong that

701
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,319
we need to correct and also the number

702
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,319
of the the cortex layers and all of the

703
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,720
cells that needs to be not only built

704
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,879
but also maintained as the root system

705
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,880
architecture is growing. So right now

706
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,880
what we're doing is we're doing so Emily

707
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,600
and Trend have been really amazing in

708
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,080
collecting all of the root sections for

709
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,119
the main roots and the latter roots.

710
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,119
Those are the best pictures I could get.

711
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,519
It's very hard to kind of get them get

712
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,398
them really nice. And we're quantifying

713
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,319
basically all of the the vascule, the

714
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,119
surface area of the cortex, the

715
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,000
endodermis, epidermis, and the xylm

716
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,599
bundle sheet cells. And we can see that

717
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
between the lateral root and the main

718
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,240
root, there are tremendous differences.

719
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,200
And also there are differences in the

720
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,960
developmental stage as well. So your

721
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,440
bundles are very looking very different

722
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,360
at the root tip compared to the very

723
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
mature root. And at some point we also

724
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,319
are starting to have the secondary

725
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,480
growth which is specific to dicots. Uh

726
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,599
so right now together with Arjun and

727
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,240
Guiam Lo from from Belgium we are

728
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,359
integrating all of those physiologically

729
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,880
quite relevant features into our Pareto

730
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:43,439
front optimality metrics and then using

731
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,520
those adjusted models we're going to

732
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,159
recalculate everything for our entire

733
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,079
diversity panel and then use that to run

734
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,679
the genomide association and hopefully

735
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,038
we're going to learn a little bit more

736
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,640
like which genes are involved in um

737
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,480
optimal small root system architecture

738
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,759
or optimizing the cost or the transport

739
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,919
rate. The other thing that I want to

740
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:07,440
just briefly mention, so this is there's

741
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,159
a it's a happy news. Uh recently we have

742
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,720
been awarded together with a a bunch of

743
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,000
really amazing collaborators from from

744
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,480
BTI this FF grant. So we've got Sylvia

745
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,159
Restrepo, Jim Jovanoni, Julian Fay from

746
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,679
our tech technology transfer office. Uh

747
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,080
Gagan from um myiogenics and Zangjin

748
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,120
Feay is really like the the the the lead

749
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,960
brain in here. And basically what we're

750
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,918
going to do is we're going to screen the

751
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,919
wide tomato diversity panel for drought

752
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,880
stress tolerance. So Sylvia is going to

753
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,720
do that for for a bio for a for a biotic

754
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,080
stress. I'm really going to talk only

755
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,278
about the the drought because that's

756
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,519
that's what I know. So in here, so we so

757
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,440
far we only have focused on liopers and

758
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,599
pimpleium, but there is so many more

759
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,080
tomatoes. So that's what we want to

760
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,519
really screen like, okay, are there much

761
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:02,079
more cool diversity strategies for all

762
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,398
of those different things. So as you can

763
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,398
think about like drought is a complex

764
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,798
trait. If we just measure like, well, do

765
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,678
they survive or do they wilt? We're

766
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,558
again throwing a lot of a lot of

767
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,200
complexity into genetics. So how are we

768
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,359
going to dissect it? And dissection is

769
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,640
going through isolation of individual

770
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,558
feeds. So we're going to dissect it into

771
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,038
daily use of water, maintenance of

772
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,960
growth rate, plant health indices, and

773
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,960
photosynthetic efficiency. And that's a

774
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,840
combination of the tools that my lab has

775
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,399
developed as well as phenocite. So I

776
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,879
hope that this is just providing you an

777
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,479
overview of what are the tools that are

778
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,320
available and if you want to use some of

779
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,798
them just let us know and then we can

780
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,639
either borrow you some of our cool toys

781
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,000
because that's the best thing of like

782
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,840
having cool toys is sharing them or uh

783
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,240
we can we can help you with setting up

784
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,398
your experiment for the FIMO site. So

785
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
the first toy that was developed

786
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,759
actually by Olga Millinsky who is now a

787
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,640
PhD student in plant path uh but was an

788
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,119
amazing undergraduate student is this

789
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,759
device that's called Osmo. So Osmo is a

790
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:13,519
little Arduino. Uh it's a computer

791
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:16,079
that's costing $20 and we put that in a

792
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,158
box with an LED screen and it's

793
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,240
connected to a scale and a little water

794
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,640
pump. This is how it looks in real life.

795
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,278
So, we put all of the mess of the cables

796
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,600
in a box and we connect that to the

797
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,079
laptop. Basically, how it works is you

798
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,079
hardcode all of the reference data for

799
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,558
the weight of your plants onto the

800
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,558
Arduino. And then you have the plants

801
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,000
that are mixed with drought control and

802
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,918
you know that your control plants should

803
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,679
be watered to that specific reference

804
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,960
weight. Your drought should be watered

805
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,038
to let's say 100 grams less. Right? So

806
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,798
you put your plant pot number one and

807
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,200
it's already hardcoded that pot number

808
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,440
one is control. It says oh okay your

809
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,960
reference weight is below the ref like

810
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,558
your measured weight is below the

811
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,200
reference weight. Therefore I need to

812
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:01,759
activate the pump. Pump activated. Okay

813
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,200
fine. Measure the weight again. Okay.

814
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,839
Now the weight is above the reference

815
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,399
weight. Click this button and then I can

816
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,079
do the pot number two. And so it goes.

817
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,199
And if you connect this little device

818
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,599
into a Windowsbased laptop, h because it

819
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,798
doesn't work on anything else,

820
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,319
unfortunately, but it will also record

821
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,798
all of the weight before and after

822
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,278
watering, which gives you cheap but

823
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,278
dirty evapor transpiration data that you

824
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,038
can get. So this evapor transpiration

825
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,278
here I've got an example of cowpie

826
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,038
plants that we have exposed to control

827
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,919
and drought conditions and this is the

828
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,839
average evapo transpiration rate. uh we

829
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,440
can see that definitely under control

830
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,678
and drought stress we've got a decrease

831
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,840
and we also can see differences between

832
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,919
the individual genotypes in their in

833
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,480
their evapo transpiration. So again this

834
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,880
is a very dirty trait but it's helping

835
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,120
us provide to all of the plants exactly

836
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,000
the same drought stress treatment and

837
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,398
gets us data that is kind of for free.

838
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,440
Then we're going into the maintenance of

839
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,959
the growth rate. So for this

840
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,759
um we've got uh we have built something

841
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,759
that's called the pheno cage. So as long

842
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,278
as you're not working with arabidopsis

843
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,960
turns out that plants have 3D

844
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,839
architecture and you kind of have to

845
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,000
like image them from all sides. So what

846
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,879
we did is we did exactly that. So we're

847
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,440
putting a plant by hand on this little

848
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,039
display rotating ring that we bought off

849
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,038
Amazon and it's meant for displaying

850
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,798
jewelry in the shop. But it's also doing

851
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,839
a great job at displaying plants in the

852
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,519
growth chamber. So this is the picture

853
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,519
how the plant looks like. And again this

854
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,839
is an example of the cowpie because the

855
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,919
technician that is starting the the the

856
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:44,959
work on the FFIR started this week. Um

857
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,640
so this uh the plant is uh is turning

858
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,038
and we're taking seven consecutive

859
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,038
images and we're doing it every every

860
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,960
three days or so and then afterwards

861
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,359
we're analyzing the images because we've

862
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,440
got a nice white background. we can

863
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,678
quite easily separate the planned bits

864
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,919
from the background bits and have that

865
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,120
as a projected shoot area. So the number

866
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,320
is totally artificial but it can it does

867
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,159
give you the increase in the size of the

868
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,000
plants throughout the time in a

869
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,679
non-destructive way and you can

870
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,079
absolutely differentiate again the

871
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,679
control is blue here the drought is red

872
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
you can differentiate between your

873
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,760
control grown plants and drought stress

874
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,598
grown plants based on this data we can

875
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,359
calculate the growth rate throughout the

876
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,039
experiments for each of the genotypes

877
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,519
which we have done in here and again

878
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,239
this is for copy and you can see like

879
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:35,918
okay so here I've But overall my

880
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,479
population kind of decreased by 50%. But

881
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,239
I can also do it genotype specific and I

882
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,079
can say okay which genotypes are

883
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,158
performing relatively well. So close to

884
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,079
one or some of them are above one which

885
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,720
are suspicious. Um but uh and which of

886
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,359
my genotypes are extremely tolerant and

887
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,799
this whole setup in general is costing

888
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,799
like $200 to build up. So I built it up

889
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,119
before we had a big fancy phenotyping

890
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,599
facility set up and because we needed to

891
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,599
collect some data but uh it's a very

892
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,079
it's a very cost-effective way of

893
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,640
getting the data out of your of your

894
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
natural diversity panel and identifying

895
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,799
which genotypes are of high high

896
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,480
interest. Right? Then we're getting to

897
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,440
fancy stuff. So screening for plant

898
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,280
health indices. So we're uh we're able

899
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,320
with phenocytes. So this is this is

900
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,040
using our fancy uh cool uh phenotyping

901
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,519
facility at the BTI. So we're able to

902
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,639
using a

903
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:36,960
multi-spectral camera. We are able to uh

904
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,960
isolate the NDVI indices as well as

905
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,358
anttosyin and chlorophyll index. So here

906
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,358
you've got the tomato plant growing.

907
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,400
You've got the color images. You can see

908
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,639
the NDVI index, chlorophyll index and uh

909
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,119
anttoscin index. And you can see that

910
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:54,319
they are changing at the different time

911
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,079
points. And I've got an example of a of

912
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,599
a experiment that we have done with

913
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,280
tomatoes exposed to two different

914
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,160
treatments represented by two different

915
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,519
colors. And you can see that chlorophyll

916
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,440
index, anttoscin index and

917
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:10,079
NDVI are showing a very different

918
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,599
pattern throughout the time. So again

919
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,599
really it's and some of them are

920
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,480
somewhat related. So the h the

921
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,559
anthocyanin and chlorophyll index are

922
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,240
showing some similarities but not not

923
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,159
always because there is this very early

924
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,078
time point that this guys goes up and

925
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,078
here nothing is really happening. So

926
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,560
you're really able to to look at the

927
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,160
plant as if through different angles and

928
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,679
different strategies isolate those

929
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,519
different strategies more effectively.

930
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:37,039
Then we've got things that are having to

931
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,039
do with chlorophyll fluorescent and

932
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,960
photosynthesis. So I don't know how

933
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,358
about you but my photosynthesis was

934
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,199
rusty before I started to work with this

935
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,400
machine. So I'm going to explain it to

936
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:51,039
you. So what is happening? We're able to

937
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,800
only extract the data that is related to

938
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,320
photos system 2. So photo system 2 is

939
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,720
the one that is like absorbing most of

940
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,519
the light. So what's happening? You've

941
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,519
got a lot of electrons going. What we

942
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,039
need to do first is we need to adapt our

943
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,119
plants to dark. So all of those

944
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,759
electrons are like can chilled freak

945
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,039
out. So they chill out for 15 minutes

946
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,000
and then we put the plant under a camera

947
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,599
and then we put a tiny flash and then we

948
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,599
can measure the minimum fluoresence and

949
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,760
then we make then we put them under like

950
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,359
a super saturating flash so we can

951
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,280
measure the maximum fluoresence. So this

952
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,119
is the maximum amount of the light that

953
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,880
the chlorophyll can like shine back at

954
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,280
us. Fine. Maximum minus minimum is FV

955
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,400
which is the variable fluoresence. FV

956
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,720
over FM is quantum yield max. So maximum

957
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,320
yield of your quantum yield of photo

958
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,759
system 2, right? Cool. All right. Then

959
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,720
what we're doing is we're switching the

960
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,720
light back on under the camera. We let

961
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,199
it adapt. We see a kowski effect and

962
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,679
that's basically related to all of those

963
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,639
all of those photons are like either

964
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,480
like shown back or slowly they are being

965
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,559
integrated into the photosynthetic

966
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,639
machinery and that's whenever they are

967
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,279
that's why we're seeing this drop in the

968
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,879
chloro fllororesence. Then again we're

969
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,280
adding this like super saturating

970
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,200
flashing and then we're measuring again

971
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,119
minimum maximum fluoresence and again we

972
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,719
can qu quantify the quantum yield but

973
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,400
it's not maximum quantum yield because

974
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,159
you can see this quantum yield is so

975
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,200
much smaller. So once we've got that we

976
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:23,039
can calculate non photochemical

977
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,639
quenching based on the differences from

978
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,880
our light adapted chlorophyll

979
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,519
fluorescent and dark adapted and

980
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,800
photochemical quenching based on all of

981
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,880
the other stuff. So there's a lot of

982
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,160
data that we're collecting and we can do

983
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,599
ratios and all of this cool stuff.

984
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:42,719
Anyways, so long story short is and

985
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,400
again we've got images of color and then

986
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,559
we can superimpose all of those

987
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,480
calculations onto individual pixels in

988
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,119
the plant and we can see like oh but

989
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,719
there is something happening to those

990
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,880
leaves that are really suffering at some

991
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,719
point and how is that looking how is

992
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,480
this suffering looking at at different

993
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,039
traits and again we're seeing very very

994
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,480
different trends. So in here again we've

995
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,480
got experiment of the tomatoes uh over

996
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,519
the time and you can see that the FV

997
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,000
over FM is differing at some point but

998
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,079
then it comes back. So that shows you

999
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,400
really the value of looking at dynamic

1000
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,760
systems and looking as close as possible

1001
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,200
because otherwise if we would measure

1002
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,320
only here and here we would be saying

1003
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,000
like FV over FM not changing but because

1004
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
we're looking through time we can see

1005
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,320
like no there's actually things

1006
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,118
happening. FQ over FM which is the light

1007
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,280
adapted quantum yield it's not really

1008
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,119
different whatsoever and we can see that

1009
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,440
non-photochemical quenching there is

1010
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,440
some variation and there are some points

1011
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,440
where this is significant the

1012
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,838
differences between our treatment but

1013
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,358
the data is a little bit messier here

1014
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:50,039
but again allows us to dissect all of

1015
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:53,119
those those responses into

1016
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:55,358
individual categories and what and for

1017
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,119
me I'm not interested in learning more

1018
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:02,000
about NPQ V over FM for me as a root

1019
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:04,400
biologist I use those to to indicate is

1020
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,639
my plant okay is my plant doing well. So

1021
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,880
this is my fitness rather than waiting

1022
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:11,118
and growing my plants all the way to the

1023
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,119
seed and counting the seeds that my

1024
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,680
plant is producing because as we as I

1025
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,400
told you before natural diversity panel

1026
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,159
that thing is complicated but if I do

1027
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,160
that at the same moment that I'm looking

1028
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:26,639
at my roots maybe this is this is this

1029
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:28,879
can be a useful data. So before I have

1030
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,719
two slides, no three slides left. So

1031
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,800
just summarizing the phenocide features

1032
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,559
and capabilities, we can image up to one

1033
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,480
meter tall plants, which is three foot

1034
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,599
for the people that don't like metrics.

1035
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,400
Uh we have a capacity of 64 large

1036
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,000
plants. So we have grown citrus trees,

1037
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,240
we have grown tomatoes, we have grown

1038
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,880
beans, we have grown sataria. Sataria is

1039
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,759
a tricky one, but we can um we have

1040
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,160
grown arabidopsis. And for arabidopsis

1041
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,480
we can actually grow 20 plants in one of

1042
00:40:54,159 --> 00:41:01,838
the tray which increases our capacity to

1043
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,119
1,280 plants. Um so we have RGB imaging

1044
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:04,880
that is masked with chlorophyll

1045
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,039
fluoresence which is allowing us to do

1046
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880
automatic calculation of the plant size

1047
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:12,000
and the growth rate. We also have

1048
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,160
photosynthetic efficiencies indices and

1049
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,318
high precision watering and fertilizing.

1050
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,000
So we don't need to come and water those

1051
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,000
plants because the machine does it for

1052
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,920
us. How cool is that?

1053
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,358
So, how do I get to how do you get to

1054
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,680
use it? I know how to use it. Uh, so I

1055
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,679
left couple of stickers uh next to the

1056
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,078
coffee area. So, if you go on the

1057
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,000
website, there is a project intake form

1058
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,079
available. So, you can download it. You

1059
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
can fill it up to as much as you as much

1060
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,039
as you can. Sometimes you don't really

1061
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,880
know what you want, but it gives us a

1062
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,719
good starting point for a discussion.

1063
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,440
So, once we've got this form filled up

1064
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:49,838
as much as possible, then we've got a

1065
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,679
meeting. So it's the the the the person

1066
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,838
that is doing the experiment. It's me

1067
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,480
and it's Julie Bell from the greenhouse

1068
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,400
facilities and BTI just to kind of make

1069
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,318
sure that the greenhouse facilities can

1070
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,318
provide the conditions that you need for

1071
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,480
your experiments that we are not

1072
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,159
overpromising you so that we can track

1073
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,719
the movement of the microbes in your

1074
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:13,199
plant. We cannot do that. Um but um so

1075
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,959
then once once we've got that done,

1076
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,199
we've got a project agreement proposed

1077
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,318
with the costs. We grow the plants

1078
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,719
within the dedicated uh BTI phenotyping

1079
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,119
facility and what we provide you with is

1080
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,279
your raw data but also some level of

1081
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,960
pre-analyzeed data in R. So basically

1082
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,119
the same graphs that I showed you in the

1083
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,639
previous slides where you've got the

1084
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,400
changes throughout the time and also

1085
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,239
those p values like when are they

1086
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,000
starting to to be significantly

1087
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,598
different from each other. We already

1088
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,318
have pipelines for that so you don't

1089
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,720
have to figure it out. Um and you know

1090
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,400
we can we can keep on collaborating like

1091
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,000
whether you want to have something else

1092
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,480
maybe you want to have like one leaf

1093
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,358
analyzed uh per in in your in your in

1094
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,039
your experiment rather than the whole

1095
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:56,799
canopy. Uh we can also provide you with

1096
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,318
the snapshot data. So if you've got

1097
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,359
plants growing preferably in the

1098
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:04,079
greenhouse of BTI because we have had

1099
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,318
some insect introduction from the gutmen

1100
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,640
recently. So we would like to avoid

1101
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:11,599
that. Um so if you grow the plants

1102
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,440
within the facility you can come in and

1103
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,160
we can open the machine and just make

1104
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,519
one snapshot data individually. Riley

1105
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,239
has done that. So if you've got any

1106
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,719
questions for her user experience uh

1107
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,479
please please come and talk to her or

1108
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:29,439
me. Um and then kind of summing up my

1109
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,358
entire talk of today. So some few

1110
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,880
take-home messages. So I think studying

1111
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:37,519
stress resilient plants um like wild and

1112
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,240
cultivated tomato can can provide new

1113
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:43,199
new strategies for improved uh

1114
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:45,279
performance uh under under very bad

1115
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,639
conditions. So you have prioritizing

1116
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,960
different components of root system

1117
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,039
architecture can be combined to further

1118
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,639
improve the tolerance and also there are

1119
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,800
new ways we're working on the new ways

1120
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,078
of quantifying the roots because we

1121
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,519
looked at those at those natural

1122
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,920
diversity panels and we have not

1123
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,480
observed Christmas tree broomstick and

1124
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,480
the telephone polaropsis we only have

1125
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,760
started to think about it how are we

1126
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,960
going to describe those root system

1127
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,040
architectures by working with tomatoes

1128
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,880
um I hope that I showed you a couple of

1129
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,039
costefficient phenotyping tools that you

1130
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,240
can either build yourself or we can help

1131
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:20,559
you build them uh with you uh to

1132
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,719
identify uh drought stress responses but

1133
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,960
they can be used for identifying any

1134
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,078
responses if you're working on pathogens

1135
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,240
probably also quite useful or or or

1136
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,599
nutrient

1137
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:34,078
availability and hopefully with the

1138
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,000
phenocite uh we can provide you with a

1139
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,079
little bit more depth in your

1140
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,440
environmental response and quantifying

1141
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,839
that environmental response.

1142
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,240
So this is all that I wanted to mention.

1143
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,880
Of course this work wouldn't be possible

1144
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,838
without the amazing lab members that I

1145
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,760
had plenty of fantastic collaborators

1146
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,400
and also I wanted to give a big shout

1147
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,200
out to the uh BTI plant growth facility

1148
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,960
team. They have been very very great in

1149
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,799
helping me deal with the monster that

1150
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,318
the phenocite uh is uh is is sometimes

1151
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,839
and it's sometimes giving us a lot of

1152
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,159
headaches but we're figuring out

1153
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,960
together and we're making it we're

1154
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,519
making it work. Um and of course the

1155
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,000
work on the pimpleum initially started

1156
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,480
in caused in the group of this guy Mark

1157
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,920
Tester and I was lucky enough that I

1158
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,400
could take a lot of it with me. Um, and

1159
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,159
thank you for your attention and I'm

1160
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,559
happy to hear any questions.

1161
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,399
I have a question. I came to I have a

1162
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,599
couple of questions. I kept saying we

1163
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,200
don't really know how water is taking.

1164
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,160
So my question is what do you mean by

1165
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:46,000
that? And the second question is what

1166
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:48,960
role are you looking also at the role of

1167
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,760
uh endodies?

1168
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,838
Absolutely. Yes. Great question. Yes.

1169
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,319
Yes. So yes, I will repeat the question.

1170
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,759
So the question is what do I mean by the

1171
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:01,358
fact that we don't know how water is

1172
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,200
being taken up and the second is uh what

1173
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,799
are are we including endodermis

1174
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:08,559
exodermis in our water calculation. So

1175
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,240
um both of the question are pertaining

1176
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:11,838
in the like the cross-sections that

1177
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,879
we're collecting of the latch roots and

1178
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,719
main roots and uh in including them in

1179
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,960
the parto front. So yes, we are

1180
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,480
including endodermis exodermis. By the

1181
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,440
time that I was making this figures, we

1182
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,880
haven't done the stainings yet for the

1183
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,280
superization. But yes, we are we know

1184
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,079
that the exodermis is forming first,

1185
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,800
endo endodermises forming later. So we

1186
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,519
are we are including them in the in the

1187
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,440
in the tomato. Nobody has ever done

1188
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,119
looked at the exodermis and endodermis

1189
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,960
formation in the lateral roots, which is

1190
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,039
mind-blowing to me that nobody has done

1191
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,760
that. But knowing how difficult it is to

1192
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,519
get those lat roots cross-sections, I

1193
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,280
start understanding why nobody has done

1194
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,440
that because those roots are very

1195
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,839
finicky. So, we're embedding it in the

1196
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,760
in the plastic resin, which is which is

1197
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,358
as as you probably know, a bit of a

1198
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,240
pain.

1199
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,920
Can you stain the whole crosssection?

1200
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,679
Can we stain the whole root without a

1201
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,599
cross-section? Uh it might

1202
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,639
be we could we could potentially but

1203
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,160
because we already have the

1204
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,960
cross-sections might as well just stay

1205
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:15,358
in those cross-sections. uh the so okay

1206
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,280
so I answered your second question first

1207
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,598
now let's go back what do I mean by we

1208
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,680
don't know how water is being taken up

1209
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,400
um well we know roots that's short

1210
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:28,078
answer but if you think about okay so

1211
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,960
and I I have been having a lot of

1212
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,440
conversations with yam and people in lon

1213
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,679
that are developing a lot of like water

1214
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,800
transport models so you would think that

1215
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,879
they know the question is as is majority

1216
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,680
of the water being taken up by the root

1217
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,200
tips

1218
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:47,199
or throughout oh sorry throughout the uh

1219
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:48,838
the main the main root. So m majority of

1220
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,799
the models are actually developed using

1221
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:55,279
monocots monocots they have um they have

1222
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,039
what the the the vascule is changing and

1223
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,760
the the conductivity is changing. So

1224
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:03,679
you've got axial conductivity and ra no

1225
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,119
radial conductivity and axial

1226
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,919
conductivity right so axial conduct no

1227
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,400
radial conductivity is decreasing with

1228
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,639
the with the age of the root

1229
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,559
and axial conductivity is increasing

1230
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,598
right so the older roots are kind of

1231
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,440
becoming more pipes rather than

1232
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:26,559
absorbent right and that's that's for

1233
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,559
monocots and the monocots don't show any

1234
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,800
um any change in the root

1235
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:34,640
diameter. Dicodes on the other hand they

1236
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,240
we do have secondary growth in the

1237
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:40,558
docodes. So they have and Marco and

1238
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,318
Marco is a PhD student of Guiam. Marco

1239
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,200
hates me for that because I forced them

1240
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:47,599
to develop those models for tomato and

1241
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,960
they're like well in mono inots we've

1242
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:54,000
got secondary growth so your diameter is

1243
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,599
not changing. So even though you've got

1244
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,239
axial conductivity, no sorry radial,

1245
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,079
yes, radio conductivity decreasing

1246
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:04,439
because you've got those endodermal

1247
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,440
things, you've got more woody stuff

1248
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,440
happening and so forth. Your diameter is

1249
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,960
increasing and the increase of that

1250
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,159
diameter is sufficient for kind of

1251
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,960
counteracting that that effect that

1252
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,639
we're seeing in the monocots. So the the

1253
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,280
thick roots and D cuts are absorbing

1254
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,159
just as much as the thin roots according

1255
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,040
to their models. So we're trying to kind

1256
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,799
of like see what's happening if we what

1257
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,440
can we learn from the model into the

1258
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,440
real life and can we just grow plants

1259
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,119
with thick

1260
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,880
roots and just chop off those main root

1261
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,358
merist stems because we apparently don't

1262
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,599
need them but I think we still do. So,

1263
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,119
so that's that's what I mean by we we

1264
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,880
don't really know how the water is being

1265
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,960
taken up because we don't know what

1266
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,920
features are the most I mean we do need

1267
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,159
we do know that features like cortex are

1268
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,079
not c number of cortex layers it's not

1269
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,159
really playing much of a difference the

1270
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,800
number and the size of the exylm vessels

1271
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,558
is endodermis exodermis is absolutely

1272
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,640
playing the majority of the of the of

1273
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,400
the big uh big pictures um but uh but we

1274
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,318
don't know how how it's working with the

1275
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,240
root diameters increasing because all of

1276
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,800
the sudden and things are being like

1277
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,159
it's not Yeah. And it's in the way it's

1278
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
good that they developed all of those

1279
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,399
models on monocodes because it's a

1280
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,599
simple

1281
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,720
system and now we're going we're

1282
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,800
upgrading into the D codes.

1283
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,679
Um yeah, sure. I had a question about

1284
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,280
the two um tomatoes and the cross. Yes.

1285
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,639
I was wondering um was there any

1286
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,720
differences in associations with um

1287
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:37,118
microisals microisal associations and

1288
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,959
the cross? Does that change it? Okay. So

1289
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,480
Claire is asking whether there is a

1290
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,039
difference between the microisal

1291
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,920
association. We have grown those plants

1292
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:48,639
in the sterile conditions on the augur

1293
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,119
plate. So we don't know at all with the

1294
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:53,118
microisal associations. They are

1295
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,000
performing both equally well when we

1296
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,559
grow them in the soil. Uh we don't we

1297
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,880
don't incubate any microisal communities

1298
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,800
at all. But I assume that they just

1299
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,240
emerge. I don't know anything about

1300
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,240
microisa. So um I see potentially there

1301
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,479
there is definitely potential there but

1302
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,000
we haven't studied it yet. So if you

1303
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,159
want to have some seeds we can totally

1304
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,280
give you

1305
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:20,000
Sam um I was wondering so you have the

1306
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,400
differences um in the root architecture.

1307
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,960
Can you speak up? I can't hear you. Um

1308
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,519
in the hybrid line do you see a

1309
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,079
difference in the Ross accumulation? We

1310
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,838
have So Sam is asking whether we see

1311
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,318
differences in the Ross accumulation in

1312
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,558
the F1 hybrid. We have not looked at

1313
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:40,639
that because we had so few seeds of the

1314
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,480
F1 and we haven't sent it to to Ron um

1315
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,480
because we were like well how about we

1316
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,079
establish this protocol because they

1317
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,599
haven't done the roots before because

1318
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,960
they were like oh roots there's a lot of

1319
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,800
out of fllororesence we don't do roots

1320
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,079
we only do shoots I'm like roots are

1321
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,680
cool so um and we see huge differences

1322
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,280
in the stress response between the roots

1323
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,358
and the shoots so hopefully hopefully

1324
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,519
now we convince them uh but that's

1325
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,000
that's a great idea to do that on the on

1326
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,639
the F1 I don't No, and we haven't done

1327
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,719
RNA sec on the F1 as well, which would

1328
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,960
be another way of kind of helping us

1329
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,519
figuring out the not the cy the cyst and

1330
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,599
the trans of it all, but also like which

1331
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:18,159
of the responses are are dominant from

1332
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,119
which genotype? Yeah, great idea. Thank

1333
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,440
you.

1334
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,160
Yes, John.

1335
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:31,280
So how would you determine that the

1336
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:34,078
change architecture is actually adapted

1337
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,240
like a full saw to yes how do you know

1338
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,960
that this change it's not a consequence

1339
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,519
of stress yes you know damage yeah yeah

1340
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,920
yeah okay so Jan is asking whether how

1341
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,679
are we going to identify whether change

1342
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,440
in the root system architecture is an

1343
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,838
adaptive response we don't we don't we

1344
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,039
don't know yet so we are we're assuming

1345
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,358
that natural variation and we assume

1346
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,119
that the maintenance of the growth is

1347
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,838
something that is adaptive over the long

1348
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,400
term because if you've got roots that

1349
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:06,400
are growing and I think Jose didn't deny

1350
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,318
published on that if you've got roots

1351
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,240
that are kind of keep on growing

1352
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:13,039
throughout the stress exposure and they

1353
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,118
don't stop and think they typically the

1354
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:17,599
meristem activity is decreasing

1355
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,559
afterwards. So we don't we are focusing

1356
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,480
on the maintain meristm activity and

1357
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,720
hopefully that is allowing us to then

1358
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,960
say like okay well if you've got after a

1359
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,799
week of stress if you still keep on

1360
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,119
growing it means that okay you can you

1361
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,119
can survive that and we're also going

1362
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,800
away we're we're working with the stress

1363
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,800
concentrations that are as

1364
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,720
physiologically relevant as possible. So

1365
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,880
we're working on 75 max 125 millolar

1366
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,838
salt stress. So, we're we're trying to

1367
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,680
stay away from osmotic shock. Uh because

1368
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:51,318
that's I think that's also not how salt

1369
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,159
stress is typically occurring in the

1370
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:55,759
wild. Um but yeah, we don't we don't

1371
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:59,039
know and that's also one of the reasons

1372
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,640
that that we want to add the we still a

1373
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:04,159
lot of the stuff that I have presented

1374
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:06,318
is a very descriptive studies. Um so we

1375
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,159
are going to identify the genes and once

1376
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:09,719
we add the genes then we can say is it

1377
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,078
adaptive is it not

1378
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,439
adaptive. But yeah, a very good question

1379
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,519
and it's definitely something that we

1380
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,119
that we have to keep in mind like the

1381
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,759
fact that things are changing or like

1382
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,318
stopping growing it's it's not

1383
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,720
necessarily a good thing but maintenance

1384
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:28,159
of growth we we are assuming that that's

1385
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:33,399
that's what the plant want

1386
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,399
time so let's think thank you so much
