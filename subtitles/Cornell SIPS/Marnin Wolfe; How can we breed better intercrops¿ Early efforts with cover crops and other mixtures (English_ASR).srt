1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,359
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,359
University.

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,678
Okay. Okay. Um well, first of all, um

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,160
thank you so much, Jenny, and also to

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,118
Salvig for inviting me to be here. Um

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,039
joining me around. Um I'm I'm just

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,118
hugely excited to get to talk to this

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,560
particular group. Jenny's had lots of

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:29,439
familiar faces, so many that aren't. Um

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,479
so all I will tell you about like my

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,880
background

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,799
um h ah okay right so um the reason that

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,200
I was here from 2013 to um 2022 actually

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,519
I was here for about six years then then

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
moved remote um but I worked on the next

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,800
generation cassava breeding program was

17
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,959
hired by Jean Luke in 2013 and it was

18
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,558
really the time of my life I I well it

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,558
was the time of my life and I fell in

20
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,558
love with plant breeding and um so I am

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,280
doing some so I I suppose I was working

22
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,599
on food security um providing decision

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,799
support to plantreeders in the cassava

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,039
breeding project mainly during that time

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,040
and what I've done now is shift gears a

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
little bit trying to run my own breeding

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
program and uh my focus is on cover

28
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
crops and maybe breeding for

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,320
sustainability aspects in our cropping

30
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,400
systems. So, I am at Auburn University

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,399
now. Um, Auburn is all the way down

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
here. Uh, we're kind of west of of

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
Atlanta. We're in central eastern

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,200
Alabama. We're the land grant institute

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,799
for Alabama. So, um, I was appointed as

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,759
assistant professor of quantitative

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,920
genetics, which means I can basically

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,159
work on whichever cropping systems that

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,799
are funding uh that are fundable and

40
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,439
that are supported by stakeholders. Um,

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,759
and there's a lot of um, uh, motivation

42
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,398
and work around cover cropping as well

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,640
as forages in Alabama. So, I've set up

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,599
myself as the Auburn University's cover

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,079
crop and forage breeding lab and trying

46
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,399
to support southeastern growers. But the

47
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,399
research focus that I kind of have taken

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
on is breeding for intercropping. And

49
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,759
that's what I'm mainly going to talk

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
about today. So, um, I have really been

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,799
starting a breeding program from scratch

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,039
at Auburn. Um there were several

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,719
successful forage breeders in previous

54
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,439
years at Auburn University that have

55
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,759
developed especially forage legume um

56
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,159
varieties and germ plasm. So my kind of

57
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,719
first job was but but that the last one

58
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,878
had retired in 2016. So my kind of first

59
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,039
job was exploring the cauldron and

60
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,518
trying to figure out what kind of germ

61
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,120
plasm we have grow um lying around and

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,439
and what will actually grow. So, um, one

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,800
of the cool things taking on cover crops

64
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,759
and forages is I get to work on probably

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,599
too many different species. Um, however,

66
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,598
I'm going to focus today and and just

67
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,280
talk to you about um my sort of primary

68
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,598
species that I'm I'm loving to work

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,640
with, which is crimson clover. Uh, this

70
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,560
is trifolium incarnatum. It's uh not

71
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,119
super common around this region, but

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,479
it's uh just um well, it is super common

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,400
where where I sit. Um, and uh, we've

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,479
we've had several releases of crimson

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
clover from Auburn University in the

76
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,479
past. So, we had germ plasm to get

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
started with. It's it's actually like

78
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,919
the lead cover crop legume in the US, at

79
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,479
least according to like SAR cover crop

80
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,958
surveys. Um, importantly, and I honestly

81
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,439
didn't appreciate this fact until I took

82
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
on work in this area, it's a cool season

83
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,959
legume and it's alaganis, which means

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,080
we're breeding an open pollinated

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,680
species here. We do know there's some

86
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,640
self-compatibility in crimson clover.

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,599
Um, but basically those are my problems

88
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,518
now to figure out how to navigate. We

89
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,359
don't really have genomic resources in

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,000
crimson clover. There's one study

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,720
published in the past with AFL markers

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
in the species. So we're working um I'm

93
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,519
not going to talk much about it today,

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
but one of the things we are working to

95
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,519
do build a crimson clover reference

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
genome uh develop some do some

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,438
resequencing try to understand the

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,680
population genetics um in this species.

99
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,919
Um now before I go into like the actual

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
work we're doing, I'd say the most

101
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,839
tangible real thing that I I do and have

102
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,399
done in the last couple years is is grow

103
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,720
a team that that work with me. Um we're

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,719
we're currently seven uh we have two I

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,840
have two PhD students working with them

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,000
me with me two master's students um and

107
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,758
also an undergrad Anthony who's actually

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,279
going to start a master's degree in just

109
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,080
a couple of months um and um a postoc uh

110
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,719
Cynthia Go started um in September of

111
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,959
last year. So I am really fortunate to

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
get to work with these folks. Um several

113
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,198
of them actually came out of the cassava

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
breeding and genetics world. So we kind

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
of speak the same language which is

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,960
cool. Um, but we are we're a little bit

117
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,879
of a diverse group. Um, also, um, just

118
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,959
to say before I go on, starting a

119
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,519
breeding program and and learning from

120
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,638
the angle I came at all of this was was

121
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,639
not as a plantreeder. Um, maybe more of

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,000
a molecular breeder, let's say. Um, so

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,600
starting a breeding program that

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,918
includes fieldwork and that kind of

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
thing takes a lot of help. Have to ask a

126
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,758
lot of questions and depend on a lot of

127
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,918
people. So, um I'm not going to try to

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,038
name names, but um I'm I'm very

129
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,399
fortunate to work with amazing people um

130
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,560
including the cover crop breeding

131
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,038
network, which I'll mention um in just a

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,478
moment. Um starting breeding program

133
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,038
also takes funding and I've been

134
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,918
fortunate in the last few years. Um we

135
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,079
have an Alabama egg experimental fund

136
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,079
that had some helped us pilot some of

137
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,639
this work. Um we've actually gotten some

138
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,240
funds from Alabama cotton um cotton

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
commission and wheat and feed gains

140
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
check off. So they're supporting

141
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,879
covercrop breeding activities at least

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,439
so far. You have two USDA NIFA projects

143
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,759
that are supporting the intercropping

144
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,519
work I'm going to talk about today. JGI

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
is helping us develop clover genomic

146
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,879
resources and two of my grad students

147
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,879
have grad stu um s grad student grants.

148
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,800
So that's been really tremendous to help

149
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,360
us get started.

150
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,600
So, um, and importantly talking about

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
needing a lot of help, I've partnered up

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,319
with the Cover Crop Breeding Network,

153
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,560
um, who I'm more or less assume this

154
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,800
audience knows about the, uh, this this

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,959
organization, but it's led by very own

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,319
Jenny Moore, coordinated by Salt Lake

157
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:23,839
Hansen. Um, a great community sort of

158
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,080
um, putting me with a a group like I I

159
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,478
was working with with NextGen Cassava, I

160
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,959
would say. Um and actually so I I

161
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,360
started by just planting uh you know a

162
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,799
rep of of a advanced line field trial

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
two years ago and and they actually

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,038
asked me to be the crimson clover um

165
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,120
breeding lead for the network and that

166
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,719
puts me into a position I'm actually a

167
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,639
little more familiar with. I provide

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
decision support to the various breeders

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,680
in the project. I haven't mentioned we

170
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,279
so we're uh a collaborative of

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
plantreeders, aronomists, soil

172
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,879
scientists. We're all collectively

173
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,360
working to develop improved varieties uh

174
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,120
for cover cropping. We have three legume

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,879
species that we focus on. Winter pee,

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
Harry veetch, my favorite, crimson

177
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,120
clover. We also have a serial rye

178
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,400
breeding program and we have a winter

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,879
canola program as well. So each species

180
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,120
has one or more different uh breeding

181
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,439
nurseries at different sites across the

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,918
nation with breeders focused on those

183
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,639
particular populations. So my role is

184
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,240
really to uh sort of crunch the data and

185
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
provide decision support when they need

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,879
to make gulling or advancement decisions

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,959
as well as I am now doing that for my

188
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,519
own crimson clover breeding program

189
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,680
which has been really great. Oh, in case

190
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,918
I forget or I shouldn't forget to

191
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
actually mention cover crops are those

192
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,159
that we're planting to benefit the soil

193
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,799
and the subsequent crop rather than for

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,199
harvesting. So these are uh crops that

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
we're growing to benefit the soil. um

196
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,919
they have a myriad of different

197
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,478
potential benefits when you optimize

198
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,680
them depending on what your goals are.

199
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,318
So um usually I classify uh the benefits

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,720
of cover cropping as services sometimes

201
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
called ecosystem services suppressing

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
weeds, scavenging nitrogen, helping to

203
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,598
benefit um prevent erosion, those kinds

204
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,598
of things or at least have been in the

205
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,399
past economic incentives that also

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,519
support farmers to um to plant cover

207
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,799
crops. The benefits of cover crops are

208
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,719
some of them are you can see them

209
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
immediately, right? Like having a cover

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,840
crop residue can prevent a wash out when

211
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
you have heavy rains in the early season

212
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,079
and many of them you have to practice

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,800
for a long time to build up soil organic

214
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,759
carbon or improve the aggregate um of

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,639
your soil. So long and short-term

216
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,360
benefits aside, those um are the reasons

217
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,598
that

218
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,800
oops, come on. Cover crop acres are

219
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,680
increasing yearon-year um nationally. So

220
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,599
um across most of the commodity groups

221
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,000
um down where I sit in Alabama, we're

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,519
actually um have a pretty uh we're

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,519
higher than the national average for

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,679
cover crop acres. And there are a number

225
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,000
of other uh researchers who are mostly

226
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,919
in the area of aronomy um but also

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,039
variety testing are working on um cover

228
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,719
cropping. So um in the CCBN each species

229
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,159
has some of its own breeding goals and

230
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,399
I'm not going to go into those in

231
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,278
detail. In general we're selecting for

232
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
high biomass and bigger high biomass the

233
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,879
amount of cover crop residue is the

234
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,919
chief thing that we can use to evaluate

235
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:25,278
how much of those benefits um the soil

236
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,079
may actually get. Um so the thing that I

237
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,919
want to add to this um at least today is

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
the need to select for performance in

239
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,079
mixtures. This is a simple pie chart

240
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,080
from cover crop survey that shows that

241
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,639
65% of farmers who cover crop plant

242
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
mixtures when they do. So usually that's

243
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,799
grass legume mixtures but sometimes

244
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,919
they're planting like up to 15 species

245
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:51,159
or huge numbers of of uh species

246
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,958
together. So we need to select in these

247
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,799
environments. Okay. Okay. So, finally,

248
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,719
an outline. Um, so I'm I'm going to um

249
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,399
talk to you first some conceptually

250
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,879
about breeding for intercropping, why to

251
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,639
do it, how to do it. Um, and then try to

252
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,320
talk to you about actual efforts that

253
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,919
I've been making um to do this. Um, so I

254
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
will spend most of my time talking about

255
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,240
a cover crop mixture project which is

256
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,958
focused on crimson clover and oat, but

257
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,278
I'm going to mention briefly uh a small

258
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,119
project I have with cassava and cowpie.

259
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,879
And then last but definitely not least,

260
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,039
a project I have with Sha Luke and

261
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,200
others who may be familiar to you that's

262
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:32,240
focused on grain intercropping with oats

263
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,000
and peas. All right. So um so most of

264
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,759
what I'll talk about come from came from

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,679
uh two papers we published in the last

266
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,360
couple of years. A perspective article I

267
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,159
wrote with John Luke Mikey Canar and

268
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Nick San Antonio. And also a review

269
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,719
paper that Jenny wrote um uh led um

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,600
about plant breeding for temperate

271
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
intercropping systems. So um

272
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,639
intercropping is anytime we're planting

273
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,600
two or more species and or cultivars in

274
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,159
the same place and or time. So that's my

275
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
very um it's a big umbrella term for a

276
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,000
very broad practice. There may be as

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,200
many intercropping practices as there

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,879
are people who plant intercrops. Um they

279
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,839
can be categorized different kinds of

280
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,600
ways. Um basically based on how the

281
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839
crops that we're planting are spatially

282
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
or temporally segregated. I'm not going

283
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,560
to give too many examples. Um, just to

284
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
say that my focus has been full

285
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,879
mixtures, meaning the pair of species

286
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,278
we're talking about are mixed in the

287
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,639
same hopper, planted in the same furrow,

288
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,919
they're growing in the same row, and

289
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,159
they're going to interact with each

290
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:37,039
other for better or worse for the whole

291
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:39,278
time. Um, so why intercrop? That could

292
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,039
be a whole talk. Um, and again, it

293
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,600
depends on the intercrop. I'm going to

294
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,838
be very reductive here um and give you

295
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
basically two kinds of reasons that

296
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,240
intercropping can be beneficial. The

297
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,639
first one is like we like to see overy

298
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,278
yielding meaning that if we plant a

299
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,559
mixture on an acre rather than the two

300
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:01,200
species in monoculture two halfacres say

301
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,639
we get a better result higher biomass

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,560
higher economic value of the intercrop.

303
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
That's of course the ideal that we're

304
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,559
going for, right? That's not what always

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,799
happens, but that's the reason to try to

306
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,518
do the practice. Um, and the other kind

307
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,399
of reason is something we often we refer

308
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,440
to a little more loosely,

309
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,839
multifunctionality. And I I'll just be

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,480
be simple about this and say it means

311
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,800
more species, more features, right? Um,

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,278
so for example, cereal rise, a grass,

313
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,799
can help with nitrogen retention, but

314
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,879
um, mainly it's going to produce a lot

315
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,078
of biomass, add a lot of potential

316
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,078
carbon to the soil. P is a legume. It's

317
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,239
going to fix nitrogen, add some N that

318
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,719
wasn't previously there. So, what we're

319
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,799
meaning here is if you have rye and P,

320
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,040
you can get some of the best of both of

321
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:50,559
those worlds, right? Okay. So, um,

322
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,919
there's a bunch of steps we might go

323
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,078
through to set up a a program to breed

324
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,399
for intercropping. This is a figure from

325
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,239
our review paper a couple years ago. I'm

326
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,519
going to like kind of simplify this down

327
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,440
rather than walk through it. Um, so

328
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
first of all, we need some enabling

329
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
factors. And I'm just going to kind of

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
say like the motivations and the funding

331
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,839
and the product profiles we need to

332
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,078
target are there already. Let's assume

333
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,040
that and think like geneticists and

334
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,638
breeders. Um so firstly we need to like

335
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,199
actually make sure there's genetic

336
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,079
variation for performance in

337
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,320
intercropping. If there isn't in our

338
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,000
germ plasm we're we're doing a

339
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
management. We need to be focused on

340
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,240
aronomy rights assuming there is then

341
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
we're going to have to ask where the

342
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,320
variation is actually expressed. In

343
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,879
other words genotype by management

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,360
interaction because if like it shows

345
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,120
here there's no interaction effect. So

346
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
varieties are not re-ranking at all

347
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,200
between environments. You can just keep

348
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,120
your breeding program as is, right?

349
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,879
Select for the better of whatever it is

350
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,320
and you'll get something that's better

351
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,519
for intercropping. Um but we're

352
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
typically going to find that

353
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,839
intercropping is a different environment

354
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,759
than um than monocrop. So if we have um

355
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,519
you know more simple like non-crossover

356
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,360
interactions um I I would say um we

357
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,799
don't have rank changes. you can do your

358
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,440
breeding for intercropping under

359
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,799
monoculture conditions. Um but um which

360
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
is what we're of course going to want to

361
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,159
do, right? Um plant breeding is hard

362
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,799
enough. We've already got our breeding

363
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,240
programs operational presumably. So when

364
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,120
we're usually selecting under

365
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,440
monoculture for monoulture so if we can

366
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
avoid adding brand new field trials or

367
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
instituting a new pipeline, that's what

368
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,839
I think most of us are going to want to

369
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
do. I do want to say like at this at

370
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
this point if we're going to keep

371
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,039
selection under monocropping we can

372
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,879
reach for indirect indirect selection

373
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,198
meaning sometimes call this the trait

374
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,879
informed approach try to identify

375
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,879
phenotypes that are expressible in

376
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,600
monocrop but predictive of performance

377
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,879
in intercrop and select for those but

378
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,399
I'm really going to focus today on the

379
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,320
situation I think is going to be very

380
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,159
common the best that we have crossover

381
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,639
interaction right the things that are

382
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,799
best for monoulture are not those that

383
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,399
are best for intercrop When that's the

384
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,319
case, you're going to have to institute

385
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
some co-evaluation. You're going to have

386
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,320
to breed for intercropping in the actual

387
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,399
environment where you are where you have

388
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,800
intercropping. So, um this is my very

389
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,879
simple um continuum of possible

390
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,759
co-esting strategies with the simplest

391
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,679
being what we'll call um a tester

392
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,159
scheme. Right? We have we're going to

393
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,719
keep the germ plasm primarily separate.

394
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:33,278
We're going to take all of species A and

395
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,120
evaluate them with a few exemplars of

396
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,360
species B. We're going to do the

397
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,039
reciprocal all of species B with a few

398
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,480
exemplars of species A. We'll call them

399
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,799
testers. The opposite end of that, we're

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,639
going to collide two entire germ plasms

401
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,159
as early as we can in a breeding

402
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,959
program. We're going to have some kind

403
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:54,078
of a novel breeding pipeline um that

404
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,799
does that. Um that's going to be a brand

405
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:00,239
new thing um and potentially a lot of

406
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,159
work. So we are not always going to do

407
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
that kind of joint evaluation but what I

408
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,240
want to talk about is how we can

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,000
actually do that with some of the modern

410
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,720
approaches that we use in plant

411
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,440
breeding. Um so I I actually don't have

412
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,519
to invent a lot uh to to get this um

413
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,519
started. Strategies to breed for

414
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,440
intercropping have been around. This is

415
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,360
I think the first paper that describes

416
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,120
it. It's 1985 by AG Wright. And um

417
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
already hopefully you can see that this

418
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,320
might resemble um like a hybrid breeding

419
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,319
program where you have two two heterotic

420
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
groups but instead we've got two

421
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,480
species. Obviously we're not crossing

422
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,919
species with each other but um what this

423
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
is meant to indicate is we're going to

424
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,759
have a field trial where we're assess

425
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:47,198
members of both species um co-planted.

426
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,600
Um we will then use those data to make

427
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,240
rankings uh breeding values and make

428
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,560
selections either in species A and or in

429
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
species B to generate new progynies and

430
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,958
then we're going to have to of course be

431
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,559
able to test them when intercropped.

432
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,599
This paper also described how we can

433
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,720
genetically evaluate an intercrop. Um so

434
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
there there are some different models

435
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
than what I'll show here but this is

436
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,919
this is basically uh we call it a

437
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
general and specific mixing ability

438
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,799
model has direct analogy to combining

439
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,038
ability model. Um we would use in hybrid

440
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,359
breeding. Um so here we're going to

441
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,558
evaluate a response variable is going to

442
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,198
be the total merit of the intercrop. The

443
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,639
combined yield from your plots. Um so

444
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,679
like for cover crops that's just going

445
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,000
to be the total biomass for example. for

446
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,798
um others it might be like an economic

447
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,679
merit index or whatever you might be

448
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,400
focused on. So basically in this model

449
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,559
we we have uh two main effects one for

450
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,320
each species. We like to call this a

451
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,160
general mixing ability that's the

452
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,119
average performance of a genotype and

453
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,759
mixture with any other genotype of the

454
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,599
alternatives of the companion species.

455
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,079
And we have a specific mixing ability

456
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,079
term, an interaction term. That's the

457
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,519
performance deviation of particular

458
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:04,759
combinations of the two species um of

459
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,839
cultivars of the two species. So we have

460
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,759
the statistical or the the genetic

461
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,759
models that we need. We have some idea

462
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,119
of what the breeding strategy might look

463
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,480
like. But the but the challenge to to do

464
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,199
this is we're talking about breeding in

465
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,200
genetics with more than one species. one

466
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,400
species is generally enough for most of

467
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,880
us. Um there's a huge number of possible

468
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,840
combinations and interactions genotype

469
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,919
by species by management by inter by

470
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,480
environment interaction. It's a lot to

471
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,360
navigate and parse. You just take the

472
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,000
genetics uh like the genetic component.

473
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,558
It's quite easy to imagine 200 lines

474
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,640
each per cohort for any given pair of

475
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,519
breeding programs. that would be 40,000

476
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,280
combinations which we're never going to

477
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,119
try to do a field experiment and

478
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,200
co-evaluate all those combos, right?

479
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,119
Certainly not replicated field trials or

480
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,160
anything like that. So, as you might

481
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,479
imagine, that limits what we can do um

482
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,798
in a conventional kind of phenotypes

483
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
only selection paradigm, right? We're

484
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,240
going to have to in that case evaluate

485
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,079
all or or at least most of the

486
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,558
combinations that we want to have a

487
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,558
ranking for. So we end up limited to the

488
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,519
late stages where we have low amount of

489
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,678
genetic variation. So as always we want

490
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,400
to reach for approaches that allow us to

491
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,679
evaluate intercrop performance or

492
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
whatever the trait is we're interested

493
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,400
in as early in a breeding pipeline as we

494
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:30,079
can so that we can enrich the downstream

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,559
results for higher performance. Um in

496
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,159
other words to increase selection

497
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,918
intensity and so we can reach for

498
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
basically two components that are are

499
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,200
fairly common these days. Firstly, we

500
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,120
can use a sparse design. Um, so we're

501
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,960
we're using these commonly to capture

502
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,119
genotype by environment interaction

503
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
without having to replicate all of your

504
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,759
genotypes multiple times in each

505
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,200
environment across every single

506
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,119
environment. For intercrops, that means

507
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,038
we're not going to have to evaluate all

508
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,279
of the combinations, at least if we're

509
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,359
only where we're mainly interested in

510
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,678
that main effect term, that is the

511
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,798
general mixing ability. So this is an

512
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,200
example um uh from a real um a small

513
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,918
study that had uh 28 P's and seven

514
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,038
barley. So 28 P's on the columns,

515
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,679
barley's on the rows. Um that would be

516
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,359
196 combinations. And in this article,

517
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,440
what they were able to show was you can

518
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,719
get good estimates of the general mixing

519
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,679
ability term. um with just by just

520
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,159
testing 64 combos with the critical

521
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,038
feature being that we have every P with

522
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,320
two barley, every barley with eight P in

523
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:40,158
this particular example. So the the

524
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,079
other component hopefully um uh that we

525
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,200
want we're going to want to reach for is

526
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,839
a genomic relationship matrix to connect

527
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,240
the data from multiple environments

528
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,480
which in this case means intercropped

529
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,599
partners. So we want to test as many

530
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,558
intercrop partners or environments as we

531
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:01,038
possibly can. So the idea here is to use

532
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,678
genomic relationships plus this sparse

533
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,679
design. Um briefly I'll I'll kind of

534
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,519
show you um the main figure from the

535
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,640
paper we wrote um a couple years ago

536
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,960
about this. Um and all I want to show is

537
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,720
um so we have this grid here. That's our

538
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
sparse design. We've got all of the

539
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,279
individuals of one species and all of

540
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,599
the individuals of another species. we

541
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,079
might want to evaluate. Um, but we're

542
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,480
only going to sparsely test them. So,

543
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,558
every member of each species gets tested

544
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,240
with several members of the alternative

545
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:34,079
species. Um, uh, so the field tiles

546
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,720
there, basically the ones we might

547
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,158
select for a field experiment. Then

548
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
three and four here, I'm just going to

549
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,840
go quickly over three and four here.

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,119
Just we're going to we're going to plant

551
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,319
out a field trial, collect the relevant

552
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,319
phenotypes, whatever they are. We're

553
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,839
going to genotype everything and at the

554
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,960
end we're going to be able to fit a

555
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:55,759
genomic enabled um model of general

556
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,000
mixing ability and this can allow us to

557
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,000
do two types of selection. The typical

558
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,480
two that we're interested in v variety

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,960
development and population improvement.

560
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,880
So first of all we can select all of the

561
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,640
best combinations and advance them into

562
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,679
some trial where we're actually test

563
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,919
those combinations. That would be um

564
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,159
selection for variety development. And

565
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,400
the other part is of course improving

566
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,039
the population. And this is probably a

567
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
bit um optimistic, but the idea is we're

568
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,319
going to run a breeding program, right?

569
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
And we're going to um mo through

570
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,839
multiple cohorts, make selections, make

571
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,480
crosses, and improve or co-improve the

572
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,119
the system as as a whole. So that was

573
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,599
the idea. Um I think the one other thing

574
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,678
I wanted to show is we also can simply

575
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,839
in directly incorporate genomic

576
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,120
relationships into this general mixing

577
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:48,158
ability model. Um so we can simply

578
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,279
include a genomic relationship matrix

579
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,159
for oats for the oat GMA for P for the

580
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,319
PGMA and a chronic product of the two

581
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,640
can help us to capture the interaction

582
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,480
term the specific mixing ability and

583
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
importantly that's going to mean that I

584
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,360
can make a prediction of uh even the

585
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,880
untested combinations and their

586
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,839
performance as well as the breeding

587
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,400
values of each species even those that

588
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,959
we haven't field tested um or that we

589
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,679
and field tested in combinations. Okay,

590
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,038
so that's the idea. Uh with what time I

591
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,600
have, I want to tell you about what

592
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,519
we're actually doing. Um so firstly, we

593
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,399
have a project that focuses on cover

594
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,158
crop mixtures. Um and we're are trying

595
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,120
to use both genomic and phenomic

596
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,280
selection to do this. Uh the focal

597
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,959
system I chose was crimson clover and

598
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,639
oat. Um this is sort of a listing of

599
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,640
cover crop species that are used in

600
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
mixture. So cereal rye is the most

601
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,200
common cereal that's used for cover

602
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,120
cropping and in mixtures, but um a lot

603
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
of folks where I sit are very interested

604
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,959
in grazable cover crops. Oats have a

605
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,519
little bit of a higher forage quality.

606
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,240
So we chose crimson clover and oat for

607
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,119
this project for that

608
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,359
reason. Um and so this is this is a

609
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:05,279
project that's funded by a USDA NIFA and

610
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:07,839
an um Auburn um intramural grant. Um my

611
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,519
collaborators um include Dr. Restabon

612
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,278
Rios who's a forge breeder at the

613
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,278
University of Florida. He has a crimson

614
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,679
clover breeding program. Actually met

615
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,919
him when he gave a seminar remotely when

616
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,159
he gave a seminar right here a couple

617
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,320
years ago. Um and we have some some

618
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,480
partners at Auburn physiologist Alvaro

619
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,639
Sesin Bao is now at the University of

620
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,440
Delaware. So our new phenomics expert

621
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,600
expert is Tenzel Remen. And uh I'm very

622
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,759
grateful to the Sunrains Cooperative.

623
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:37,119
Steve Harrison and Ali Barbar Bar Babar

624
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,440
are um uh small grains breeders in the

625
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:43,839
southeast and they have um basically

626
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,000
donated oat lines to the project. Um so

627
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,439
our major goal with this project is is

628
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
basically just to pilot the um the ideas

629
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
that I just shared right using a sparse

630
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,119
design and connectedness from genomic or

631
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,839
phenomic information to evaluate these

632
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,959
mixing ability terms as early as we can

633
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,240
in the breeding pipeline. So uh before I

634
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
show you how we're going to integrate

635
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,679
this into crimson clover breeding

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,839
program to tell you how we actually

637
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,600
breed crimson clovers. They're open

638
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,959
pollinated. So, um, this is one of the

639
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,558
things I've spent the last couple years

640
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,440
kind of wrapping my head around and

641
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,759
figuring out how to make progress. Um,

642
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,600
we start with evaluating single plants,

643
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,679
right? Space plant evaluation. We do it

644
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,519
in a pollen isolated way as much as we

645
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,840
can. We plant as far from any other

646
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,918
crimson clovers because whatever we let

647
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,720
f flower, the bees are going to decide

648
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,520
what the mating scheme is. Um, each of

649
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,640
our genetic units is basically its own

650
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,240
special individual. Um, and so we're

651
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,038
going to have to do some kind of culling

652
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,240
selection. I'd say 10 to 20% is much

653
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,319
more serious than I actually use. But,

654
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,720
um, so we're going to allow just the

655
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,278
best plants to pollinate. We're going to

656
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
collect seed from each individual plant

657
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:59,038
so we can track the maternal lineage at

658
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:00,439
least. Um, if not, um, but we're of

659
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,119
course not going to know the pollen

660
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,519
parents. Those maternal seedlines then

661
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,158
go obviously to the next year's space

662
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,119
plant nursery. It's an alogamus annual

663
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,320
we are cycling every single year. Um and

664
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,798
in addition we can get in the second

665
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:19,200
year our first opportunity to do biomass

666
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,119
yield kind of trials. We also call we

667
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,360
often call these sword plots. But

668
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,918
importantly each plot is going to have a

669
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,558
halfs entry. So each plant may have the

670
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,159
same maternal hletype but that's about

671
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,119
the that that's the main connection

672
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,799
between all between them.

673
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,359
The other thing that we do with the

674
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,440
seeds from uh each space plant nursery

675
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,599
is comprise a synthetic line or a

676
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,519
balanced bulk from the best say 50 to 65

677
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,399
individuals. Um we we make a single seed

678
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,158
lot from each nursery and we enter that

679
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,360
into the cover crop breeding network's

680
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,000
advanced line trial series. It's a

681
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:59,038
multi-lo like 15 sites up to per year.

682
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,480
Um and this is where we get our first

683
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:05,278
our first biomass yield and um like uh

684
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,200
cover crop performance metrics uh

685
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,200
compared against major commercial

686
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,919
checks. This is the test bed where we're

687
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,080
determine what might be valid to release

688
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,080
in the

689
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,678
future. Um okay so now I can tell you

690
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,319
how we're going to integrate genomic

691
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,798
selection into this or specifically

692
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,519
genomic selection for mixing ability

693
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,918
with oat. Um, so we have our initial

694
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,480
space plants. We call them, we get the

695
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,600
selected plants and their seed. It's at

696
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,319
this stage that we're going to do

697
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,240
genotyping of the halfsib families.

698
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,839
Those halfsib families are then going

699
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,558
to, of course, they're going to be used

700
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:43,199
to comprise next year's nursery to make

701
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,918
the next balanced bulk. And the thing

702
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,919
that I want to add to this is a yield

703
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,159
trial um, where we can evaluate

704
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,320
potentially both sets of genetic units.

705
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,399
I've called this a preliminary yielded

706
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,079
mixtures trial. Um, but as you can see

707
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,839
here, we have a bunch of single row

708
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,720
plots and each one of them has a

709
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,759
different crimson clover half with um, n

710
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,919
oat companion um, to compete with. Of

711
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,519
course, the idea is we can then use the

712
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
combination of the genotypes on the

713
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,440
halfsibs and the phenotypes that we

714
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,840
collect in the yield trial to make

715
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
genomic prediction and kind of intercept

716
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,119
the seed on the way to the uh next

717
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,119
year's space plant nursery to um try to

718
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,199
increase the intensity of selection and

719
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,759
incorporate the prediction for general

720
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,319
mixing ability at the least. So, the

721
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,879
trial is uh going to be four site years

722
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,599
total, two locations times two years.

723
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,919
We're actually just finishing up. I will

724
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,798
hopefully be harvesting my second and

725
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,840
final year of this main experiment um

726
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,359
next week in fact. Um so we have single

727
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,278
row plots. Last year they were just six

728
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,240
feet long. This year we've got 12 foot

729
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,558
long plots. Better seed yield last year.

730
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,839
Um other important features of the

731
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:56,639
experimental design. We have around 200

732
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,639
entries per year that we ran. 78 in the

733
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,159
first year, 200 this year, including the

734
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,200
advanced lines that are currently in

735
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:07,278
CCBN's ALT series. Um, we kept the oat

736
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,798
lines um consistent since they're inbred

737
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,440
lines. It's at least a little more

738
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,918
relaxing than having everything cycle

739
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,720
every single year. Um, so we kept the

740
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,520
the the 26 oats constant. Um, we ended

741
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,640
up with 1,200 plots total or 600 plots

742
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,798
per location year. Um, so just to give

743
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,640
you context instead of going into all

744
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,200
the details of how we set up the

745
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,320
partially replicated design, um, there

746
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,880
are 4,628 possible combos of the number

747
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,678
of germ plasm that we had last year and

748
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,720
instead we've sampled about 22% of that

749
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,960
space. So we had 1,020 combos as you

750
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,798
imagine with,200 plots and as I

751
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,278
explained with the sparse design, we're

752
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,879
mostly most of them are unreplicated.

753
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,798
Some of them are replicated so that we

754
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,760
can you know get better estimates of

755
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,240
interaction effects and those kind of

756
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,319
things.

757
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,159
Um I'll skip over this part. Um I also

758
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,839
wanted to mention another wrinkle. Um so

759
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,799
so this is our first attempt to actually

760
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,000
do genotyping for breeding in crimson

761
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,798
clover. I mentioned we don't have a

762
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,119
reference genome yet. Um we chose to go

763
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,278
with a with a what I call frequency

764
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,079
typing or pooling by families. This is

765
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:20,079
an approach that Dr. Rios has used in

766
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,918
alalfa and annual ryrass among others um

767
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,558
successfully. The idea is we're going to

768
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,679
take like uh uh equal parts of tissue

769
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:31,440
from 20 plants per family, pull it, sequ

770
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,120
um isolate the DNA. Um we used um low

771
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,000
pass sequencing from Hudson Alpha

772
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,839
Institute's Kufu platform um and ended

773
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,640
up aligning our reads to the uh red

774
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,879
clover's reference genome um for now. So

775
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,880
we ended up with 3,700 markers

776
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,799
approximately that we can use and the

777
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,600
idea here is we're sequencing to capture

778
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,079
al frequencies and co-frequencies

779
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,959
between the families um rather than

780
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,960
genotypes right um so this is not plant

781
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,798
level genotyping

782
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,038
um but we can construct a genomic

783
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,759
relationship matrix from this and use it

784
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,398
to make predictions also just to mention

785
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,798
that we are looking at a whole bunch of

786
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,278
different phenotypic parameters I'm just

787
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,038
going to talk briefly Today um we've

788
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,558
done a bunch of non-destructive uh

789
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,278
sampling mainly with multi and

790
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,480
hyperspectral UAVs something like s

791
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,440
seven time points per site per year um

792
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,599
have been flown and of course um cover

793
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,480
crop termination time we we take the

794
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,959
biomass we separate by species and get

795
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,200
the dry biomass per species. So that's

796
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,679
our primary yield component and the two

797
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,480
phenotypes that I'll talk about today.

798
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,880
Um while I have been dabbling in genomic

799
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,360
prediction using last year's data set,

800
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,760
my graduate student Gideon Obode, first

801
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,879
PhD student to join the lab, has been

802
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,798
working on the UAV data. Um so what he

803
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,039
has done is he taken se the seven time

804
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:57,119
points per location. He's taken um uh

805
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,759
both the spectral reflectances that come

806
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:03,119
directly from the drone also um

807
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:05,839
vegetation indices like NDPIs um and use

808
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,518
that to com um to make as the predictors

809
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,359
to make a phenomic relatedness matrix.

810
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,480
Um the intermediate step here is

811
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,639
basically spectrally um uh doing um

812
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,599
spatial correction of the the spectral

813
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,679
readings and to get um blues for each

814
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:25,519
crimson clover family basically. So I

815
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,840
end up with um a uh a single value for

816
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,839
each of these predictors for every

817
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,839
crimson clover family and we end up with

818
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,918
a relationship matrix that's number of

819
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:37,359
clover by number of clover matches the

820
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,080
genomic relatedness matrix. Um so this

821
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,558
is this is fairly preliminary work. But

822
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,278
without further ado, um the first thing

823
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,918
that I wanted to show is that we have

824
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,798
detectable genetic variation for both

825
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,720
crimson clover and oat mixing ability

826
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,879
from the first year of this field trial.

827
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,038
Two traits are all I'm going to share.

828
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,679
Total biomass and the proportion of that

829
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,359
biomass that's crimson clover. Um and

830
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,320
this is the proportion of variance

831
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,398
that's from genetic sources. um parsed

832
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,639
by the sources specifically. So there's

833
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,879
no specific mixing ability. Um our

834
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,559
trials definitely set up to target that

835
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,159
general mixing ability term. And um as

836
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,678
you can see, the bulk of the genetic

837
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,840
variance appears to come from the

838
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,919
clover. Um and most of that's really

839
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:25,119
captured by that phenomic relatedness

840
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,320
matrix. So not much directly from the

841
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,479
genomic relationship matrix. Um but this

842
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,158
is a good first step, right? we have

843
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,599
statistically significant genetic

844
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,519
variance to work with. Um, next thing I

845
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,678
did was to look at those predicted

846
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,440
breeding values. And so I kind of wanted

847
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,440
to figure out what's going on in the

848
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,919
germ plasm. Start to think about how we

849
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,558
would use this for selection. So here's

850
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,360
um all each dot is either a clover or an

851
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,000
oat excession uh with uh the x-axis

852
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:57,359
being proportion clover, y being the

853
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,038
total biomass. Um so basically we see a

854
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,959
significant trade-off a negative

855
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:04,000
relationship is makes perfect sense

856
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,278
really right um uh oats that produce a

857
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,159
lot more biomass end up uh corresponding

858
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,519
with um being less compatible with

859
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,599
crimson clovers basically um whereas uh

860
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:18,239
basically we need to be selecting for

861
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,399
bigger clovers so I think this is the

862
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,638
hypothesis we would have gone into grass

863
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,960
legume mixtures usually the grass is the

864
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
more competitive member so we probably

865
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,559
need to be breeding for more competitive

866
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,800
oat uh clovers and less competitive

867
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,679
oats, sacrificing some of the total

868
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,200
biomass along the way. Okay, so that's

869
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,720
that's one of the things we can look at.

870
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,319
And of course, we want to know, can we

871
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,358
make genomic predictions with this

872
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,440
quantity um with with these data? So,

873
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,119
I'm going to predict two things. The

874
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,519
mixture performance, which is going to

875
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,838
be mixture total genetic value. In other

876
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,519
words, the combination of the

877
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,440
predictions for both species and the

878
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,000
interaction. And I'm also of course

879
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,320
interested in the the u breeding value

880
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,838
prediction for the clover because I'm

881
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,838
running clover breeding program and

882
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,119
that's what I want to use to select what

883
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,960
goes to the next nursery. Um there are

884
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,838
different resampling procedures we could

885
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,519
do for cross validation. Uh for for

886
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,119
brevity I'm just going to talk about the

887
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,039
clover um uh clover uh I'm just going to

888
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,800
resample the clovers but you can also do

889
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,639
resampling with the oats. And the

890
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,119
hardest thing to do, of course, would be

891
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,279
to resample both species at the same

892
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,240
time. In other words, test the ability

893
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,880
to predict um combinations where you've

894
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,559
observed neither the clover nor the oat

895
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,720
before. Um but I'm just going to show

896
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:41,279
the clover resampling um for today. Um

897
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:43,039
so we we can do some prediction of um of

898
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,280
uh especially the mixture performance.

899
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,920
So shown here in the teal um would be

900
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,119
the prediction accuracy for the mixture

901
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,358
total genetic value. Um since we are

902
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,119
resampling the clovers here, the oats

903
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,679
are essentially their genomic

904
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,358
relationships are always in the model.

905
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,039
Um which means that a lot of this

906
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,400
prediction accuracy comes from there.

907
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,000
They're basically treated like

908
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,400
environments for the clovers. Um and

909
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,320
we've got very small or let's just say

910
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,320
modest prediction accuracy for the

911
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,200
clovers. This is our first attempt.

912
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,800
small marker set. Um, and I'll take it.

913
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:21,679
It's it's greater than zero. Um, so so

914
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,160
there you go. Um, and uh, as I

915
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:27,358
mentioned, we also have been using the

916
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,679
uh, the drone data to uh, try to capture

917
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,519
um, relationships between clovers as

918
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,679
well. And the cool thing is when you

919
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,320
include the phenomic relatedness matrix,

920
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,559
that's the teal here, we get much

921
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,760
improved ability to predict the clover

922
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,679
general mixing ability in particular. So

923
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,599
just to kind of conclude this little bit

924
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,358
here, I think I have more time. Um the

925
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,079
key things we we do have significant

926
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,400
gener um variation for clover and oat

927
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,119
performance in mixtures. Um there's that

928
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,838
oat biomass um productivity trade-off to

929
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,000
contend with. Um suggests we need to

930
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,960
select for less competitive oats, more

931
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,838
competitive clovers. My clover uh mixing

932
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,039
ability prediction is ability is small.

933
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:13,440
Um but phenomic prediction does very um

934
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,358
significantly improve that. I I do think

935
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,358
an open question I need to consider

936
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,480
carefully is how I should actually use

937
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,960
that and um be happy to hear thoughts

938
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,280
about that at the end. Um and there's

939
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,199
lots to do to to get better at at um

940
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,720
working with crimson clover and genomic

941
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,519
prediction of the species. We probably

942
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,679
need a bigger pop um population. We most

943
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,838
certainly need bigger plots. We can get

944
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,519
them from bigger seed yields. um we need

945
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,599
to develop the reference genome and get

946
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,440
an idea of actual population genetic

947
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,599
parameters like effective population

948
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,800
size etc.

949
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,200
Okay, so um that's it for clover and oat

950
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,039
mixing ability. I also wanted to spend a

951
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:55,199
few moments and tell you about cassava

952
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:57,519
and calpe. Um so trop in the tropics or

953
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,838
in the global south um this slide

954
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,920
doesn't specifically show that but um it

955
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,480
is a fact that intercropping and

956
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,720
polyulture production is much more

957
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,519
common than it currently is in temperate

958
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,199
systems. So it seems just very obvious

959
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,800
that we if we're going to breed for

960
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,399
intercropping one of the most important

961
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,280
places it's going to be done it would be

962
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,440
in tropical systems and as you guys know

963
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,760
worked with cassava for a lot of years

964
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,200
and my graduate student Gideon actually

965
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,440
worked with a cowp breeding unit I ITA

966
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,919
after he worked firstly for the cassava

967
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,440
breeding unit. So um when we got to

968
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,000
talking about what he would do for his

969
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,920
PhD, it was like obvious we should try

970
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
to see if somebody in our cassava

971
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,119
network wanted to plan an intercropping

972
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,280
trial with cassava and kalpy. Um so

973
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,039
Gideon set up this trial and pitched it

974
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
or recollectively pitched it to Dr.

975
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,358
Ismile Robbie who's now the head of

976
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,960
cassava breeding at IITA. And I've just

977
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,880
been super thrilled that I gotten to

978
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,358
keep collaborating with him even if it's

979
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,160
just on this small pilot project. He's

980
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,319
basically run it for me, Gratus so far.

981
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,399
Um, and I get to share with you the very

982
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,200
first year out of two um that we're

983
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
going to get to run um of this

984
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:08,319
experiment. So, this is the the

985
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,440
experimental design. Um, we basically we

986
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,320
have 120 cassava clones that we chose uh

987
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,200
from their existing pipeline PYT and AYT

988
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,039
stage. Um, Gideon chose two cowpies, one

989
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,559
that's an upright type and one that's a

990
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,800
spreading type. Don't ask me too many

991
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,960
questions about cowpies. Not an expert

992
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,200
there. We observed them in both mixture

993
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
and in monoulture unlike the previous

994
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,439
experiment that I just described where

995
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,599
we only focused on mixtures. Um and

996
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,440
there were two replicates with a two row

997
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,680
design like this. So the cassava and the

998
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,400
cowpie are planted in the same row

999
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,078
directly with each other. Um the other

1000
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,000
thing to know is that they are planted

1001
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,079
together but not harvested together.

1002
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,079
It's almost more like a relay I would

1003
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,640
say because cowpas are short season.

1004
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,519
Three months to four months maximum

1005
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,400
before harvest. Cassava takes 10 to 12

1006
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,000
months before harvest. So something like

1007
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,920
nine months the cassava are actually

1008
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,320
alone in the field after the cowpiece

1009
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,320
come up. I was honestly betting against

1010
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,480
there being any impact on the cassava at

1011
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,359
all. But that's actually not what we

1012
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,679
found. Um so indeed uh when you

1013
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,960
intercrop cassava regardless of the type

1014
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:18,000
of cowp that we try um cassava root

1015
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,800
yields and by by various metrics are

1016
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,480
somewhat um decreased. And the same is

1017
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,320
is true for the cowpie. When they're

1018
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,400
intercropped, they have lower yield than

1019
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,800
when they're monocropped. Okay? So

1020
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,760
that's uh not the same thing as saying

1021
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,920
that the intercrop itself is not as

1022
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,320
valuable. In fact, the the one result I

1023
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,800
want to share is this. This is a ranking

1024
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,760
of the cassava clones or 120 cassava

1025
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,079
clones relative to a parameter called

1026
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,160
the land equivalent ratio. This is

1027
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,240
simply the uh ratio of the yield

1028
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,480
observed in inter incrop to the yield

1029
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,199
observed in monocrop. And so in the

1030
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,519
green we have leer cassava greater than

1031
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,919
one meaning these guys are actually

1032
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,559
yielding better when we intercrop them

1033
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,240
than when we monocrop them. And I'm I'm

1034
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,639
not showing like the details of the mix

1035
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,879
models we fit but we can also show that

1036
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,279
there's a significant genotype by

1037
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,760
management interaction here. Both of

1038
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,760
those collectively say that we have some

1039
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,880
motivation to breed cassava or at least

1040
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,359
to evaluate cassava under intercrop um

1041
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,960
um conditions and we need to do that if

1042
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,199
we want to figure out which cassava

1043
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,119
would be the right for intercrop um

1044
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,039
would be the best for intercropping

1045
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,358
systems. So I hope we can use this pilot

1046
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,719
project to sort of launch additional

1047
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:34,639
work in this and and other kinds of

1048
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:36,399
systems. All right. So, last but not

1049
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,039
certainly not least, but definitely the

1050
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,240
most early stage, I have this really

1051
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,639
cool project with Jeanluke and others um

1052
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:48,078
that's focused on a a temperate grain

1053
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:50,639
intercropping um system. So, this is a a

1054
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,720
project with oats and peas. Uh thank you

1055
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:56,639
to Peter Hyde and Leah Trefer for this

1056
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:59,118
slide. Um um so the the main thing that

1057
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,838
I want to say is um so we we plant the

1058
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,000
um these are again full mixtures of oats

1059
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:06,239
and peas that we plant. The the key

1060
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,480
feature here is if we get maturity

1061
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,639
correct and we can successfully combine

1062
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,400
them together. Oats and peas have pretty

1063
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:16,559
different seed size and shapes. So they

1064
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,160
can be separated after harvest. Um, so

1065
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:19,838
basically all I'm going to say today is

1066
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,639
that we have kind of a breeding for

1067
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,799
intercropping dream team assembled. Um,

1068
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,400
that includes again John Luke, Peter

1069
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,440
Hyde, and Leia Trefer from here at

1070
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,599
Cornell. Um, and we have both an oat and

1071
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,760
a pea breeder on the project um,

1072
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,559
deriving um, lines directly from their

1073
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,280
breeding programs. So Waveid Arballayas

1074
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,119
may be a familiar name around here and

1075
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
he is our oatreeder has at the

1076
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,920
University of Illinois or Bana

1077
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,000
Champlain. Um, Nono Bendo started off as

1078
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,720
our pereeder. He's now at North Carolina

1079
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,639
State. Sorry if I got that wrong. Um, so

1080
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,039
Marisol Bertie who's an expert in

1081
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,519
intercropping at North Dakota State is

1082
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,400
managing the pebbreeding program there.

1083
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,880
Um, and we have a partner at um,

1084
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,079
Corteva, both Sarah LRA and Frank Techno

1085
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,559
and postto Annabelle Don. Um, so these

1086
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,440
folks are each one of us is planting a

1087
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,920
single location of this field trial. Um,

1088
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,318
I actually planted mine in February. Um,

1089
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
I assume that will happen sometime soon

1090
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,920
in New York. Um, I'm not going to like

1091
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,838
go over all the different objectives.

1092
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,079
They're basically or in some ways the

1093
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,000
same as what we were doing with crimson

1094
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,680
clover and oat. That is we want to pilot

1095
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,480
genomic prediction of intercropping

1096
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,159
ability. We have this huge latitudinal

1097
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,079
range like we're really spanning a lot

1098
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:38,559
of environments here. Um we have a uh

1099
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,880
USDA NIFA um plant breeding for egg

1100
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,440
production um coordinated innovation

1101
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,559
network. It's a really um mouthful kind

1102
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,960
of um grant name, but this will allow us

1103
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,199
to do uh two years of a primary field

1104
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,639
trial series and sort of a supplementary

1105
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,159
third one as well. We're going till

1106
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:58,159
2028. Um and again we're we're deriving

1107
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,799
our germ plasm for OT and P directly

1108
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,598
from middle stage of the breeding

1109
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,960
pipelines. All told, across the couple

1110
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,838
of years of the project, we're going to

1111
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,639
have 480 oats and 440p peas or somewhere

1112
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:13,279
in that ballpark. Um, but each of us is

1113
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:16,078
going to plant 400 plots. 10 location

1114
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,400
years will end up being uh run total.

1115
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,280
Um, so that means we'll have four 4,000

1116
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,358
total inner crop plots, which would mean

1117
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,240
with with this number of oats and peas

1118
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:29,440
anyways, that's 211,000 combinations.

1119
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,279
So, as opposed to the 22% of the space

1120
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,039
that I searched with crimson clover and

1121
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,400
oat, we're actually searching less than

1122
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,079
2% um in this situation. And so, I'm

1123
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,240
really excited about this project. You

1124
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,280
can see um we're just reaching about

1125
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,639
elbow high um I guess um in in my field

1126
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,599
site. Things are growing fast. I

1127
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:50,960
actually saw some flowering peas um just

1128
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,960
last week. Um and so stay tuned for more

1129
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,159
on on this project. Um and that's that's

1130
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,920
where I'll finish. breeding for

1131
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,480
intercropping is definitely a major

1132
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,800
combinatorial challenge and I'm hoping

1133
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,480
that um the normal things I like to

1134
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,200
throw at problems genomic prediction

1135
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,639
sparse testing will help us do early

1136
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,480
stage evaluation for these quantities.

1137
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,318
So we need empirical examples and that's

1138
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,358
that's really what I'm up to these days.

1139
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:17,440
And um with that, thank you guys so

1140
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:21,838
much. Um it's been an honor. Can't wait

1141
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,240
to hear your questions. All right,

1142
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:27,358
morning. Yeah, beautiful talk. I was

1143
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:31,399
wondering uh about you you have this GMA

1144
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:33,838
estimate that's you know between two uh

1145
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,599
species. How correlated do you think

1146
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:40,480
that would be to essentially intrapecies

1147
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,318
competition?

1148
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,639
How correlated the general mixing

1149
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,119
ability to DMA? Yeah, I mean I'm sure

1150
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:50,838
you don't have the answer yet what that

1151
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:54,720
is, but what I mean is competitiveness

1152
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:57,519
within two individuals within a species

1153
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,439
is it kind of the same process as that

1154
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:04,079
GMA

1155
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,679
uh process? this the the SMA I totally

1156
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,519
expect to be very different but I was

1157
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,719
kind of wondering do you think you know

1158
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:12,960
that's going to be turn out to be 50%

1159
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:14,879
correlated that if you so the um this is

1160
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,960
often called the associate effect or the

1161
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,519
indirect effect of one species on

1162
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,519
another um I just for time I couldn't

1163
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,079
there's a whole another like evaluation

1164
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,239
model where we will separately analyze

1165
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,880
the separated yields like just the

1166
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:31,118
clover biomass and just the oat biomass

1167
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,720
and when you fit that same model with

1168
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,400
the main effect and the interaction term

1169
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:38,959
the the main effect for the alternate

1170
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,800
like if I'm analyzing clover biomass

1171
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,280
then the main effect for the oat in that

1172
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,000
model is uh telling me about the oat

1173
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,160
impact on the clover so it's it's uh and

1174
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,838
then that can be actually added to the

1175
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,920
GMA for clover to give me u sorry adding

1176
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,639
to the producer effect for clover this

1177
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,920
is a little hard without showing the

1178
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,480
model but um that's directly actually a

1179
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,400
measure of the competitive effect versus

1180
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,358
the sort of so a producer effect would

1181
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,680
be the species own effect on its own

1182
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,480
yield and the associate effect is the

1183
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,799
species effect on the other um the other

1184
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,000
species. So we can basically break that

1185
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,480
GMA down into those components um and

1186
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,239
then think about what to do for uh do

1187
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,199
with that for for breeding purposes. Um

1188
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,799
and actually I can say um from a little

1189
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,118
bit of preliminary results that uh

1190
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,680
Jeanluke has shared from some his work

1191
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,200
with oats and peas there is a negative

1192
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,719
genetic course fair to say there's a

1193
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,078
negative genetic correlation to some

1194
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,799
extent between the producer and

1195
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,880
associate effect. So yeah um more

1196
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,920
competitive something yeah there's a

1197
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,440
there's a sacrifice

1198
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,480
there also just want to say awesome

1199
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,280
talk. So in in thinking about like G bye

1200
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,960
of oat planted by

1201
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,920
itself, are you seeing anything where G

1202
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:01,599
bye would be higher or lower when it's

1203
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,440
planted with with P?

1204
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,359
I have just papered over that so far. Um

1205
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,838
so you're asking if if there's actually

1206
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:13,440
less G bye when we have an intercrop

1207
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,759
versus a monocrop. And um we do have

1208
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,960
some ability to try to estimate those

1209
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,160
components. I I have not done it yet.

1210
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,960
Um, so what was your question? Whether

1211
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,558
it's a higher or lower, but if you

1212
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,119
haven't, then that's like totally fine.

1213
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,040
But what would you expect? I guess then

1214
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,358
I'll I'll pose it that way. I know what

1215
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,358
I would like.

1216
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,759
That is fine, too. I already know from

1217
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,440
betting against cassava being affected

1218
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:47,760
by CalP in her crop that um what I would

1219
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:52,159
expect might be wrong. So,

1220
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,880
we have one um one question online. Uh

1221
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:58,719
does climate affect uh pollinators? Does

1222
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,960
drought um heat affect yield? How is

1223
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,598
this factored into the way you're sort

1224
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,960
of setting up your program? I would say

1225
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,720
those things are I

1226
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,960
mean relative to the intercropping

1227
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:13,838
projects, we have multilocation trials.

1228
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,639
So we're essentially trying to also

1229
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:19,279
estimate the G bye term. I'll take that

1230
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:22,078
as a question about like the impact of

1231
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,640
environmental variance and and I have

1232
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,440
been trying to focus just on like the

1233
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:29,400
genetic component mostly like main

1234
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,000
effects rather than those interaction

1235
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,440
terms. Not sure how

1236
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,760
else there was also a followup. What

1237
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,200
were the pollinators for clover? So I

1238
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,200
think it was it was geared a little bit

1239
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:44,879
more towards Okay. pollinators and

1240
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:47,598
impacts of of climate on on pollinators.

1241
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,119
Um, so so bumblebees and all kinds of

1242
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,280
other bees are love clovers. I'm no

1243
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,838
expert on like all the specific species

1244
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,359
of of their pollinators. Uh, one of my

1245
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,039
master students actually is is

1246
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,799
interested in that topic and so we'll

1247
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,880
see what what she can actually like

1248
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,559
produce, but I don't have too much

1249
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,599
knowledge about that. Uh, regarding the

1250
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,680
environmental effect, one thing that I I

1251
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,359
do think that we'll see when we can dig

1252
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:16,960
into like especially soil um fertility,

1253
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:19,679
um there is a a when you have a like a

1254
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,000
higher nitrogen environment that really

1255
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:26,639
benefits the grass and causes the grass

1256
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,719
or the cereal to out compete um or to be

1257
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,799
more competitive against the clover.

1258
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:34,480
Clover can fix its own nitrogen. So when

1259
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,318
you have a lower end environment the um

1260
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
and I think that's going to be a major

1261
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,838
confounding like in terms of spatial

1262
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,838
variability I observe myself like from

1263
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:47,279
in the first year from one end of the

1264
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:49,920
field to the next we went from uh more

1265
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,599
oat less clover to more clover less oat

1266
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,760
and I can't tell you why because I don't

1267
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,000
know but those are definitely

1268
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,280
confounding factors that we have to kind

1269
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,199
of address um just by spatial

1270
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,599
corrections however I've handled it so

1271
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:06,318
far.

1272
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,800
So, I think you highlighted some clear

1273
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:11,679
pros that conventional growers would

1274
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,720
would want to have intercrops. Um,

1275
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,279
organic producers have the same thing.

1276
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,959
In fact, they have fewer tools to to

1277
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,040
deploy to control and have these

1278
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,800
benefits. So, are you giving any

1279
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,199
additional consideration in your program

1280
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,200
to organic producers and what they're

1281
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:31,199
looking for in the system?

1282
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:34,159
Um, I I'm I'm very like I I would say

1283
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,078
like especially breeding cover crops,

1284
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,399
organic producers are going to be some

1285
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,760
of my best customers or my my best

1286
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,079
customers. Um, actually so far um I I

1287
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,559
work on a conventional farm. We don't

1288
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,240
have an organic farm that I can yet do

1289
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,800
plant breeding and genetics kind of work

1290
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:55,598
on um yet. Um we definitely contend with

1291
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,920
the issue like planting intercrops like

1292
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,960
of oats and peas for example immediately

1293
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,200
excludes the vast majority of any like

1294
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,679
chem chem chemistries that we can use.

1295
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,919
So there's no postplanting herbicides

1296
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,000
for example by definition. I I don't

1297
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,440
know if that's exactly an answer to your

1298
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,760
question but um we have the same

1299
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,679
challenges um um in that regard. Um

1300
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,800
actually I have a very basic question.

1301
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:24,558
Uh so when you're deciding a crop or

1302
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,000
you're thinking about a crop to be a

1303
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,240
cover crop, what are the key

1304
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,280
characteristics that it has should have

1305
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:33,199
the crop?

1306
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,000
Um probably a lot of people in this room

1307
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,639
could answer that better than me. Um

1308
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,480
well, so we're typically not always, but

1309
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,279
most of the species we're thinking about

1310
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,480
are cool season species because we're

1311
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,280
most of the commodity production is warm

1312
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,559
season, right? So it needs to be winter

1313
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,079
s hardy, right? And it also needs to be

1314
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:59,519
um able to deal with um like we nobody

1315
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:02,000
puts fertilizer or adds u you know uses

1316
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,400
herbicides or anything to control things

1317
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,400
in a cover crop field. The whole idea is

1318
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,480
you know farmers are busy. They're going

1319
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,720
to harvest as soon as they can and then

1320
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,480
they you know cover to plant a cover

1321
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,118
crop they have to do extra work. have to

1322
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,039
spend extra money, buy the seed, um

1323
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,440
plant the seed, spend the diesel, all

1324
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:23,519
that kind of stuff. Um so they the main

1325
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,480
thing that the cover crop has to be able

1326
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,119
to do is survive on its own in a low

1327
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,559
fertility or low kind of care and it has

1328
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,480
to compete against weeds. Um, so, uh,

1329
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,000
the main three traits we really are

1330
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,800
breeding for in the cover crop breeding

1331
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,960
network are biomass of course, but then

1332
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,359
early vigor, which basically just means

1333
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,519
getting big as quickly as possible, um,

1334
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,960
so that we have some weed suppressive or

1335
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:51,280
eros erosion control kind of benefits

1336
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,838
um, in the in the early part of the cool

1337
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:58,599
season and then has to survive over the

1338
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,599
winter. Um, yeah.

1339
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,000
