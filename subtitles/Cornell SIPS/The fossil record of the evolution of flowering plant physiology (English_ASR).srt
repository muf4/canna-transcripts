this is a production of Cornell

University

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,980
hi it's been great being here so far is

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,299
a lot of fun being in a plant biology

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,028
department I've been in earth science

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,320
departments my whole career and it's

7
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:20,410
been very nice talking to people many

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,820
actual botanists but even though there's

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,129
a lot of plant biology in this room I

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,528
think it's important to explain why I'm

11
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:28,149
a plant biologist and what I think of my

12
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:30,429
plants because it very well may be

13
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,710
different from the way a lot a lot of

14
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:35,289
people think about plants for me the the

15
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,600
real draw for plants primarily is the

16
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:38,948
fact that they have cell walls and a lot

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,750
awful lot falls out of that as far as

18
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:42,099
what you can do with them as fossils

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,920
this is a fossil that's 300 million

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,350
years old the snails are just shells the

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,920
plant in between is a plant we have all

22
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,439
this anatomy it's all there and given

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,359
that plants are largely visible

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,128
creatures involved in conducting water

25
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,510
and so on we can actually say a lot

26
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:01,178
about how this thing function based upon

27
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:02,738
having that that's a anatomy present the

28
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:04,210
original cell walls are preserves that

29
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:04,989
biochemistry is there so we can talk

30
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,669
about the evolution different

31
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,640
biochemical cell wall compounds and so

32
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,790
on and also kind of perhaps less

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,810
immediately but also very importantly

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,150
because the F cell walls is no cell

35
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,560
migration so their development is much

36
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,030
simpler than what you'd expect to see in

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,010
an animal with gastrulation and so on

38
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,480
and look at the final adult morphology

39
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,550
and say something about how it got there

40
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,579
in a much more direct way then then you

41
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:29,500
could with an animal and so on on top of

42
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:31,060
that plants are all trying to make their

43
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,859
living the same way and nearly all

44
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,439
aspects of land plant form has evolved

45
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,180
multiple times convergently based upon

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,530
that so we have lots of independent

47
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,000
experiments looking at the evolution of

48
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,650
different structures so if we look at

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,629
this phylogeny of living vascular plants

50
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,240
here blue needs to make it back to

51
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:47,379
Devonian and so on it looks like if you

52
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,159
know what these guys are that it looks

53
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,869
like there's a lot of morphological

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,489
continuity there as far as roots and

55
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,900
leaves and so on but the common

56
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:55,719
ancestors of these lineages are very

57
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,070
small and simple and most of what it

58
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,450
looks like these things might share has

59
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:59,829
actually evolved independently and

60
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,630
that's something we can directly assess

61
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,480
from the foster record where all these

62
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:05,799
guys have leaves they look kind of funny

63
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,030
but we look at slightly older members of

64
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,109
those lineages and they were going to

65
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,360
see nothing but these things slightly

66
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,500
older there won't be leaves at all so we

67
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,610
can actually trace the evolution of

68
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,789
these things and compare multiple

69
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,700
evolutions have very similar structures

70
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:20,389
and finally something that it's taken me

71
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:23,089
many years to really fully appreciate

72
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:26,000
that animals are cute right or they're

73
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,830
scary whatever but plants through the

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,469
carbon cycle they're all the biomass

75
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,819
they are the hydrologic cycle and all

76
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:34,669
the water in the atmosphere pleasure

77
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,289
climate and so the evolution of these

78
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:38,030
guys and the evolution their physiology

79
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,489
really is the evolution of the Earth's

80
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,229
surface in a very direct way and there's

81
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,270
been a whole lot of turnover through

82
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:46,459
time in what those plants are like and

83
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,689
that turnover matters right there's a

84
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,759
lot of focus on this kind of turnover

85
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:52,159
down there with the animals but they're

86
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,959
really kind of passive recipients of a

87
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,319
world that these guys are making for

88
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,120
them now my heart of hearts lies down

89
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,370
here and the Paleozoic and all the crazy

90
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,989
beasts that are down there today I'm

91
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,939
gonna focus on on these guys the

92
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,009
flowering plants now I am NOT an

93
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:08,810
angiosperm person they scare me

94
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:12,099
there are far far far too many of them

95
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,140
I'm not an angiosperm person but I think

96
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,090
that has some utility to looking from

97
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,859
the outside in towards the angiosperms

98
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,879
it can give you some perspective on what

99
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,380
it is that they're doing differently

100
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,039
that it's harder to see from the inside

101
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,819
and then hopefully if I have enough time

102
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,590
understanding what's going on here also

103
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:32,599
reflects back on what's going on back

104
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:34,400
there okay so my primary kind of entry

105
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,229
into the fossil record has always been

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,969
leaves initially I was interested in

107
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,199
leaf development and how we can use the

108
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,659
nation patterns to say something about

109
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,280
where growth is occurring within these

110
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,949
leaf structures how laminate surface of

111
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,590
all multiple times and so on I was doing

112
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:51,109
that from in my thesis and so on since

113
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,479
then and we can use venetian patterns to

114
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,430
say something about sequential

115
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,539
appearances of morphology indicating

116
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,370
sequential appearances of different

117
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:01,370
developmental modes showing up in

118
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,409
multiple independent lineages here over

119
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,879
time I got more interested in the fact

120
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,039
that these things are not just passive

121
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,269
records of development they also matter

122
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,578
for how this thing is functioning

123
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,840
physiologically they're conducting the

124
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,820
water and water matters if you're a

125
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,879
plant so I got more interest in the

126
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,430
physiology and as I did I was amused by

127
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,538
this a basic little lie in the way I've

128
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,439
always presented this all right this

129
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:23,360
might as well been from my thesis

130
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,389
depends here I'm indicating about how

131
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,610
ferns me very closely converged upon the

132
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,899
nation patterns seen in angiosperms but

133
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,310
there's a lie and the way I presented

134
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,819
that which is that they're not presented

135
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,740
at the same

136
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:36,110
scale if they were they would look like

137
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,930
that there's a lot more veins in the

138
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,879
flight line and this actually is going

139
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,269
to end up mattering quite a bit for how

140
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,430
these things can function so if you're a

141
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,539
plant you're trying to do photosynthesis

142
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,189
you're trying to take in carbon dioxide

143
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,129
from the atmosphere and you cannot help

144
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,839
but lose water in that process so in

145
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,490
order to keep on taking in carbon

146
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,839
dioxide through your stomata you need to

147
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,759
be able to replace the water you're

148
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,929
losing and if you cannot maintain that

149
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,250
steady state you have to close the

150
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,560
stomata and you have to stop water

151
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,839
synthesis so the ability to move water

152
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,250
very much matters for photosynthesis and

153
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,529
hydraulic capacity is can be very

154
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,399
strongly correlated with photosynthetic

155
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:15,409
capacity and hydraulic capacity of the

156
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,659
whole plant is very much tied up with

157
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,220
belief if we look at the resistance of

158
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,870
the entire pathway of water through the

159
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,790
plant at least half of it sometimes

160
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,470
two-thirds or more is tied up in the

161
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,330
last little bit that is represented by

162
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,550
the leaf you go up through the roots up

163
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:30,439
to Stan out the branch to the leaf that

164
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,910
was last little bit and even within

165
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,259
those centimetres the last couple

166
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,210
centimeters the reason there's so much

167
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,560
resistance in the leaf is actually tied

168
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,779
to the last couple microns right the

169
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,670
last millimeter or so which is the fact

170
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,649
that throughout that hydraulic pathway

171
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,360
water is moving through pipes designed

172
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,679
for water transport and it's when they

173
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,819
leave those pipes this is a cross

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,610
section of a leaf here when you leave

175
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:51,050
the the vasculature here to make it to

176
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,730
the stomata you're you're moving through

177
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,530
tissue that is not designed for a

178
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,420
hydraulic transport and much of the

179
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,319
resistance as a result is tied up in

180
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,060
that pathway through the mesophyll so

181
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,740
the hydraulic inductance of the entire

182
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,449
plant is very much tied to belief and

183
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,150
within the leaf it's really tied to this

184
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,589
path length from vane - stomata so

185
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:11,779
anything you can do to change that path

186
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:14,060
length is going to affect the hydraulic

187
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,559
capacity of the entire plant and the

188
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,800
easiest way to change that path length

189
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,449
is just to change the vane density if

190
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,220
you have more vanes those little blue

191
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,750
lines are going to be shorter the

192
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,180
maximum distance water has to travel

193
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,639
from the vein to the stomata is going to

194
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,860
be shorter and to demonstrate that this

195
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,209
really doesn't matter here this is

196
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,189
looking at the distance from vane to

197
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:35,810
stomata and the shorter of that distance

198
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,339
is the higher the leaf conductance to

199
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,990
water and the higher the leaf

200
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,949
conductance the higher the foods that a

201
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,350
great

202
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:45,769
you can do so this is all very much tied

203
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,990
to these vein characteristics so this is

204
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,909
looking at distance from vein two

205
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,189
stomata if you flip that around you get

206
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,110
vein density which is much easier term

207
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:55,490
to work with and that's just looking at

208
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,770
the millimeters of vein per square

209
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,210
millimeter of leaf surface there and so

210
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,039
if you look at that here this is vein

211
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:02,329
density versus maximum transpiration

212
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,510
rate and yes there's a very good

213
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:06,979
relationship here and now the fun thing

214
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,680
is that this is something that is

215
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,110
readily measurable in fossils we can

216
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,910
work with this trait and that becomes

217
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,160
very very important all right so here's

218
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,620
a living cycad living cycads are very

219
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,720
slow they grow very slowly but you would

220
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,980
never impune a Triassic cycad and say

221
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,050
that well they have to be growing slowly

222
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,400
like the living cycads for all we know

223
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,960
these guys have been displaced by the

224
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,819
spread of angiosperms maybe they were

225
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,009
more ecologically diverse in the distant

226
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:34,189
past before these transitions occurred

227
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,629
but no I can look at a variety of fossil

228
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,139
cycads they all look like the living

229
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,759
cycads

230
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,219
they're going to be stuck way down on

231
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,139
this spectrum here so we can it becomes

232
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,700
a very powerful tool for looking at the

233
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:48,079
physiology of fossil plants and

234
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,899
physiology through time and we looked at

235
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,039
a whole bunch of different plants and

236
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,229
first off don't worry about the colors

237
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,340
that had to do with a specific argument

238
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,319
about leaf development and how that

239
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,229
might be tied or not tied to two

240
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,579
potential vein densities the pattern to

241
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,250
look at here is the fact that these guys

242
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:06,050
down here which are the flowering plants

243
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,430
go way farther out on this axis than

244
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,259
anything else that has ever lived and

245
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,090
this includes a lot of exclusively

246
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:14,420
extinct lineages of seed plants and so

247
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,649
on as well as ferns up here as well now

248
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,449
perhaps the best way to look at this is

249
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:19,579
this graph here which is is being

250
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,079
density through time bein nestle is

251
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:23,930
incredibly stable in all non flowering

252
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,759
plants there's around to it you can go

253
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,680
down to about one millimeter of vein per

254
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,310
square millimeter of leaf surface it can

255
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,330
go up to around 5 but that's about it

256
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,460
until you get the evolution of flowering

257
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,009
plants where the average is about 8 to

258
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,200
10 and it can go up to 25 the lower

259
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:40,849
bound is still the lower bound but but

260
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,169
the mean and the maximum is about 4

261
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,640
times larger than any other group of

262
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:47,110
plants that has ever lived

263
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:52,689
and you can see what some of these guys

264
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:55,269
look like in practice here so this is a

265
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,760
fairly typical flowering plant that's a

266
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,319
fairly typical fern you can't even see

267
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,450
the smallest veins here whereas you're

268
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,250
seeing everything in that fern I had to

269
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,629
add this thing I gave a talk once and

270
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,269
there was a microbiologist who even

271
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,740
worked with leaves but yet and you've

272
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,179
seen these pictures of ferns that I was

273
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,500
putting up and he assumed that there was

274
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,969
more orders of veins that he couldn't

275
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,110
see they were there and that I was just

276
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,220
showing the bigger veins in them those

277
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,789
are all the veins there's nothing else

278
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,680
there and that really does is gonna end

279
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:22,599
up mattering physiologically I would

280
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,620
like to pause though and say that the

281
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,540
veins are not magic

282
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,919
right this is not a magic leaf if I took

283
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,569
one of these and stapled it to a psychic

284
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,689
you would not get a magic fast-growing

285
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,370
cycad you would get a dead leaf and this

286
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,230
is what this is doing is integrating a

287
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,879
lot of the biology the whole biology of

288
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,039
the organism it's just in a way that we

289
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,110
can actually been measuring fossils to

290
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,719
get an illustration of that kind of

291
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,879
integration I'm gonna do a bit of a

292
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,800
tangent that will actually come back and

293
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,509
be important later on where there's a

294
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,338
paper that I was not involved in I'm the

295
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,809
senior author here is a mushroom see in

296
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,029
this ski who's a close colleague of mine

297
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,429
and what they did is they made

298
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:59,139
artificial leaves out of gel and they

299
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,539
carved little channels in them ran a

300
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:03,939
tube to balance and they blew air over

301
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:07,389
the surface and evaporated water from

302
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,800
the surface as an artificial leaf and

303
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:11,039
what they were able to demonstrate is

304
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,899
that as you add more channels more veins

305
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,389
the amount of water you lose increases

306
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,909
but then it rapidly saturates and that's

307
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:22,269
that's where that saturation occurs is

308
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:24,730
going to reflect the thickness and what

309
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,929
they found was is that optimal placement

310
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,909
of these veins if you're trying to lose

311
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:30,338
water is when the distance between the

312
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:33,189
veins is the same as the distance from

313
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,720
that vein to the evaporative surface if

314
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,510
you have more veins than that it doesn't

315
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,089
matter if you're just going to flatline

316
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:41,588
and so this leads to expectations of

317
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,690
what leaves should look like in

318
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:46,600
cross-section these are all cartoons are

319
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,920
all cross-sections of leaves these are

320
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,139
good leaves these are what leaf should

321
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,149
look like if you have a very hot a lot

322
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:53,439
of veins and they're close together you

323
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,350
should this should be in a thin leaf

324
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,790
right

325
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,399
so that those bed D and the Delta are

326
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,719
the same if you have a thick leaf you

327
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,850
can have two different systems going on

328
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,040
if these are immediately placed then

329
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,509
then you said of a very low vein density

330
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,829
but you could also have these things

331
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,840
offset because what matters is not the

332
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,980
actual thickness of the leaf it's the

333
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,620
distance from the veins to the

334
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,389
evaporative surface with the stomata

335
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,389
these are good leaves these are bad

336
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,889
leaves that should not exist there is no

337
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,000
point to having a lot of veins if

338
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:21,379
they're far from that evaporator surface

339
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,389
because that evaporator surface can't

340
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,889
see them and it's just kind of wasteful

341
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:26,169
the construction and displace in the

342
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,659
photosynthetic tissue and so on

343
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,709
similarly this should be a problem

344
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,909
because the tissue immediately in

345
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,290
between these two veins should dry out

346
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:35,269
it shouldn't be getting enough water at

347
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:38,149
all and so you should actually be

348
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:39,919
actively killing stuff down in there so

349
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,350
we have expectations of what leaves

350
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,639
should look like and then they went out

351
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,220
and they measure a bunch of plants and

352
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,659
wow that's a that's a biological paper

353
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,610
and every and they get a relationship

354
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:50,870
that good so this is this is very

355
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,129
present this is the one to one line that

356
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,129
they wanted and everything is right

357
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,450
there on the one in one line from

358
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,299
Finley's down here to thick leaves up

359
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,920
there when I saw this when this came out

360
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:02,449
this was when I was first kind of

361
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,429
sitting down and measuring bein SAT a

362
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,560
lot and it's like all I was doing with

363
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:08,509
my time for a while there and this paper

364
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,879
immediately bothered me because it was a

365
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:14,389
big problem with this and what that

366
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,799
problem was was where the ferns ferns

367
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:17,029
have thin leaves and they have very low

368
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,219
vein densities so they should be

369
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:23,149
plotting out here not on that line and I

370
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,720
watching very well he's a very good

371
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,009
scientist I don't think he's screwed up

372
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,700
but I had a theory about what was going

373
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:34,100
on which was that the authors were all

374
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,140
either hydraulic physiologist or actual

375
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,000
physicists they were probably only

376
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,740
grabbed a bunch of plants during the

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,350
university campus they just grabbed

378
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,450
stuff and they and they measured it if

379
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,639
you do that and you're sampling this

380
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,530
kind of environment and what I suspected

381
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,759
was going on was that it was not just a

382
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,379
simple line that there was a slightly

383
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,689
more complicated relationship for these

384
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,950
different types of leaf types these are

385
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,050
the good leaves here on the line these

386
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,820
are the bad leaves I mentioned this bad

387
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,529
leaf should just never happen

388
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,670
I'm having to over-investing abeyance

389
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,740
there's no reason to ever do that so

390
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:05,569
that shouldn't exist but this could

391
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,789
exist as long as you live in a sheltered

392
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,140
environment so what I suspected one

393
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,370
this original paper and how they got

394
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,919
such a good relationship is they were

395
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,870
only sampling out here as far as degree

396
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,370
of exposure and all those things are

397
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,690
going to be one-to-one but if you got

398
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,950
things living the shade and wet

399
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,240
environments and so on they could fall

400
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,060
off that line and that that's where

401
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,560
you're gonna find the ferns so we went

402
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,899
and we sampled a whole bunch of stuff

403
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,259
and yeah that's what it looks like it's

404
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,970
not aligned since triangle now the first

405
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,250
thing to say about this is that is a

406
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,480
really glorious triangle right they

407
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,470
really did get the hydraulics right and

408
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,120
I had nothing to do with that I wasn't

409
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,259
on that first paper but they really did

410
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,029
get it right because there really is

411
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,740
nothing below that line the one to one

412
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,389
line really is what matters for this so

413
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,680
they I think that's a very good

414
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,970
indication that they really did do that

415
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,669
the hydraulics right they understand

416
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,509
what's going on but yeah we do fill in a

417
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:55,669
triangle here and knowing what all those

418
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,309
different symbols are there really is an

419
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,899
ecological gradient there where the

420
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:01,609
things in expose environments are on the

421
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,259
line and the things that fall off a line

422
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,360
are going to be much more sheltered

423
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,679
environments and there's even gradients

424
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,960
within look like within the ferns and

425
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,419
stuff like that so we saw what we

426
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,290
expected to see but we also saw

427
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:14,839
something that I didn't really

428
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:18,259
anticipate which is there's a big kind

429
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,600
of separation of different file o

430
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,879
genetic lineages as well so I already

431
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,230
mentioned the ferns and yes there's an

432
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,269
ecological gradient here where the ferns

433
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,670
down there are tree ferns and exposed

434
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:31,789
environments and so on versus guys are

435
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:34,009
in deeper shade and they all have been

436
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:35,779
leaves so they none of them can be very

437
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:39,439
good although there can be better or

438
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:41,689
worse gymnosperms also have low vein

439
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,490
densities but they can have thicker

440
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,140
leaves so they can end up actually kind

441
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,919
of grading onto this line by virtue of

442
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:50,360
having very thick leaves so they there

443
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,189
and again there is also this ecological

444
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,629
gradient and I'm not showing the data

445
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,460
but all the fossils we looked at are

446
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,600
actually consistent with that suggesting

447
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,009
that the ecology is that we're seeing

448
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,810
these living guys are consistent and

449
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,580
ferns have always been ferns and cycads

450
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:04,129
boys and cycads ecologically as far as

451
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:07,220
what they can do so we set up the system

452
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,269
where the canopy and and smaller trees

453
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,009
and more open environments are gonna

454
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:11,449
have these thicker leaves and on these

455
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,679
various images they're capable of doing

456
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,890
that whereas these guys can be more

457
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,000
restricted to be sheltered environments

458
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,590
but then all the angiosperms we looked

459
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,789
at violated that in a very interesting

460
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,500
way it doesn't matter where you are

461
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:23,719
ecologically at the angiosperms are on

462
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,279
the line deep shade angiosperms are also

463
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,649
on the line even though they don't have

464
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,500
to be which is very interesting to think

465
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:33,319
about their evolution

466
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,340
except that's derived angiosperms here

467
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,040
the red angiosperms

468
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,470
they look like the ferns so across the

469
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,059
of the basal angiosperms phylogeny they

470
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,529
start out all looking kind of very ferny

471
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,879
in these relationships and then once

472
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,759
they get on that line and more derived

473
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,769
angiosperms they stay there forever and

474
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,470
you can see that here this is plotting

475
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,789
it this is just looking at the ratio so

476
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,050
right so you don't know where you are on

477
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:56,929
this line but you know how far off the

478
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:59,439
line you are and this is everybody here

479
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:03,169
the furniture up here they're not so hot

480
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,330
the the various gymnosperms are slightly

481
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:08,449
better but not so much better and then

482
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:12,220
once all this is the angiosperms anita

483
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:15,080
basel guys this whole backbone is poorly

484
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,509
optimized but the core you dicots

485
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,639
and the drive monocots and specifically

486
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,220
the Loreal ease but the magnolias liz

487
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,319
Marelli's are better than the pipe

488
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,360
Raley's and so on and so the backbone of

489
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,800
this would have been very poorly

490
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,600
optimized and it's several independent

491
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:34,459
lineages within the flowering plants

492
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,080
that figured this out so there's been

493
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,110
there had been kind of a stable system

494
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,240
through time the the things that can

495
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,070
tolerate being open exposed environments

496
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,470
versus the things that couldn't but

497
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,480
could could handle this more sheltered

498
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,740
circumstances and then the angiosperms

499
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,750
came along and completely violated that

500
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,399
whereas these things would have their

501
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,960
thin leaves were incapable of a lot of

502
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,840
gas exchange but didn't necessarily have

503
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,980
a lot of need for that gas exchange

504
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,100
that's what I could handle having so few

505
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,019
vanes whereas these guys or much thicker

506
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,110
and are therefore capable of much less

507
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,190
gas exchange but they're the ones that

508
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,109
actually had the light and so on

509
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,370
what angiosperms did was they figured

510
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,419
out how to take leaves that should have

511
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,309
been in the shade and put them at the

512
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,000
top of the canopy and that's something

513
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,818
that basically only they have to

514
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,019
now which speaks of a lot of what

515
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:23,759
they're doing and how different it is

516
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,410
biologically and these aren't magic

517
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,000
these really are integrating an awful

518
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:31,440
lot about the over a while oh well I'll

519
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,109
do at the plant okay he's got two

520
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,820
different um the rest of this talk I'm

521
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:37,949
going to explore what that actually

522
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,710
means for the earth and for the plants

523
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,029
and the ecosystems and so on to start

524
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,490
out I'm going to talk about this climate

525
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:46,889
here so this is a graph I already showed

526
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,349
you how vein density scales to maximum

527
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,870
transpiration rates transpiration

528
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:54,000
matters particularly if you go to

529
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,739
tropical systems recycling of rainfall

530
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,809
and account for 30 to 50 percent of the

531
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,130
rainfall that falls on a rainforest it

532
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,690
falls out of the sky the plants suck it

533
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,610
up put it back up in the sky so it can

534
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,590
fall down again this is showing this

535
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:06,479
kind of cloud seeding over the forest in

536
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:09,179
the Amazon and president over the forest

537
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,279
not over the ocean in the same way so

538
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,100
that matters and I'm saying that those

539
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,629
transpiration capacities up here would

540
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,829
not have been present before the

541
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,900
evolution of flowering plants in the

542
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,579
same way so that the evolution of

543
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,810
flowering plants is relevant to thinking

544
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:25,429
about the evolution of tropical

545
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:27,629
rainforests now I'm not saying that

546
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,310
flowering plants invented rainforests

547
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,870
there will always be a tropical rainy

548
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,339
belt right here it is stretching across

549
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:35,009
the ocean that is not the distribution

550
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:37,409
of sea grasses there this always always

551
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,690
would have existed and similarly if you

552
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,220
have mountains near near coastline they

553
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,180
can squeeze water out of this guy so

554
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,299
there always would have been little

555
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,950
distributions of rain forests in fact

556
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,529
angiosperms had to have evolved in them

557
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,019
based upon the ecology of basal extant

558
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,779
lineages so they did have to pre exist

559
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:57,029
however transpiration is important to

560
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,069
these systems they may very well have

561
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,240
been important in kind of the spread of

562
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,529
these things depending upon how

563
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,480
important that is and the question

564
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:06,359
becomes well how important is it

565
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,210
so I engaged with a postdoc jungang Lee

566
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:12,469
who is a climate modeler and we look at

567
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:16,950
some of these things plants are part of

568
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,329
climate models as they exist and they

569
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,039
have physiological parameters in there

570
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,179
and what we ended up doing is we just

571
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,950
turn the one knob that had to do with

572
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,900
these physiological rates and looked at

573
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,029
what the outcome

574
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,970
these are standard models for atmosphere

575
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:30,710
notion using modern circumstances modern

576
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,539
condition surface temperatures all we

577
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,000
changed was the transpiration capacity

578
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,470
of the plants and it mattered I'm just

579
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,130
looking at the Amazon based on basin

580
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,670
here this is a difference map so it's

581
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:46,220
showing how much rainfall is lost in the

582
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,259
absence of flowering plants and we have

583
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,120
the same biomass of plants we just

584
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:53,500
changed the physiology of the plants to

585
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:56,750
a non angiosperm kind of mean average

586
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,970
value and at the center that bullseye

587
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:03,079
over losing about 1,500 millimeters of

588
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,460
rainfall per year which is a lot if we

589
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,079
look at that temporally rather than

590
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,170
spatially but this is still over the

591
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,579
Amazon basin there's a variety of

592
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,730
interesting things to see so the blue is

593
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:15,529
is present day and and the blue versus

594
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,130
the black shows how closely the the

595
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:22,940
model corresponds to actual values and

596
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:25,400
in the absence of the flowering plants

597
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,890
the basin is hotter and drier and it's

598
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,470
much more seasonal seasonally it's up to

599
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,810
5 degrees hotter because at the tail end

600
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,880
of that dry season transpiration becomes

601
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,849
very important for the latent the

602
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,500
sensible heat becomes very important for

603
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,699
for cooling off the forest and it gets

604
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,890
much much hotter once you turn off that

605
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,539
transpiration so we're hotter

606
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,610
we're drier and we're more seasonal in

607
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:50,599
the absence of flowering plants being

608
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:52,789
present in the system and overall the

609
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,289
area of what gets defined as ever what

610
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:58,490
rain forest based upon number of rainy

611
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:59,990
days per year drops by 80% there's still

612
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,700
a rain forest band but it much more

613
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,980
current is much more confined to where

614
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,630
the ITCZ that a tropical rainy belt

615
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,120
would be situated it's not that

616
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,990
massively expensive amazon basin that we

617
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:14,259
have now I'm showing you the Amazon

618
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,970
because that's where it works the best

619
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:19,519
you can see that here there are global

620
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,319
effects they are less severe in other

621
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,629
places and they are less severe for

622
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,929
fairly obvious reasons

623
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,250
Africa is high topographically and you

624
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,920
have the East African plateau which

625
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,329
constrains where you can get

626
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,690
precipitation from so it's hard to make

627
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:36,349
africa wet and Southeast Asia is a bunch

628
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,850
of mountainous Isle

629
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:39,529
in the tropics it's hard to make them

630
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:41,389
dry you can't make them dry

631
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:44,119
so there's reasons for for--why the

632
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,620
impact is less in other places but like

633
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,729
in Eastern North America it's still a

634
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:51,048
50% really reduction in in precipitation

635
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,058
is just a different color because

636
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:55,700
there's less overall it's still 50% of

637
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:57,769
what's going on and there's reason to

638
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,080
think that what's going on in the Amazon

639
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,129
basin I think is perhaps relevant to

640
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,389
some things that are going on in Earth

641
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,750
history

642
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,910
this is the Eocene here the dark

643
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,349
hatching is a distribution of tropical

644
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,320
aspect rainforests even though some of

645
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:14,599
these things are rather high latitudes I

646
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,339
think the fact that there was this kind

647
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,548
of extreme spread under these warm

648
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:21,408
circumstances in the Eocene made very

649
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,700
what well have been related to the

650
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,260
transpiration capacities of that

651
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,850
vegetation which was flowering plant

652
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:28,759
dominated and one way to think about

653
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:30,709
that is if we this was not the only time

654
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:32,210
the earth has been very warm if we go

655
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:37,370
back a little bit earlier hoops that's

656
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,029
the wrong way back to earlier in the

657
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:40,548
Cretaceous

658
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,048
it was also warm but what we're talking

659
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:44,210
about in North America and so on is

660
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:46,250
seasonal aridity and the difference is

661
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,230
turnover and what that vegetation is was

662
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,940
composed of what this forest canopies

663
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,829
would create it would've been much less

664
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,779
transpiration in this world in any case

665
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,949
if you just thought about the physical

666
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,389
nature of this world this should have

667
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,650
been the wetter world because this is

668
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,090
when we have lots of internal sea waves

669
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,650
breaking up these continents and the

670
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:02,720
pathway from moisture movement should

671
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,370
have been much less so just kind of

672
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,538
based up on those reasons this should be

673
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,829
wet and this should be dry but that's

674
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:10,669
the app opposite of what we actually see

675
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,629
so I think this could have been very

676
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:13,130
important earlier in Earth history

677
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,880
earlier in the history of angiosperms in

678
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:19,520
particular and it also sets up a very

679
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,620
interesting dynamic because plant

680
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,079
diversity itself is tied to

681
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:26,149
precipitation levels this is some work

682
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,829
of correction yes here or what they're

683
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,419
showing is that this is potential

684
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:31,158
evapotranspiration so this is kind of

685
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:33,470
how warm it is how much water you could

686
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:36,380
evaporate which is related to solar

687
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,298
influx and what it shows is that looking

688
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,159
at diversity and lots of localities

689
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:42,408
around the world and what it shows is

690
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,120
that if you're cold getting warmer

691
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:45,130
matters

692
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,079
right that's this area here but once

693
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,250
you're relatively warm getting warmer

694
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,939
still doesn't doesn't make a difference

695
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:55,720
what does make a difference is

696
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:57,730
precipitation so and and this is also

697
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,890
you know where angiosperms are the most

698
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,690
hyper diverse so they are creating the

699
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,000
very environments where much of their

700
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,559
diversity is situated they're

701
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,789
propagating them out much larger than

702
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:11,259
they otherwise would have been based

703
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:12,789
just on physical parameters and then

704
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,990
that does matter also for animal

705
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:17,259
diversity and everything else these are

706
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,789
looking at primate diversity and animal

707
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:20,200
diversity is also correlated with

708
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,269
rainfall abundance evenness and

709
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,380
rainforest area to the monkeys care that

710
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,970
is raining I don't think the monkeys

711
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,970
care but they put the plants care and

712
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,110
they care about the plants so

713
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,089
terrestrial diversity as a whole is

714
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,399
gonna be very much impacted by the

715
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:35,559
evolution of this physiology that is

716
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,660
unique to the flowering plants and I

717
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:40,240
think you can perhaps even see this in

718
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,519
other lineages of plants this is a fern

719
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,190
phylogeny where the green is evolution

720
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,569
of epiphytic ferns the lines there you

721
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,029
can read that at all but the lines here

722
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,919
represent the KT boundary which is the

723
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:53,289
end of the Mesozoic started the Cenozoic

724
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,350
flowering plants evolved around in here

725
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:58,690
and all these lineages of epiphytic

726
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:59,769
plants are evolving after this

727
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,529
transition to a flower and plant

728
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:04,990
dominated world these guys are the filmy

729
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:06,579
ferns they're they're kind of crazy but

730
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,880
I think there's plenty bit reasons to

731
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,740
ignore them but if you look her in Earth

732
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,840
history

733
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,579
where are the epiphytes so this is the

734
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,949
Triassic of Greenland it would have been

735
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:20,470
the warmest consistently what placed at

736
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,230
the time the tropics at that time were

737
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,339
more seasonally dry so this is as close

738
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,039
as you're gonna get to a rainforest type

739
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:29,669
situation there play these plants have

740
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,250
been reconstructed as Liana's or vines

741
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:35,350
but there's no epiphytes and i think

742
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,509
this may reflect this transition where

743
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:40,119
amplifies are going to be very dependent

744
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:41,950
upon the regularity of rainfall and that

745
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,089
regularity is going to be buffered by

746
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,629
the existence of flowering plants in

747
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:49,418
these in these later time periods

748
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:51,398
so I think their evolution has greatly

749
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:54,340
impacted climate in a way that then also

750
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:57,308
impacts just diversity of both the

751
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:58,778
plants themselves and and and everybody

752
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:59,638
else that goes along with them in these

753
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:03,220
ecosystems

754
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:05,888
that's climate this is also I think an

755
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,589
be very relevant for productivity now I

756
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:10,329
showed graphs that were just very kind

757
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:12,249
of clear-cut productivity should scale

758
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:13,269
at vane density it gets a lot more

759
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:15,389
complicated than that

760
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:17,230
and bear with me please because

761
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:19,479
productivity is also be dependent upon

762
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,179
other factors the most obvious of which

763
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,409
is going to be atmospheric co2 and that

764
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,480
has fluctuated quite a bit we're

765
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:30,070
actually now in a very low level of co2

766
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,960
versus the distant past and that initial

767
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:33,579
paper would on bein done see what there

768
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,600
was four of us we're all expatriates of

769
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:37,418
Missy Holbrooke slab we were all

770
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,069
postdocs at the same time there and two

771
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:40,690
of those authors were Tim broad ribbon

772
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,740
Taylor field and they worked went off

773
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,690
and measured a whole bunch of more

774
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,099
angiosperms more than I ever cared to do

775
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,490
because they're the hardest things to

776
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:50,699
measure and which was great but then

777
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,230
they also kind of developed a model over

778
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,269
how this relates to carbon dioxide

779
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,399
changes through time that I felt was

780
00:26:55,269 --> 00:27:00,399
very problematic and what they argued

781
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:03,459
was that the effective main density is

782
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:05,199
going to saturate at high carbon dioxide

783
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,028
concentrations so that there's no

784
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,909
advantage for high vein density when co2

785
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:12,159
is high and it's only a co2 declined

786
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,840
from the Cretaceous to the present that

787
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,639
suddenly becomes in these high vein

788
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,959
density values become useful and that's

789
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:18,668
when these things are occurring so a

790
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,940
leak the evolution of angiosperms to

791
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,649
declines in co2 through time and they

792
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,220
talked about this in terms of a big

793
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:28,658
increase in photosynthetic potential I

794
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,579
was kind of concerned by this model

795
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:32,590
though because the back end of it is

796
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,939
problematic so what this graph here

797
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:36,849
shows and it was just kind of in the

798
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,350
supplementals was different crops versus

799
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:39,519
tropical trees versus non angiosperms

800
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,388
and what they do in the modern world and

801
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,368
there's these big differences between

802
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:46,959
them but sure everything saturates at

803
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:48,849
high co2 but they haven't saturating way

804
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,950
the heck of it here so what this is

805
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:53,618
saying is any crappy fern if you get

806
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,929
enough co2 it would be much more

807
00:27:53,618 --> 00:28:00,459
productive than mazes

808
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:03,309
right now and that felt wrong and this

809
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,139
actually fits into a larger debate I

810
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,940
mean this is evolutionary biology and so

811
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:09,638
the debate happens at the rate of you

812
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,048
know paper every five years but a

813
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:12,969
variety of people have come out on

814
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:15,099
either side of this where there's a a

815
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,778
variety of people that are very kind of

816
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:19,509
invested in carbon dioxide through time

817
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:22,378
and wanting to make this as the driver

818
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:24,999
of much of what's going on in evolution

819
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:26,769
and this is the paper I was just talking

820
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:28,600
about bra driven field and then a

821
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,859
variety of these others as well a lot of

822
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,099
them led by David Bering and his

823
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:35,949
students so there's this focus on this

824
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:38,319
extrinsic driver of co2 in other cases

825
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,700
and not really kind of not always aware

826
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,839
of what they're arguing against I

827
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,759
certainly wasn't aware of it in some of

828
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,868
the cases I was arguing against this are

829
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,249
people that have focused much more on

830
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:47,259
the intrinsic biology of the plants

831
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:49,329
I think the best-known of these would be

832
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,778
bonds great paper about The Tortoise and

833
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,740
the hare

834
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:53,980
and the differences in the potential

835
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,628
ecology of angiosperms versus uh he was

836
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,628
largely talking about conifers but you

837
00:28:55,628 --> 00:29:01,079
can expand it beyond there and so you

838
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:03,668
know the same co2 changes are occurring

839
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,019
but there's just no interest in

840
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:06,999
emphasizing that as far as what's

841
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,999
driving the changes in the ecology

842
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:11,558
through time and I thought that this

843
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,970
model might be an actual very

844
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,418
interesting way to test some of this

845
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,009
because the model they uses is

846
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:19,090
reasonable it's the same photosynthetic

847
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,929
models they've been used since the early

848
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,308
1980s

849
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:23,288
they've been very well vetted and so on

850
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:24,548
and but they found a way to include vein

851
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:26,798
density in it which is another way to

852
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,148
get at the fossil record and they

853
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,609
actually set up some very interesting

854
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:32,528
tests here they emphasize this flat line

855
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:35,979
and why there's no advantage to high of

856
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:37,148
aim density when co2 is high but they

857
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,368
didn't talk about which I find it much

858
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:42,308
more interesting is just how steep this

859
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:44,168
is because no plants ever no other

860
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:46,648
plants besides the angiosperms ever made

861
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:49,778
it up here but any plant can do this

862
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:51,459
within this pink range here and if this

863
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:53,048
is an extrinsic driver it should be

864
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,569
affecting all plants equally that's

865
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:56,618
what's inherent in this graph here and

866
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,499
how they have the ferns getting so

867
00:29:56,618 --> 00:30:01,898
productive as well but what that means

868
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:03,929
is that if you're at this down at this

869
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:05,918
lower range of what other plants do any

870
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,240
incremental increase in your vein

871
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,370
density is good

872
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,980
huge difference in what you can do as a

873
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:13,449
plan in ways that should not matter for

874
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,730
the overall hydraulics of the plant but

875
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,140
what it just means is that when co2 is

876
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,730
that high and photosynthetic rates can

877
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,500
be that high if you're not doing it all

878
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,509
the time you're gonna get overgrown just

879
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,240
like that so there's a huge disadvantage

880
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:26,980
to having very low vein densities and

881
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,230
the expectation would be that the look

882
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,089
the upper bound maybe that just can't

883
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,529
change outside of the angiosperms but

884
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:35,500
the lower bound and everybody should

885
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:37,899
increase at times of high carbon dioxide

886
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:42,069
concentrations you should lose the lower

887
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:44,530
half of this pink range here and it just

888
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:46,539
doesn't happen so this is this is one of

889
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:48,940
burners models or this is co2 through

890
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,829
time showing the time periods that we we

891
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,380
looked at and we look at vane density at

892
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:56,199
these time periods and there's no change

893
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,780
there's no dependence upon the co2 what

894
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,370
that lower bound looks like the medians

895
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:03,399
in all these cases are basically down in

896
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:06,639
this zone where there should be nothing

897
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,500
at all and it's not really impacted and

898
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm not showing the data but there's a

899
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,549
variety of co2 models and if you try the

900
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:14,558
different ones it's all the same you

901
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:18,399
know the location of these of these bars

902
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,389
will change up and down but but there's

903
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,429
always stuff up here and there's always

904
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,130
stuff down there and and there's no

905
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:26,980
effect on the vane density so this

906
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:29,500
didn't work so something's wrong with

907
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,289
that with that model and yet it's it's a

908
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,269
good model right so we got curious about

909
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,349
whether we could figure out you know

910
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:36,700
rather than just saying this is wrong

911
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:38,769
and walking away saying well what

912
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,650
happened and and can we improve upon it

913
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:43,150
so this is the model that they use the

914
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,820
way they incorporated vane density into

915
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:49,090
these photosynthetic models so they got

916
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:51,099
leaf conductance via the vane density as

917
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:53,859
pure as per those empirical graphs that

918
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:55,299
the Tim broader did himself so um so

919
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:57,069
that's how they got the leaf conductance

920
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:58,450
and then flow into the leaf is going to

921
00:31:57,069 --> 00:32:01,299
be dependent on a leaf conductance and

922
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,860
the water potential gradient and then

923
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,509
the flow into the leaf has to balance

924
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:07,449
the evaporation from the leaf which is

925
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:10,150
gonna be related to the vapor pressure

926
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,980
deficits and stomata conductance so then

927
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,230
we can get stomata conductance from the

928
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,630
vane density and then that can be

929
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,710
plugged into a model of the physical

930
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,650
limits of diffusion on

931
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,759
co2 getting into the leaf and then that

932
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,350
can be solved simultaneously with a

933
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,390
different model of photosynthesis based

934
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:27,740
upon the biochemistry you saw those

935
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,770
simultaneously and that's how you end up

936
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,839
with with these curves here so is there

937
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:33,769
a way that we can kind of fix what they

938
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:36,529
did to actually get something that

939
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:38,690
worked with the fossil record the first

940
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,980
correction we did was getting back to

941
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,538
that thing I showed you about leaf

942
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,380
thickness because they used all these

943
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:44,629
being the same thickness

944
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,039
when actuality it should in some ways

945
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,929
correlate with the vein density that

946
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,609
they're showing it was very gratifying

947
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:52,610
we did that correction and so they had

948
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:54,889
some empirical data that they used to to

949
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:56,209
correlate there their graph and our

950
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,500
correction actually matches their data

951
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,819
better so that made us happy but then

952
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,099
when you look at the resulting curve it

953
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:07,668
doesn't really matter you still have a

954
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:09,459
big disadvantage to the lower end of the

955
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:12,049
vein densities that any plants can do

956
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,179
and this is showing the rate gained in

957
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:15,980
the simulation with vein density here

958
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,750
and you can see how much it matters it

959
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,339
if you can creep up out of this root

960
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,929
zone here as far as the overall

961
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:24,980
photosynthetic gain that would be

962
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:26,630
possible so that didn't help we tried a

963
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,038
variety of other Corrections they didn't

964
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,150
really play with oxygen whereas that's

965
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:31,190
going to affect for the respiration rate

966
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,950
and oxygen also has fluctuated through

967
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,808
time we played with stomata conductivity

968
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,400
which should go up and down with carbon

969
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:39,379
dioxide concentrations independently of

970
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,230
what's going on with the veins we tried

971
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,360
all those things and none of them matter

972
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,370
so none of these Corrections matter and

973
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:49,459
then they only looked at discretely like

974
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:51,379
low versus high co2 we look at it

975
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,750
continuously we're here the colors are

976
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,669
the assimilation rates but we look

977
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,798
continuously at all potential co2

978
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:00,110
concentrations and you just see how the

979
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:02,048
colors stack up here it doesn't matter

980
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:04,069
once once you have this low co2 regime

981
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:05,900
it matters immensely

982
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:09,489
getting a little bit higher in these

983
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:13,010
vain densities and they don't do it so

984
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:16,398
none of these corrections to what they

985
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,389
did make any difference whatsoever so we

986
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,349
have to look a little bit beyond that

987
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:23,419
and the one solution that does work is

988
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:27,079
if we just say maybe ferns can't be

989
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:29,599
sunflowers if we lower this VC max

990
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,338
maximum carboxylation rate and just

991
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,250
assign different rates to different

992
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:34,378
lineages it

993
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,510
she solves everything because what ended

994
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:40,230
up happening then is that you still have

995
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:42,510
a plateau related to vein density and at

996
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,280
different co2 concentrations but what

997
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,000
happens is the high co2 concentrations

998
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,220
that plateau occurs right at the base of

999
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,320
vein densities that plants do anyway so

1000
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,658
basically ferns don't care about certain

1001
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,220
co2 concentrations in that regard

1002
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,470
higher co2 concentrations they're not

1003
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,659
going to be any more productive is the

1004
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:02,069
argument there and that it's really only

1005
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,429
the angiosperms that are potentially

1006
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:07,380
going up going up there now that goes in

1007
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:09,179
the model as maximum carboxylation rate

1008
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,800
but again this is something where it's

1009
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:14,069
integrating the overall biology of the

1010
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,769
plant carboxylation Rubisco that is very

1011
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,970
co2 dependent sure and so and people

1012
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:20,250
have always kind of assumed that it

1013
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:22,319
should just track co2 but you also have

1014
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,460
to the whole rest of the calvin cycle in

1015
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,530
the regeneration of rubp

1016
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,389
that is not co2 dependent and then

1017
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,070
there's a variety of other things that

1018
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:31,409
have to do with productivity like

1019
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,039
phosphorus and nitrogen that use need if

1020
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:33,480
you're going to be that much more

1021
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,889
productive you need more phosphorus and

1022
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,349
nitrogen and there's some indication

1023
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:39,088
that that's actively kind of gets harder

1024
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,250
su2 concentrations increase

1025
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:42,599
alright the very least it's unrelated so

1026
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,170
there's plenty of reasons to think that

1027
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:50,280
you can't just amp up co2 and expect

1028
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:52,139
everything to go along with it ok is

1029
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,990
there other reasons to think that this

1030
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,400
might be true if we take exit and plants

1031
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,469
and these are all just numbers from the

1032
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,838
literature and give them elevated co2

1033
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:03,838
concentrations what happens yes if

1034
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:06,389
flowering plants end up here ferns and

1035
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,070
conifers that have been done don't so

1036
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:10,529
this is consistent right and there's no

1037
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,690
ferns out here potentially to go up

1038
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,490
there as far as their vein densities and

1039
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,108
yet you know what and within the range

1040
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:17,759
that they do exist there doesn't appear

1041
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:20,098
to be much of an impact of elevating

1042
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,349
that carbon dioxide concentration people

1043
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:23,460
haven't focused upon that because

1044
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:25,830
they're more interest in these overall

1045
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,699
patterns and the big things up there but

1046
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,960
there's no reason to think that these

1047
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,838
guys could have responded in that way

1048
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,280
based upon this and it's even consistent

1049
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,889
in a very fun way with the fossil record

1050
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,570
so this is data from a follow-up paper

1051
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:37,858
from these guys on Levi taylor field

1052
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,349
where they measured a whole bunch of

1053
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:42,029
cretaceous plants the black circles are

1054
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:44,230
non angiosperms the white circles are

1055
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,269
angiosperms

1056
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,949
we look at the black circle if they say

1057
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:50,170
what what I've been saying that there's

1058
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:52,179
no response to whatever fluctuations of

1059
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:54,880
co2 went on in this time period they're

1060
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:56,108
just kind of merrily continuing on with

1061
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,930
this flatline as far as their vein

1062
00:36:56,108 --> 00:37:00,848
densities early flowering plants

1063
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:02,319
share that full range including the

1064
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:04,119
lower half below that yellow line which

1065
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,030
is corresponds to that that steep part

1066
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:09,039
of the gradient there as they evolve the

1067
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,540
high vein densities and presumably the

1068
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,820
various physiological capacities that go

1069
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:15,699
along with that they lose those those

1070
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,890
main messages so they are responding the

1071
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:19,179
way you might expect if this model was

1072
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:22,239
correct but it's only the flowering

1073
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:24,669
plants to do it so I think this is

1074
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,929
potentially a very useful way to

1075
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,280
actually bring the fossil record to bear

1076
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:29,259
on some of these relationships that have

1077
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,990
been proposed these are this is the

1078
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,599
graph I've shown explicitly versus co2

1079
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:38,949
concentrations these papers various

1080
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:43,000
papers from David burling's work just is

1081
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:45,129
relative to time and this is largely

1082
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,750
tied to co2 fluctuations and I think

1083
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,740
basically you can throw out the top half

1084
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,358
of all these graphs they never got there

1085
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:55,299
and I think there's even reasons to

1086
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:57,190
think independent reasons that they

1087
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,720
couldn't have ever gotten there which is

1088
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,159
all of these graphs are ultimately

1089
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,409
dependent upon the work of Bob burner

1090
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:06,699
and his modeling of co2 concentrations

1091
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:08,858
through time and burner is very explicit

1092
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:10,689
about what goes into his model and

1093
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:12,190
plants are a big part of it because the

1094
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,500
primary draw down of co2 from the

1095
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,940
atmosphere is via silicate weathering

1096
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,449
and that's largely mediated by plants

1097
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,510
all the acids pumped down into the soil

1098
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:24,429
by roots and so on increases that so the

1099
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,819
biggest feedback on co2 concentrations

1100
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:29,230
are plants and the idea is that as you

1101
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:31,480
have if you have more co2 if there's

1102
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,309
more productivity and that leads to the

1103
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,199
drawdown of more co2 and so co2 comes

1104
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:39,909
back down and he tries he has these

1105
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,250
sensitivity analyses looking at the

1106
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:44,500
levels of carbon dioxide fertilization

1107
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,269
and and it's right there in his papers

1108
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,719
oh if you had as much co2 fertilization

1109
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:51,338
as shows up in these grand graphs then

1110
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,699
you wouldn't get any change in co2 at

1111
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:53,529
all

1112
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,239
because it would just be swamped out by

1113
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,230
the plants immediately sucking up that

1114
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,229
co2 and

1115
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,030
with the silicate weathering ultimately

1116
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,789
the silicate weathering of rocks on land

1117
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,340
ends up in carbonate rocks in the oceans

1118
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:08,650
and so there's definitely a co2

1119
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,070
fertilization effect but if it was as

1120
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,170
extreme as as these paper papers

1121
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,340
rely they wouldn't get the co2 curve

1122
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,358
that they're using to generate those

1123
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,858
graphs in the first place so that big it

1124
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,319
couldn't been that productive yeah it

1125
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,819
just wouldn't worked out in that way so

1126
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,230
I think productivity really has greatly

1127
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,720
increased with the evolution of

1128
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,400
flowering plants as well otherwise he

1129
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,689
may be the baseline of these papers is

1130
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,780
that we're actually living in a world

1131
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:36,250
that is very deep operating and very

1132
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,530
less lush than it used to be and that I

1133
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,409
find that hard to believe right so that

1134
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,390
that's just an internal bias on my part

1135
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:44,739
but it doesn't feel right to think that

1136
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:47,199
the most productive environments were

1137
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:49,529
ferns in the Jurassic relatives what we

1138
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,529
have now

1139
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:55,570
so climates changed a lot productivity

1140
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,069
has changed a lot and I think that as a

1141
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:59,710
last step and this is just a couple

1142
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,750
slides I promise it's been interesting

1143
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,510
to use that to think back to the earlier

1144
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,130
record and and as I said this is really

1145
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,630
where what I like to think about the

1146
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,358
most but this becomes very important

1147
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:13,660
because paleo ecology has to be founded

1148
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,639
on modern ecology and modern ecology is

1149
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:16,839
flowering plants there's no place on

1150
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,219
earth in the terrestrial environments

1151
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,590
where flowering plants don't represent

1152
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:22,059
at least 90 percent of the species even

1153
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,980
if you go to Siberia most of the biomass

1154
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:25,719
will be the same couple species of

1155
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,858
conifers but most of the species are

1156
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,029
gonna still be row basis plants

1157
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:31,690
underneath that that are all flowering

1158
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:35,530
plants so modern ecology is flowering

1159
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:37,809
plant ecology but everything I'm saying

1160
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,519
says that that probably is not a good

1161
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:42,250
way of thinking about this system here

1162
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,199
back in the Carboniferous and there's a

1163
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,449
variety of the implications of that I'm

1164
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:47,919
just going to kind of touch on a couple

1165
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:49,358
but this is kind of the stuff that

1166
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,840
interests me the most at this point

1167
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,400
going forward one this sometimes gets

1168
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,720
maligned by a call just now I don't I

1169
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,389
don't know why I kind of like it it's

1170
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:02,739
useful this is Grimes triangle looking

1171
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:04,480
at ecology based upon kind of different

1172
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:06,669
guilds of competitors your stately oak

1173
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,320
trees and so on versus weeds

1174
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,519
things that reproduce very quickly use a

1175
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,680
lot of resources and then

1176
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,000
reproduce and die versus stressed

1177
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,469
tolerate errs they're slow growing and

1178
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,599
also have a very low reproductive output

1179
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:22,449
and this is related to intensity of

1180
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,069
stress and disturbance and so on but two

1181
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:27,039
of these three vertices here are

1182
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:29,230
dependent upon high productivity so

1183
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,329
basically I think that this is

1184
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,130
angiosperms and in the world without

1185
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:35,139
angiosperms you still have some

1186
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,349
differentiation here but we're talking

1187
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:40,150
about a much more limited triangle

1188
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:42,519
basically I mentioned this to build a

1189
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,470
michael who is a paleo ecologist and he

1190
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,789
said and his immediate response is yeah

1191
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:48,549
like I was on my high school football

1192
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:52,000
team and if you know build a Michael

1193
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,340
he's about that big and and not big in

1194
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,170
any dimension but in a high school team

1195
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,840
there's just less competition so

1196
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,220
relative to the NFL so there's still

1197
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,600
becoming differentiation within this

1198
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:03,789
space because it's we much more limited

1199
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,799
than what we see in the modern world

1200
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:07,929
based upon the fact that we're much more

1201
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,260
constructed constricted in this this

1202
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:13,569
range of photosynthetic potential and I

1203
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,340
think there's evidence that that is

1204
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,019
gonna be present because I'm basically

1205
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,420
I'm talking about world without weeds in

1206
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:21,639
a very real sense and I think that that

1207
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:25,240
may be correct right we have herbaceous

1208
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:26,920
plants but we don't have annuals really

1209
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,118
in the fossil record now in part that's

1210
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,190
also can be tied to angiosperm

1211
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:33,400
reproductive biology right so this isn't

1212
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:35,230
the whole story but things like Bracken

1213
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,670
is the one thing that gets often brought

1214
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,858
up in this kind of context as being a

1215
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,619
competitor it's slow growing it's not a

1216
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:43,239
competitor by any kind of modern sense

1217
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:44,590
it's just that it's hard for other once

1218
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,719
it's there there's an incumbency effect

1219
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:49,000
and things can't grow up through it but

1220
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,679
it is definitely not a rule a weed and

1221
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,889
it's not really a proper competitor by

1222
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:55,690
it by these if by these modes and kind

1223
00:42:53,889 --> 00:42:59,500
of one last thing to think about in this

1224
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:01,539
regard this is an over sampling of the

1225
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,070
Westphalian be in the Carboniferous so

1226
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:05,440
this is less than a million years this

1227
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,760
is effectively one time slice I chose

1228
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,960
this time slice one because we have a

1229
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,570
lot of fossils from the Carboniferous

1230
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,849
and also co2 concentrations were about

1231
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,260
what they are now then so even if you

1232
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:18,549
don't like what I said about carbon

1233
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:20,560
dioxide photosynthesis would be tight of

1234
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,980
a density then the way it is now because

1235
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,980
it's the same

1236
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:26,360
we have a lot of lady jizz here I've

1237
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,010
sampled this about as well as we had in

1238
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,530
that original paper sampled modern

1239
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,750
plants so we know this as well as any

1240
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,220
other time flies and these are all from

1241
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,500
England right so this is all basically

1242
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:39,169
one flora and there are some

1243
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,239
differentiation there but there is all

1244
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:43,909
incredibly low relative to what's seen

1245
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:48,229
in living flowering plants everything

1246
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:50,839
everything is maximally what you would

1247
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,880
only expect to see in the deep shade if

1248
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,530
we're talking in an angiosperm system

1249
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,210
and they're largely even lower than that

1250
00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:01,430
kind of thing which I think it's kind of

1251
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:04,570
fun to think about in terms of just the

1252
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:07,309
original evolution of vascular flora

1253
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,930
it's often kind of couched as kind of

1254
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:10,940
reaching for the light as far as why we

1255
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:14,119
evolved trees on so like that I only

1256
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,289
mean these things cared about like I

1257
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,609
don't think any of them were light

1258
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:21,230
limited they had other things to worry

1259
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:22,910
about and that no one would these none

1260
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,260
of these plants were desperately wanting

1261
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:28,399
the light levels that a modern

1262
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,380
angiosperm tree wants and and yet that's

1263
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,789
kind of often when we look at them and

1264
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,650
this is a graph I put together myself

1265
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:36,079
many years ago I'm so I'm as guilty of

1266
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,849
it as anyone else but very often when we

1267
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,009
think about kind of the Devonian

1268
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:42,650
evolution the Paleozoic evolution of

1269
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,460
vascular plants it's implicitly there

1270
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,930
that were talking on ecological

1271
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,970
succession and what goes on in

1272
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:48,230
ecological succession but these guys are

1273
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:50,329
all fighting over light in a way that I

1274
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,130
don't think was going on here and it

1275
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:53,269
gets into questions about why be a tree

1276
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,470
at all then all right if you're not

1277
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:56,139
trying to shade your neighbors and you

1278
00:44:54,469 --> 00:45:00,169
get to the light why are you doing this

1279
00:44:56,139 --> 00:45:01,670
and I think that there can be a variety

1280
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,430
of kind of non-intuitive but interesting

1281
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,630
things to explore in this regard of it

1282
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:06,169
couldn't part be related to being

1283
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,059
long-lived

1284
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,200
because plants keep growing and and they

1285
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:10,789
can't really avoid it

1286
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,889
it can even be involved with things like

1287
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:14,000
like rooting death instead where if

1288
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:15,440
you're rhizomatous you're never gonna

1289
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,449
get roots they're that deep with these

1290
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,269
adventitious roots where there can be a

1291
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:21,559
point to being a deep rooted plant but

1292
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:22,610
that's something that only trees can do

1293
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,558
so it could be as much about what

1294
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,920
they're doing growing down

1295
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:29,259
growing up one example of this that's

1296
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,079
fairly local is bill Stein over at

1297
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:36,369
Binghamton has has a locality where they

1298
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,650
where they have these casts of the tree

1299
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,838
stumps and there's one kind of basal

1300
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,789
relative one of these guys here actually

1301
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:46,058
although that actually might be a basal

1302
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:49,509
see plant but a relative of the seed

1303
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:51,400
plants growing rise ominously and it

1304
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:53,170
goes from about here all the way across

1305
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,729
that room that would been many many

1306
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,499
years of growth and throughout that

1307
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:58,448
growth if the thing is gonna stay alive

1308
00:45:56,498 --> 00:46:00,159
it has to keep growing but if your eyes

1309
00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:01,539
amitis growing horizontally you're

1310
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,239
constantly changing your environment as

1311
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:05,289
you go whereas there might be a point to

1312
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,358
sitting in one spot if you need

1313
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:09,099
long-lived and growing up and it also

1314
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,199
allows you then to extract more

1315
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:14,229
nutrients at depth and more water and so

1316
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,298
on so it might be more complicated than

1317
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:18,489
then the easy analogy that's available

1318
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:23,768
from modern ecological succession and

1319
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:26,309
basing things on light ok one conclusion

1320
00:46:23,768 --> 00:46:28,208
slide so why are plants are different

1321
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:29,829
and they're different in ways

1322
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:31,989
morphologically that translates to their

1323
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:34,359
physiology and that because physiology

1324
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,679
matters for climate and climate is

1325
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:38,798
relevant to the fact that they're all so

1326
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,298
hyper diverse and and and biodiversity

1327
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:42,369
in these environments which they

1328
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:44,949
dominate which is all environments

1329
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:46,509
they're also more productive in a way

1330
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:48,039
that I think is is not going to be

1331
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:49,599
related to carbon dioxide the way it has

1332
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:53,189
been often related in the older

1333
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,479
literature in the current literature and

1334
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:57,818
the fact that they're so different

1335
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:59,919
it makes it problematic to easily kind

1336
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:02,079
of translate from modern ecology to

1337
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,719
paleo ecology what's going on there and

1338
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,859
it's kind of a last point here I haven't

1339
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,639
talked about flowers I've been talking

1340
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:08,889
about flowering plants having talked

1341
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,808
about flowers at all and very often when

1342
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:12,248
people talk about flowering plant

1343
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:13,719
evolution they're focusing on the

1344
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:16,988
differences in the reproductive biology

1345
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:21,909
and they certainly are extreme and they

1346
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:23,798
matter a lot in a lot of ways both but

1347
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,308
as far as their overall dominance of the

1348
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:25,958
planet

1349
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:28,689
I think the vegetative biology is as

1350
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:29,828
relevant right because I'm sure if

1351
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:31,028
you're gonna have two hundred fifty

1352
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:33,339
thousand five hundred thousand species

1353
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:34,650
whatever it is most of those have to be

1354
00:47:33,338 --> 00:47:36,358
rare right

1355
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,450
and the reproductive biology of

1356
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:42,058
angiosperms is very good at keeping rare

1357
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:44,308
species sure that's great but they're

1358
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:46,230
also most of the biomass and I think

1359
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:49,410
that that really comes down to their

1360
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:51,150
vegetative biology the the reproductive

1361
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:53,338
biology allows them to subdivide all

1362
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,630
that real estate very finely but the

1363
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:55,889
reason they have all that real estate in

1364
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,210
the first place I think is income much

1365
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:59,308
more down to their vegetative biology

1366
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,778
that's at least as important when

1367
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,990
thinking about the role of angiosperms

1368
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:12,480
in the modern world and how they evolved

1369
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:14,939
okay thank you this has been a
