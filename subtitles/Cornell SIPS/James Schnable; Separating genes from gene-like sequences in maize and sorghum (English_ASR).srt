1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:07,520
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:10,370
University good thank you all so much

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,379
for the chance to be here really fun

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:14,628
both the conversations i've had over the

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,000
last two days I also just came to wander

6
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:19,368
around campus again about 15 years since

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,079
I first showed up here so we had a

8
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:22,550
conversation at dinner last night about

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,899
some of the digital AG stuff that is

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,859
going on here at Cornell so I want to

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,809
highlight before I get into my talk this

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,580
is my research group as of last summer

13
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,869
at University of nebraska-lincoln but a

14
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,420
lot of the stuff I'm going to tell you

15
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:37,789
about is only possible because we were

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,250
collaborating with folks like you fungo

17
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,479
who's a biological systems engineer and

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,189
you moe and you hyung who are both

19
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,839
statisticians at University of Nebraska

20
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:47,449
so it's really being able to work with

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,130
folks across different disciplines that

22
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,469
lets us do really really cool stuff that

23
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,250
to me seems extraordinarily hard and to

24
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,159
them it's quite easy and then we get to

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:01,280
also brandy Sigmund who is an actual

26
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:03,559
developmental geneticist which is fun so

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,480
I'm going to start with a sort of broad

28
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,650
question then we're going to move into

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,030
some phenomics then into some

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,930
quantitative genetics can come back to

31
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,450
sort of broad conceptual stuff so now

32
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,190
for our question here which is you know

33
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,630
I think one of the central questions of

34
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,730
all genetics is how do we find which

35
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:22,339
Janee which genes determine the

36
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,990
characteristics of maize or any organism

37
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,880
and I like to bring this up because I

38
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:28,069
want you to think about you know what

39
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:32,899
actually we mean when we say the word

40
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:34,158
gene so when I first started out in grad

41
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,219
school the maize genome had just come

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,480
out there about 32,000 gene models then

43
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,060
there was a revision that went up from

44
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,400
about 32,000 to about 40,000 another

45
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,359
revision it went up for about 60,000 so

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,190
about the time that I got my own lab we

47
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,709
were adding about 5,000 genes to the

48
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,509
genome every year now if it takes one

49
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:55,699
grad student five years to characterize

50
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,830
one gene you can see that just from a is

51
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,140
we would need about 25,000 graduate

52
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,819
students and about 1.25 billion dollars

53
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,890
a year in funding to keep up now

54
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,719
obviously this would not be sustainable

55
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,770
for a lot of reasons working you know

56
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,270
government policy and NSF and all that

57
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,950
it also is clearly not what's happening

58
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,080
maize was not adding a lot of new genes

59
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,879
to the genome what was half

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
we were using different criteria and had

61
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,009
different evidence for what constitutes

62
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,900
a gene model so if you go into Google

63
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:26,620
Scholar and you type in what is a gene

64
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,050
you will find this review from Oh more

65
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,780
than a decade ago now where they posed

66
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,680
this very complicated and almost

67
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,780
legalistic definition of what a gene is

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,950
and I will say that men had mentioned

69
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,180
I've worked with some companies and

70
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:41,919
there's some very good things about that

71
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,240
one of the negative things is you spend

72
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,819
a lot of time talking to lawyers about

73
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,260
IP law and organizational law and you

74
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,759
know who's going to have control of

75
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,009
which part of the company if one of the

76
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,519
partners gets divorced

77
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,989
especially the partners who aren't

78
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,090
married yet so it feels like a lot of

79
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,189
pressure to have to be divorced before

80
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,080
you gonna anyway so I would say that

81
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,599
this is a definition only a lawyer could

82
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,010
be happy with so if you go back to the

83
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,049
origin of the term gene and I didn't

84
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,669
know this until about six months ago uh

85
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,570
it was originally proposed by this

86
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:11,979
Danish geneticist and this is not the

87
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:13,810
original Danish this was a translation

88
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:15,099
to German I know just enough German to

89
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,569
find the right sentence to have pasted

90
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,979
into google translate the word gene is

91
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,659
completely free of any hypothesis it

92
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,639
only expresses the assured fact that at

93
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,919
any rate many characteristics of the

94
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,109
organism are contingent vais special

95
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,458
separable and therefore self-existent

96
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,890
fundamentals that occur in the game

97
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,509
meats so genes are the things in the

98
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:38,349
genome that actually control the

99
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:41,349
characteristics of the organism and I'm

100
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,900
gonna argue yeah not all gene models are

101
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,519
going to correspond to genes so one of

102
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,050
the wonderful things about the grasses

103
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,840
is that they have very conservative

104
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,910
synteny so Sydney is the conservation of

105
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,099
the same genes in the same order so

106
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:55,569
you're seeing here's a graphic from from

107
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,430
Koji which is an online comparative

108
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,739
genomics tool it's run by Eric Lyons at

109
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,650
University of Arizona and each of these

110
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,689
we have a nice gene model comparing a

111
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,770
region in rice in foxtail millet in

112
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:10,930
sorghum and in maize and these are red

113
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,900
orange boxes are regions of homologous

114
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,280
sequence identified blasts and what you

115
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,108
can see is that we have some of the same

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
genes in the same order there's also a

117
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,229
tandem duplication in the sorghum so we

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,259
have two copies of this particular gene

119
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,908
I think this might be phytochrome be I'd

120
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,348
have to check on that

121
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:29,120
so we have these genes that are dream

122
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:31,878
models that are conserved at the same

123
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,788
locations across Halle grasses we also

124
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,259
have lots of gene models that are not

125
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:38,509
conserved at the same locations and

126
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,280
different grasses so these are synthetic

127
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:43,400
ornithologist genes these are non

128
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,318
synthetic genes and the fact that we see

129
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,728
them here but not another species means

130
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,870
that they inserted into their present

131
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:50,628
location in the genome

132
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,598
since the divergence of these different

133
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:55,158
species so if we look at the genes that

134
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:57,079
actually have known characterized

135
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:58,728
functions so some geneticists walk

136
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,800
through a field they said that plant is

137
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:02,060
so interestingly weird I'm going to

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,319
spend those five years of my life

139
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,449
figuring out what is the gene

140
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,330
responsible for why that plant looks

141
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,968
weird those genes are eight times as

142
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:16,339
likely to be these conserved some Tanic

143
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:18,528
genes as the non conserved that the non

144
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:21,318
synthetic genes which are evolutionarily

145
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:23,000
more recent and may or may not have

146
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,650
functions now there's also an argument

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,718
who made that maybe these non setting

148
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:28,068
genes are involved in processes that

149
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:29,658
aren't as immediately obvious as you

150
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,069
walk through the field there was at

151
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:32,629
least one exception where that is the

152
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,550
case which is if you look at disease for

153
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:36,588
systems genes these are almost always

154
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,478
the come from the non satanic fraction

155
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:41,418
of the genome but a lot of these genes

156
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,860
do appear to be sequences with a

157
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:44,810
potential to code for protein or that

158
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,379
actually do code for protein but they're

159
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,430
in search of a functional role still and

160
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,349
there are lots of other ways that you

161
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,250
can see differences between the

162
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:56,360
conserved synthetic genes so they tend

163
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,699
to have very different methylation

164
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,669
profiles the listen chemically conserved

165
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,419
genes the non synthetic genes tend to

166
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:07,250
look a lot like intergenic sequence

167
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:09,049
synthetic genes are expressed at higher

168
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,509
levels this is from a Wally paper a

169
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,610
couple years ago but more interesting to

170
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,718
me if you look at non-synthetic genes

171
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,300
which are expressed

172
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:19,399
they make significant amounts of mRNA

173
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,038
they're much less likely to have that

174
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,158
mRNAs translated into protein than the

175
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:27,348
conserved sent ending genes so if there

176
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,938
this would be very consistent with them

177
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:30,500
having fewer phenotypic consequences

178
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,539
because even though there are ways to

179
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,000
produce unity the consequences without

180
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:36,649
making a protein it's a lot easier to

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,930
have a phenotype if you if you do make a

182
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:41,149
protein

183
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,910
so given a lot of these differences we

184
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:50,529
put together just a very simple PCA

185
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:52,580
analysis so what you see here is a 2d

186
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:55,038
anyway you're seeing essentially a

187
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,258
kernel density plot of both all the

188
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,519
annotated gene models in maize and red

189
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,930
here and these gold standard genes that

190
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,448
have been identified based on a forward

191
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,949
genetic Linotype and this is a subset of

192
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,860
the trait we've put about a dozen traits

193
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,509
into this basic PC based on ones we knew

194
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,629
that there were significant differences

195
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,310
between genes with known phenotypes and

196
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:18,409
those without and we see that there's a

197
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,689
relatively large separation so a lot of

198
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,090
the annotated genes in the maize genome

199
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,379
are concentrated over here they're more

200
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,359
likely to show presence absence

201
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,159
variation they're less likely to be

202
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,270
aesthetically conserved they're less

203
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,669
likely to show evidence of being

204
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:33,589
translated into protein but the genes

205
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:37,879
with no in phenotypes and a cluster over

206
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:39,829
on the side of the distribution so with

207
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,620
this I'm going to give you a few

208
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:45,348
takeaways from this very broad idea

209
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,569
which is that we really do need to

210
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:49,788
remember that gene models are hypotheses

211
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,649
so our gene model is hypothesis that

212
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:53,629
this particular portion of the genome is

213
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,769
actually a gene it actually plays a role

214
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,019
in determining the phenotype of an

215
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,370
organism and I've been very guilty of

216
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,649
this myself that I sort of treat all

217
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,629
gene models as equally likely to cause

218
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,038
phenotypes and that that's not true and

219
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:06,110
we would treat that any other kind of

220
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,788
hypothesis the same way there are some

221
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,979
hypotheses they're more like to be true

222
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:11,689
some that are less likely to be true the

223
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:14,029
ones that you know seem very unexpected

224
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,469
but then I end up being consistent of

225
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:18,679
observation are really really exciting

226
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,389
but we can do a lot to prioritize which

227
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,680
hypotheses that make sense to test which

228
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,050
hypotheses you spend a lot of time

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,150
studying I think we do a lot better job

230
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,259
of this with gene models as well I'm

231
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,829
going to come back to that at the very

232
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,629
end of the talk but now to jump a little

233
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:34,668
bit from very broad how do we identify

234
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:37,189
the genes likely to have any phenotypic

235
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:39,978
consequence to linking specific genes to

236
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,630
specific phenotypes now it was I was

237
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,839
funny I was meeting with some folks and

238
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:45,828
and that's lab yesterday and they had

239
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,370
reconstructed almost this exact same

240
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:50,659
slide I think probably everyone working

241
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,289
in Hydra phenotyping has a version of

242
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,600
this

243
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,939
which is that genotyping has gone from

244
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
extraordinarily expensive to essentially

245
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,500
a trivial part of the cost

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
honestly collecting the samples and

247
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,679
doing the DNA extractions may cost more

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,990
at this point when you factor in the

249
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,449
labor phenotyping on the other hand has

250
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,220
not gotten substantially cheaper

251
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,129
anything that's probably gone up because

252
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,810
the cost of human labour perfectly

253
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:17,899
skilled human labor is going up faster

254
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:19,669
than inflation high throughput

255
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,319
phenotyping is a reaction to the

256
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,269
recognition of this imbalance between

257
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,730
the decreasing cost of genotyping and

258
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,889
the constant or increasing cost of

259
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,240
phenotyping it's also an interesting

260
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,069
concept because it's really there's not

261
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,350
a good definition of phenotyping it's

262
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,570
defined by what it's not so high through

263
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,860
phenotyping is not driving a combine

264
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,080
through the field and getting yield and

265
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,940
it is not sending a bunch of students

266
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,650
into the field with protractors and

267
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,840
rollers and notebooks to write things

268
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,090
down because the students who are

269
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,710
willing to do that we're willing to go

270
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,090
out in a cornfield or a sorghum field in

271
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,950
the middle of summer here in Ithaca and

272
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,480
Nebraska they're a very limited pool I

273
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,440
don't think we can really grow that for

274
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,870
very much they're a non-renewable

275
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,150
resource so if we want to get more data

276
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,440
we need other strategies but as long as

277
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,000
you're not and either of those two

278
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,170
things you can say that you're - you

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,340
know type as long as you're measuring

280
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:09,110
something about plants so it's alright

281
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,330
now we want to invest a lot in hydric

282
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,190
phenotyping it's really not clear what

283
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,740
it is so I'm going to walk you through

284
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,080
the the three three major steps or three

285
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,850
major bottlenecks we found in terms of

286
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,270
actually using this to do something

287
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,269
useful to understand how plants work so

288
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:29,329
we have a little flow chart here yeah

289
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,919
three transitions so growing plants I do

290
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,710
know how to do that I'm not great at it

291
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,750
I kill them occasionally but we can grow

292
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,759
plants and we can collect rates from

293
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,110
them but the first challenge is an

294
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,370
engineering challenge which is once you

295
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,379
have all these plants how do you collect

296
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,669
new and interesting kinds of data from

297
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:46,189
them other than having somebody out

298
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,899
there with a notebook and so this is an

299
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,880
engineering challenge in dementia day

300
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:54,139
I'm fortunate to work with this engineer

301
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:56,269
got University Nebraska so we both have

302
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:58,220
this field based system Frank is a

303
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:01,789
former postdoc and any funds lab who's

304
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,500
now on staff just to keep this field

305
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:04,439
based system up and running where we

306
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,899
have a

307
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,370
a large payload that can move back and

308
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:13,439
forth throughout the field and we can

309
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,820
send up both heavier and more expensive

310
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,140
instruments on this than we could on a

311
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,510
drone because we don't have to worry

312
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,419
about it crashing or veering off or

313
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:24,509
anything like that the other system

314
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,189
which came online about the same time I

315
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,289
was hired at University Nebraska is just

316
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,860
one of these conveyor belt' greenhouses

317
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:33,509
some of you may have visited Danforth or

318
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,070
Pioneer so you've seen these the thing

319
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:36,450
that sets Nebraska's apart from other

320
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,550
people's is not that we can grow more

321
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,040
plants now that we're cheaper widths

322
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:42,599
it's really expensive to run but the

323
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,329
fact that we can grow plants to such a

324
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,340
large size so with this facility can

325
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,020
grow plants up to about 2.3 meters and

326
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,000
still move them through here and have

327
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,539
them imaged with a series of cameras

328
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,980
every day collects weights and the

329
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,990
specific amount of water being used by

330
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,519
each plant in each day so that's enough

331
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,430
to grow grain types or gums all the way

332
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,529
to maturity it's enough to grow some but

333
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:06,359
not all maize inbreds Torture t if you

334
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,850
try and grow maize hybrids on this they

335
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,409
get above that 2.3 meter threshold and

336
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,690
start hitting into the ceiling as they

337
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:14,429
go through and plants toppling over and

338
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,750
that's not very much fun and then it

339
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,069
turns out the greenhouse staff have to D

340
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,419
Tassel your plants so they can still

341
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,310
move through the system at which point I

342
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,909
would argue there's not a lot of useful

343
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:26,279
quantitative data but what you get out

344
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,919
of this is a series of different imaging

345
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,990
types so you see here is one plant being

346
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,519
imaged on one day so we have an RGB

347
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,100
camera the plant is photographed from

348
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,529
different angles around about a 180

349
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,000
degree arc we also have a thermal IR

350
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,429
camera you'll notice that the plant is

351
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,600
about the same color as the background

352
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:43,949
that's because originally these plants

353
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,420
sat in the dark for about 10 minutes

354
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,890
before they were imaged at which point

355
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,110
they equilibria with Airy temperature

356
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,220
we've now fixed this by having a tunnel

357
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,169
where they're under high light and

358
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,700
exposed to the same heat and air

359
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:56,099
conditions is in the greenhouse before

360
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,150
their image fluorescence camera which

361
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,610
I'm not going to talk about very much

362
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,919
today in a hyperspectral camera which I

363
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,779
am so the hype is you know in the human

364
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,309
eye we have three different cones to

365
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,620
receive different wavelengths of light

366
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:10,379
the hyperspectral camera in this case is

367
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,120
perceiving 243 distinct wavelengths of

368
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,200
light so there are lots of colors that

369
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,720
are going to look the same to your eye

370
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,430
or mine that can be distinguished with

371
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,710
this camera

372
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,299
so we have lots and lots of data on I'm

373
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,580
working with great engineers to collect

374
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,559
the data but there's a step that I think

375
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,060
is underappreciated probably you folks

376
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,189
to appreciate this but when you talk to

377
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,919
people outside of the plant biology

378
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,690
community it's very hard to QTL mapping

379
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,309
or gee wasps or anything on a bunch of

380
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,260
pictures I've actually seen people

381
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:38,338
propose ways to do that a little bit but

382
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,319
really what we need is a giant

383
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,089
spreadsheet of numerical measurements of

384
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,850
something we care about the plate about

385
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,470
with the plant and that becomes a

386
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,149
computer vision or a machine learning

387
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,440
challenge how do we go with pictures or

388
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:51,778
a lie to our point clouds or

389
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,540
hyperspectral data cubes and actually

390
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,669
measure things we care about the planet

391
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,049
and there are a lot of approaches to

392
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,088
that but I'm going to tell you about a

393
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:02,429
couple things going on in my lab that I

394
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,500
think are very interesting so one

395
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:06,629
approach is to use neural nets so you

396
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,220
give the computer lots and lots of

397
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:10,200
pictures with known traits and it will

398
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,300
learn from that how to score new

399
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,560
pictures the challenge we have is that

400
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:15,809
even though we have all these hyper

401
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,759
phenotyping facilities actually getting

402
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,009
enough training data to train a neural

403
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,049
map can be challenging so this is work

404
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,909
actually but an undergrad in my lab Tom

405
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:25,829
Hoban who took software that was

406
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:28,469
originally designed to make 3d models of

407
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,528
plants for video games and use this to

408
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,600
create models of corn plants which he

409
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:36,299
concerned into a semi accurate

410
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,920
replication of the same chamber we were

411
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:42,240
collecting real plants from so in a

412
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,219
matter of about eight hours he could

413
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
make about 26,000 of these synthetic

414
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,050
corn plants with different parameters

415
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,550
and known 3d structures we worked out

416
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,958
what it would have cost to grow these on

417
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:55,889
the actual phenotyping facility it was

418
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:58,049
about $80,000 worth of data and we can

419
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,269
use these simulated images to train a

420
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:01,919
computer to predict real images what

421
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:05,069
you're looking at here is prediction of

422
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,479
leaf counting so this is the correlation

423
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,920
if you just show pictures to two

424
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,570
different people and have them count the

425
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,429
number of leaves on the corn plant the

426
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,650
correlation is about point nine so it's

427
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,939
good but it's not perfect that's the

428
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,860
first thing to recognize is we're not

429
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,360
going to get a perfect correlation

430
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,700
because we can't get perfect correlation

431
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,100
between different human beings so our

432
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,990
goal is 0.9 we're not able to get there

433
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,029
what this is showing and I will walk you

434
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,740
through in too much detail is that when

435
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:33,079
data is very scarce so about 300 images

436
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,839
or class or less addy and the synthetic

437
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,389
data actually improves our accuracy over

438
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,910
just using the real images and these are

439
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,080
not particularly accurate

440
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:43,370
representations of a corn plant I mean I

441
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,800
think it's I hope it's recognizably a

442
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,480
corn plant there's clearly a lot more we

443
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,370
could do to make this look more like a

444
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,399
corn plant and so increase the

445
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,959
usefulness of simulated data so that's

446
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,458
that's one approach to teaching

447
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,819
computers how to measure things from

448
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:01,039
images another is those taking advantage

449
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,209
of things like hyperspectral cameras

450
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,009
which perceive the world in very

451
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:07,159
different ways the way a human being

452
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,990
does so you see here is a hyperspectral

453
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,269
data cube from a particular store gun

454
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,919
plant oh this is work from Alejandro

455
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:14,809
Paige's who is a computer science

456
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:16,028
undergraduate in the lab and so what he

457
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:18,229
did is he took a bunch of these images

458
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:20,389
put them up on a web tool called

459
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,639
Zooniverse which is a citizen science

460
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:25,250
tool so a lot of this if you go on the

461
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,659
website it's like game cameras in Africa

462
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,490
and you know how are there zebras the

463
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:30,860
images how many zebra is that sort of

464
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,450
thing but we put up all these sorghum

465
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,310
plants just ask people to say ok where

466
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,709
are the stems where the leaves where the

467
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,389
panels and miraculously some people were

468
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:42,379
willing to do that even given the option

469
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:44,000
looking cool zebras and dress so we very

470
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,070
rapidly got a training dataset of about

471
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,919
8,000 data points each of which is one

472
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,220
pixel within each pixel we have 243

473
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,389
different wavelengths intensities

474
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,778
looking at that we can develop very

475
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:59,750
separate reflectance parameters or what

476
00:16:56,778 --> 00:17:03,528
these different classes and pixels look

477
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,088
like leaf the stalk now as a human being

478
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:07,519
it's very easy to look at a standard

479
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:09,318
text picture of a sorghum plant and tell

480
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,240
me where is the belief where's the stem

481
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,920
where's the pentacle it turned out to be

482
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,720
a very challenging problem for the

483
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,209
computer to do that from the RGB image

484
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,179
but with the hyperspectral data computer

485
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,100
can do a very good job of separating

486
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,900
these different classes one of the

487
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,338
things I think is actually cool is it

488
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,720
does make mistakes and you can see what

489
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:29,629
it's doing is it thinks that the mid

490
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,400
ribs of the sorghum leaves our stem so

491
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,390
you have this dense lignified tissue and

492
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,559
that's that's getting misclassified so

493
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,250
even the mistakes are things that make

494
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:43,678
sense I'm gonna come back to that Oh

495
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,490
so the nice thing about being able to

496
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,600
separate out the different parts of the

497
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,720
sorghum plant is we can start to measure

498
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,509
traits that make more sense biologically

499
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,860
so one of the first things whenever our

500
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,779
students join the lab is they learn how

501
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,759
to segment out just this is an RGB

502
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,470
photos of corn of sorghum plants and

503
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,450
we've this is actually the same sort of

504
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,669
plant over time and the image is

505
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,900
segmented so we have the plant pixels

506
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,759
circled in red you can see there's some

507
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,409
mistakes down here but it's possible to

508
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,558
measure the whole height of the plant

509
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:15,120
what you will note is that the height of

510
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,359
the whole plant goes up and then goes

511
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,339
down because as the flag leaf first

512
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,509
comes up it's pointing straight up and

513
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:24,119
then as the panicle starts to emerge

514
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:27,839
that angle of that leaf changes so we

515
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:31,259
get this sort of bump in the analysis by

516
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,849
having this organ aware segmentation we

517
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:36,179
can extend instead look at the same

518
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:38,279
chord same sorghum plant and look at

519
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,769
just the height of the stammen panicle

520
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,629
and so we get a much more consistent

521
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:44,639
growth curve that is reflected doing a

522
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,130
better job of reflecting how the plant

523
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,419
is growing then looking at the the total

524
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,179
height which is influenced just by this

525
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,179
leaf sort of flapping up and down as the

526
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,150
plant grows and this is important

527
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,190
because when you look at a lot of traits

528
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,500
that are measured hyperspectral are from

529
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,080
high people phenotyping data you'll get

530
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,779
a something like this so these are two

531
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,038
traits just plant height and biomass and

532
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,950
here we've got ground truth which was

533
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:13,288
measured again by students with rollers

534
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,288
and notebooks and scales and this is the

535
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:18,750
estimated measurements for both of these

536
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,970
from the images and these correlations

537
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,650
look pretty good this is a question that

538
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,319
my student Jakaya thought to ask though

539
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,730
is the error that's left here is it

540
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,779
random if it's random error we'll just

541
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,210
throw more plants that it will get

542
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:33,149
really good accurate estimates or is it

543
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,620
systematic and what he found was that it

544
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,809
was systematic so there were certain

545
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,668
genotypes that were systematically

546
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,500
having their biomass under predicted and

547
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,630
others that were systematically having

548
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,788
their biomass over predicted so about

549
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,830
half of that variation is heritable it's

550
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:48,269
controlled by genetics so there are

551
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:50,939
differences in the architecture of the

552
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:52,319
plant that are producing systematic

553
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,140
errors in our measurements so if we were

554
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,210
using this to

555
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,070
you say train of genomic prediction

556
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,240
model for biomass we wouldn't just be

557
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:01,909
predicting biomass we'd also be

558
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,009
predicting the phenotypes that lead to

559
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,710
errors in measurement of biomass from -

560
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:10,129
phenotyping data so it is important if

561
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,450
we can get getting more accuracy is very

562
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,360
important not just because it's more

563
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,580
accuracy - so removing systematic biases

564
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,269
in the way that the data is being

565
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:22,159
collected so now to the fun bit so we've

566
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,990
gone from growing plants we've developed

567
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,720
robots and sensors and things to collect

568
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,819
data and computer algorithms to turn all

569
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,029
that data into giant spreadsheets full

570
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:33,829
of numbers but I really am a biologist

571
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,480
at heart I would like to actually you

572
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:39,250
know map some genes or find something

573
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,360
and there are some interesting

574
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,829
quantitative genetics challenges

575
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,919
opportunities whatever you want to call

576
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:48,889
them that occur because of the types of

577
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,350
data that are produced by a community I

578
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,570
think so this is the same sort implanted

579
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:56,179
last section you can see the two

580
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:58,220
different measurements of height you can

581
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,100
also see the the heritability of height

582
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,140
as measured by these two methods both

583
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:06,709
from the individual data points and also

584
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,840
fitting a non parametric curve to each

585
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,670
of the heights and you can see that

586
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,009
generally the heritability from the

587
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,170
fitted curve is a little bit higher than

588
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,879
from the raw data it's not a perfect

589
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,259
pattern and we think this is because

590
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,030
we're able to borrow data from adjacent

591
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:23,569
peda points to get a more accurate

592
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:26,899
measurement so another student my lab

593
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:29,299
Chen yung yau is working on using this

594
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,400
to do mapping in the sorghum Association

595
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,289
panel which is a population about 400

596
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,759
sorghum wines most of which are

597
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:36,859
conversion lines so they were collected

598
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,829
from all over the world cross to us germ

599
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:41,389
plasm to degress both photo period and

600
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,279
sensitivity dreams will actually flower

601
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,009
if we grow them in the summer and

602
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,869
Nebraska and also working genes so that

603
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:51,890
they will be plants like this and not

604
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:53,479
plants taller than the ceiling now if

605
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,450
you grow this population in the field

606
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,180
and you're interested in plant height

607
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,130
it's very easy to map a couple two of

608
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,789
the at least two maybe three of the

609
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:06,320
large effect genes that are involved in

610
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,000
sargam height because there are still

611
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,669
some very very

612
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,309
also our compliance in our population

613
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,140
now I mentioned in the greenhouse we can

614
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:18,169
only grow up plants to about 2.3 meters

615
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,820
so we take out the extremely tall plants

616
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,150
that are producing a strong signal and

617
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:25,759
use the same data we now are not able to

618
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,990
map any of the these dwarfing genes we

619
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,420
know they're real you know where they

620
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:34,120
are you know we can't find them with the

621
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:36,920
population we're gonna work with so you

622
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:39,019
see here is our the high curves a large

623
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,850
number of the different sorghum plants

624
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,349
collected from this experiment in the

625
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:44,990
greenhouse whistles days after planting

626
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:47,559
this is the height in centimeters and

627
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,609
you can see that when the plant gets

628
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,409
ready to have the pentacle emerge you

629
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:53,179
have this large bolting response which

630
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,190
happens at different times for different

631
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,570
plants and it just looks very very messy

632
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,580
and it's not quite clear what to do with

633
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:04,939
it this is actually pearl millet not

634
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:06,619
sorghum because it looks cooler but

635
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,180
you're seeing images I think these were

636
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,459
collected every two days of this promo

637
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,049
plant throughout its lifecycle as a

638
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,430
human being it's very easy to look at

639
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:14,809
this plant and see oh look there's this

640
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,850
transition it goes from just making

641
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,759
leaves now it has some panicles at the

642
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:20,869
top and then it goes into senescence you

643
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,150
will also notice that there's this

644
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:25,009
person who comes in was collecting was

645
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,930
doing some sort of maintenance during

646
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:29,569
one of the days while we were like the

647
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:32,539
images again this is a thing that is

648
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:34,730
easy for a human to do but genuine was

649
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:37,430
able to train a neural net using less

650
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,930
than a thousand images to get relatively

651
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,180
good accuracy at identifying when is

652
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,310
this transition point from reproductive

653
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,240
development to reap vegetative

654
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:49,009
development to reproductive development

655
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,599
again is that even the errors are the

656
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,000
kinds of errors that human might make so

657
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,519
the transition point we're targeting is

658
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,829
when does the pentacle first become

659
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:59,779
visible so the computer there's a little

660
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:01,549
bit of Pinnacle shooting out here the

661
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,639
computer misclassified this is not

662
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:06,049
flowering this plant is about to flower

663
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,240
the panicles right here in the stem

664
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:10,220
you've got the flag leaf up here and the

665
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,079
computer not confused inside this was a

666
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,370
farm plant so these are a lot of the

667
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,129
same kinds of mistakes that I would

668
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:19,939
expect particularly a board human being

669
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,470
to make if I was you know hiring high

670
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,980
school students or people online or

671
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,159
something

672
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,659
these classifications so once we have

673
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,090
this classification data instead of

674
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:30,500
using planting as our benchmark for

675
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,230
comparing everything we can shift the

676
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,359
data around two days before a pentacle

677
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,788
immersions and we start to get much more

678
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,699
similar shapes of growth what you'll

679
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:42,980
notice is now we have different

680
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,950
different time ranges measured for each

681
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,890
plant

682
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,990
and with this the first thing we can do

683
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,230
is just scan through and do genome-wide

684
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:58,420
Association study or height on every

685
00:24:53,230 --> 00:25:01,150
different day see okay so this is Z

686
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,160
dwarf - and group won't work or if to

687
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,210
work for which i think is not actually

688
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,430
work for I think that's labeled show up

689
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,430
and then later on in development we go

690
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,640
so that's animated it's a little hard to

691
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,190
follow so here's another way of

692
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,770
displaying the same data so you see here

693
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,080
on the y-axis is the ten chromosomes of

694
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,849
sorghum and going across we've

695
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,549
highlighted genomic fins when there's at

696
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:34,519
least one significant step in that day

697
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:36,589
of the analysis and there are several

698
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,599
relatively long Peaks that correspond to

699
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:41,839
some of the genes that we would expect

700
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,969
to be able to map either if we benchmark

701
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,909
on days after planting or working the

702
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,579
benchmark and days at emergence we're

703
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,880
writing lots and lots of us here and if

704
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:54,500
I tell you where the known genes are we

705
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,940
can find them but it would be it's hard

706
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,140
for me to look at this and say what

707
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,660
conference okay we really have

708
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,050
identified we want identify there's a

709
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,610
lot of noise also down in the analysis

710
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:07,399
so this is where we started talking to

711
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:10,849
another statistician at the University

712
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,400
of Nebraska you Honshu who was a recent

713
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:15,139
hire and his expertise is on working

714
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,180
with nonparametric regression and the

715
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,200
curves you can generate from that and

716
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,980
actually me although how do you break

717
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,750
that down into how different individuals

718
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,360
vary with respect to those those curves

719
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,250
so you see here in gray are all the

720
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:32,500
curves for all of the sorghum plants in

721
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:35,660
our population as well as both the

722
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,089
empirical estimate of sort of the center

723
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,400
value or the average pattern and the

724
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:42,859
estimated pattern from his nonparametric

725
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,050
regression and he can then do a

726
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,759
functional principal component analysis

727
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:49,369
to identify what are the major

728
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,539
components of variation which is what

729
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:54,169
you see on the other side of this slide

730
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:55,639
so pc1 which explains about two-thirds

731
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:00,080
of the variance is essentially just

732
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,759
taller versus shorter so I never really

733
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,679
understand what what determines what's

734
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,349
plus and what's - but you can see if you

735
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,029
have a more negative value for PC one

736
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:09,529
the plant is taller essentially

737
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:12,589
throughout development you have a more

738
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:14,930
positive value at shorter PC two on the

739
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:17,480
other hand is essentially a trade off so

740
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,650
you have and this explains another like

741
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,210
twenty to thirty percent I'm gonna have

742
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,660
it on all later slide where you're

743
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:26,000
taller earlier and shorter later so now

744
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,220
for every plant we can describe the

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,779
curb as a combination of four principle

746
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,470
components these to explain most of the

747
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,940
variation and we can do G wasjust using

748
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,309
these principle components that describe

749
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,190
the shape of the curve as our our

750
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:43,849
metrics instead and when we do that we

751
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:47,029
get some very clean signals so okay 68%

752
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:49,909
of 20 years work one dwarf two are both

753
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:53,450
identified the principal component one

754
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,470
and Dwarf three or component two now

755
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,910
what's interesting about this is you

756
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,769
know a little bit about the biology of

757
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,380
how these different genes affects plant

758
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:02,329
height so dwarf one dwarf to affect

759
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,670
essentially all the internodes were

760
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:06,889
three is affecting the lower internodes

761
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,960
but not the elongation of the peduncle

762
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,140
so the the stand that leads up to the

763
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,299
panicle so what you'd expect here is

764
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,000
this would have a substantial effect on

765
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,059
height before flower but then you

766
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,509
wouldn't can they run em again a

767
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:25,039
backwards anyway I'm not gonna dig

768
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,980
myself a deeper hole in this slide what

769
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,389
I'm gonna say is that the effect height

770
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,430
differently and it's consistent with the

771
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,130
patterns with the PCs and I will defer

772
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:41,299
to qionghua my student on why that all

773
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:43,130
makes sense all right so the yeah we can

774
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:45,259
we can integrate data across multiple

775
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:47,330
time points and we're able to recover

776
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:48,950
statistical power to identify genes that

777
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:52,159
we know are there because we can

778
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:55,910
identify them in a larger population by

779
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,259
integrating this time series data people

780
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,960
have done this previously using

781
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,369
parametric models where you decide okay

782
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,100
plants are going to grow and show a log

783
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:05,119
my logarithmic pattern of grow what we

784
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,529
found here was not actually that

785
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,239
different from logarithmic patterns but

786
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:10,369
what I like about it is it doesn't force

787
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,690
that assumption so a lot of the really

788
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:13,939
interesting stuff in biology is they're

789
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,320
really weird unexpected stuff and non

790
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,470
parametric curve fitting can capture

791
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:22,240
weird unexpected stuff whereas fitting

792
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,240
the sigmoidal curves cannot

793
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:29,139
Otto Tate of genetics point I want to

794
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:31,089
talk about is the challenge of high

795
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,070
dimensional or nearly high dimensional

796
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:34,569
data so technically I'm told by my

797
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:36,279
status different collaborators I cannot

798
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:37,809
call it high dimensional until I've

799
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:40,599
measured more phenotypes than the number

800
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:43,869
of individuals in my population which is

801
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:45,519
a high bar so we're this here I'm going

802
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,379
to talk about having hundreds of

803
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,930
phenotypes whether or not it is a truly

804
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,360
high dimensional data set now that

805
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,799
because of both types of you know typing

806
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,349
and large collaborative projects

807
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,539
becoming more and more common to have

808
00:29:56,349 --> 00:30:00,849
many many traits towards the same

809
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,859
population in plant biology we also see

810
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:05,649
this from medical data record mining in

811
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:07,599
humans and also from large numbers of

812
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,880
molecular phenotypes so looking at

813
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,319
hundreds of metabolites or thousands of

814
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,710
gene expression levels across all

815
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,659
populations and so this presents a

816
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,279
challenge of multiple testing because

817
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,710
the conventional approach to doing this

818
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:24,069
would be to do set to G wasps for every

819
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:28,150
single trait and this becomes

820
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:31,720
combinatorially or common becomes a lot

821
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,519
of tests very very fast so a student my

822
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,670
lab jukai lang working with a

823
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,190
statistician at Iowa State was

824
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:42,370
interested in trying some other methods

825
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:44,880
to deal with this data and the data set

826
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:49,539
we used was was from here at Cornell

827
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,370
with the Amaze 282 Association panel and

828
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,259
so you can see that there were a large

829
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:54,369
numbers of traits measured and many of

830
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:56,470
those traits were scored enough to

831
00:30:54,369 --> 00:31:00,399
sixteen different environments so we had

832
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:02,309
a whole total of 260 trade data sets to

833
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,460
work with

834
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:07,659
and the challenge of this so if we do G

835
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,509
Waze for any one trait so what you're

836
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,600
seeing here is G us for a single snip in

837
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:15,430
a single gene and instead of having all

838
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,169
the steps in the x-axis each of these

839
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,180
represents the significance for one of

840
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,519
the traits in the data set so if I run

841
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:25,299
any as US for one of these these are

842
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,009
flowering time traits a lot of them are

843
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:28,869
statistically significant on their own

844
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,490
if we take into account all the

845
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:31,779
hypotheses that are being tested across

846
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:36,759
all of the phenotypes

847
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:38,200
none of them are significant anymore so

848
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:40,629
we would like to be able to do some sort

849
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,710
of a more integrated test to utilize the

850
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,510
data from all these traits together

851
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,900
because clearly if you're detecting the

852
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:49,119
signal and many many different

853
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,410
measurements of the the phenotype that

854
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,519
should we should be able to sort of

855
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:56,440
combine and leverage that signal see the

856
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,960
approach used here is first to identify

857
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,630
sets of gene sets of steps within a gene

858
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,910
to cluster and then select a single

859
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,800
representative snip for groups of

860
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:10,450
markers that are in high LD with each

861
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:12,430
other the first half of this model is

862
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,759
just looking at multiple snips but a

863
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,410
single phenotype and is fitting a very

864
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,180
complicated just to model which I will

865
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,570
be upfront is essentially a black box to

866
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:23,950
me my status to sickle collaborator and

867
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:29,289
then test that the results that come out

868
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:32,680
make sense go through a stepwise

869
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:35,109
selection procedure to select subsets of

870
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,690
all the the phenotypes that show a

871
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:40,240
significant signal for that gene do a

872
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,240
new comparison between our initial model

873
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,490
which is attempting to explain the

874
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,819
variation for all the snips within that

875
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:51,460
gene we've kept after filtering using

876
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:54,730
both principal components population

877
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,950
structure variation as well as a

878
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:01,329
selected subset of the traits from the

879
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,710
whole new hundred sixteen set I'll say

880
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:03,789
so there's a preprint that will go into

881
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,680
the methodology here in a lot more

882
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:09,569
detail we also have the R code that was

883
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,570
used up on on github

884
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:15,750
stepwise selection procedure worse there

885
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,740
are essentially really large numbers of

886
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,109
hypotheses that are being tested so the

887
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,589
p-value distribution we see is quite

888
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:24,939
skewed relative to what we would expect

889
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:26,709
from the number of tests where we're

890
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,630
actually running in terms instead of

891
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,490
implicitly running its weight of doing a

892
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,040
lot of permutation testing just to

893
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,509
determine what what is the distribution

894
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,250
of p-values we would expect to see

895
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:38,079
because they end up being very extreme

896
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,960
anyway and from this we can establish

897
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:45,309
what we hope is an accurate false

898
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,430
discovery rate cut off and doing this

899
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:51,099
takes quite a bit of time we had to make

900
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,539
even making some some compromises and so

901
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:55,569
there are things we know we could be

902
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:57,250
doing better that we're not because it

903
00:33:55,569 --> 00:34:00,279
still takes about seven years of CPU

904
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:05,289
time to analyze 32,000 gene models a

905
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:07,389
maze and then we get results others also

906
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:10,360
look like this so I already talked you

907
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,820
through on the top we have each

908
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,340
phenotype scored here along the the

909
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,890
x-axis on the top you have the p-values

910
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:20,230
for the individual phenotypes on the

911
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,059
second side you have either the selected

912
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,130
phenotypes for non selected phenotypes

913
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:26,949
or this gene and then an overall

914
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,630
significance score for the gene as a

915
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,509
whole whether we see a significant so XI

916
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:35,380
a ssin between these snips in this gene

917
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:39,250
and all the phenotypes measured or this

918
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:41,320
population as I think probably came

919
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,360
across the way I explain this a lot of

920
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,240
the stats I don't understand the details

921
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,980
up so I want to see whether or not the

922
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,429
associations that are identified by this

923
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,409
model make any sense at all fortunately

924
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,460
we have a couple of ways to do that

925
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:59,170
so the first is looking at overlap

926
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,980
between the genes that are identified in

927
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:05,860
this population with this set of data in

928
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,809
this method and genes that were

929
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,910
identified in different populations

930
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:12,039
using different methods so here we're

931
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:15,670
comparing the genes that were identified

932
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:17,920
by a number of different models in the

933
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:20,289
282 population two genes that were

934
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,150
identified in the nested Association

935
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:24,969
mapping population which shares some of

936
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,889
the same haplotypes there's a larger and

937
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:28,000
with different structure now I talked to

938
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,559
Ed yesterday and there may be some

939
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,090
problems with this analysis and we're

940
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,840
gonna work on a way to validate it

941
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,670
but in principle anyway if we have more

942
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,960
accuracy we should see more overlap

943
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,210
between the genes we identify our

944
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,369
population and the genes identified in a

945
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,349
different population for some of the

946
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:48,220
same phenotypes then the genes

947
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:50,440
identified by conventional algorithms so

948
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,879
you see here we have some data on

949
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,380
version 2 of the maze genome and some

950
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,030
one version 4 so we're constrained to

951
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,440
only the genes that actually have

952
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,200
one-to-one correspondence between the

953
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,179
two versions of the genome about 14

954
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,559
percent of those genes were identified

955
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:05,019
as linked to phenotypes the nest of

956
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,549
Association mapping population then we

957
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,809
can look at the subsets of genes

958
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,910
identified by different she wants

959
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:12,489
algorithms and they are enriched so

960
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,409
they're more like the genes identified

961
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:16,059
in the Association the 282 Association

962
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:18,429
populations are more likely to also been

963
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:20,049
identified ministers Association mapping

964
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:23,500
population so that's good that's what we

965
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:25,330
expected and then this genome-wide

966
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,639
phenome wine analysis that my students

967
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:28,989
if I came up with we see substantially

968
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:33,210
higher overlap but is significantly

969
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:35,679
higher than the overlaps scene-by-scene

970
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,019
with any of the conventional G wass

971
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,118
methods this is the internal control

972
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:43,929
here so this is multiple step a single

973
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:46,300
trait so it is utilizing multiple

974
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:49,000
markers within the gene but not trying

975
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:54,460
to do the selection picking a subset of

976
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,929
traits to test together we can also look

977
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,139
at the kinds of genes that are being

978
00:36:55,929 --> 00:37:01,389
identified by the the GP loss model

979
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:03,670
compared to conventional G loss

980
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:06,539
oh you're seeing here is a go enrichment

981
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,550
analysis so we went identifying

982
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:13,779
essentially the same number of genes we

983
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:16,660
see much more enrichment of a wide range

984
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:19,570
of go term enrichment and purification

985
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:22,239
of go terms in the GPS genes that

986
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,430
relative to genes identified by G wasps

987
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,368
on the same underlying phenotypic and

988
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:28,539
genotypic data so I'm not gonna go into

989
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,608
this too much but I'm just going to

990
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:32,108
assert that this demonstrates that we at

991
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:33,880
least are identifying a less random

992
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:36,569
subset of the genome which could be a

993
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,570
good or a bad thing

994
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,590
we can also look at the specific

995
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:43,320
phenotypes that are being identified as

996
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,940
associated with individual genes that

997
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,090
have been characterized through for

998
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,530
genetics so this is an example of

999
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:53,850
anterior one which is classical mutants

1000
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:56,160
cloned back in 95 95 so we know a lot

1001
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:58,110
about phenotypes that the mutants of

1002
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,670
this gene exhibit we also know the

1003
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,490
phenotypes that were identified is

1004
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:05,280
associated with it based on the the GP

1005
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:09,929
wasps model and a lot of these match up

1006
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,260
not all of them so that gives us some

1007
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:14,789
sort of qualitative degree of confidence

1008
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,680
the thing that I think is is most

1009
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:18,480
exciting about the genes identified by

1010
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,079
this method though it's not any of these

1011
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,490
but the the feature the ways that they

1012
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
are different from the average gene in

1013
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:28,799
the genome so we're gonna compare here

1014
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,320
we have all the genes our conventional G

1015
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,390
wasps GP wants genes and other control

1016
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,340
which are a set of these classical

1017
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:36,779
mutants which again are those genes that

1018
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,940
somebody walked through a field and said

1019
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:43,050
that phenotype is so interesting I need

1020
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,539
to clone it so you can see that if we

1021
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,220
just look at a having an averaged

1022
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,130
expression level higher than a single FP

1023
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,529
can all of these sets are much more

1024
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,170
likely to be expressed at at levels

1025
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:58,650
above background than the overall set of

1026
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:01,380
gene models in the genome if we look at

1027
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,210
kak F so a measure of how effectively

1028
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,160
purifying selection is operating on

1029
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,510
these you only do this for the subset of

1030
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:10,710
genes that are actually conserved in

1031
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:12,870
sorting we see that both the classical

1032
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,190
mutants and the GPS genes have a shift a

1033
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:16,949
statistically significant shift to

1034
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,269
distribution towards lower KS ratios

1035
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:20,849
which indicates they're subject to

1036
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:22,889
stronger purifying selection and the

1037
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:24,210
average gene in the genome ah there a

1038
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:27,539
couple of other markers I told you about

1039
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,960
synthetic conservation which is a almost

1040
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:32,279
all of the classical mutants are these

1041
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,809
synthetically conserved genes and this

1042
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,710
particular set about ninety four of them

1043
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:38,730
we also see a substantial enrichment

1044
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,699
both for genes identified by

1045
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,820
conventional G wasps and for IGP wasps

1046
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:46,439
relative to the background set and

1047
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,580
conversely amazed there are a lot of

1048
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,070
genes to exhibit presence absence

1049
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,670
variations so they're in b73 se but

1050
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,130
they're

1051
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:56,670
absent from other genetic backgrounds

1052
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:58,740
and we see that I was quite common for

1053
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,809
the genes that as a whole it is much

1054
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:03,029
rarer for genes identified through

1055
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:05,400
quantitative genetics and GP wasps is

1056
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:10,260
closer to the really low level that we

1057
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,789
see for classical mutants so any

1058
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,650
quantitative genetics approach to

1059
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:15,809
identifying genes that are associated in

1060
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,460
phenotype identifies genes that look

1061
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:19,170
more like classical mutants than the

1062
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,690
overall population of gene models and

1063
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,280
the approach that GK is using seems to

1064
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,309
identify a population looks even more

1065
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,900
like those classical mutants than

1066
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:32,519
conventional Jie wasps so to summarize

1067
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,990
we identify we're identifying this

1068
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,369
population of genes that we think are

1069
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:37,529
associated with phenotypic variation

1070
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,119
there more broadly expressed there more

1071
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,430
conserved at the same positions across

1072
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,230
species less likely to exhibit

1073
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:45,089
presence/absence variation they also to

1074
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,940
be longer genes which we see also for

1075
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,620
the classical mutants and so we can take

1076
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,360
this figure that I showed you at the

1077
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,309
beginning of the presentation and we can

1078
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,050
calculate essentially a gene function

1079
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:58,199
soy which is just the inverse of that

1080
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,460
principal component one so a score over

1081
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,769
here means you look more like a

1082
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,809
classical mutant score over here means

1083
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:06,030
you look more alike the gene models that

1084
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:07,619
don't look like classical music see the

1085
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,840
distribution of all the gene models

1086
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,239
their genome has a large peak over here

1087
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,910
and both the classical mutants and the

1088
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,879
GPS genes exhibit similar distributions

1089
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:19,109
shifted towards this end of the spectrum

1090
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,309
so the beginning of this talk I told you

1091
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,039
that I think we can do a bit much better

1092
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:25,139
job of deciding which gene models

1093
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,360
represent hypotheses that likely are

1094
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:29,819
valid that they likely do explain

1095
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,470
something about how the genome

1096
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:36,180
determines the characteristics of an

1097
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:38,099
organism in which which gene models are

1098
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,349
much less likely to play a significant

1099
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,480
role in determining phenotype as a whole

1100
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:43,920
and while I have some students who are

1101
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,000
working on doing much better jobs of

1102
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,010
this prediction than what I have right

1103
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,929
now I hope this is at least convinced

1104
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,550
you that such a thing is possible that

1105
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:53,009
we really can look at gene models to do

1106
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,600
a better job of saying you know these

1107
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,460
probably are interesting and worthy a

1108
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,869
lot of a lot more study these probably

1109
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,320
we don't want to burnout grad students

1110
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:04,259
trying to find a phenotype so with that

1111
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,210
I would like to thank my my wonderful

1112
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,030
my colleagues both engineering

1113
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:11,099
statistics and biology and all of you

1114
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,550
for your attention here today I'd be

1115
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:19,378
happy to take any questions

1116
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:19,379
[Applause]

1117
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:44,490
they've already funded price that's a

1118
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,920
very good question

1119
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:51,419
um so that mean I don't have a perfect

1120
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,250
answer I would say because we're using

1121
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,280
primarily genes that were identified

1122
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,900
prior to 2011 I think the benefit of

1123
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,190
being cloned in rice which much smaller

1124
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,280
because a lot of that happened before we

1125
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:04,170
had a maize genome to me compared to if

1126
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,369
we it would be really interesting I've

1127
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,550
got a student working on getting the

1128
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:11,940
2011 to 2019 genes I would predict we'd

1129
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,350
see a bigger effect of already having a

1130
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,269
characterized function in rice or

1131
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:17,269
another grass in that later so you could

1132
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:47,039
compile a species genes that are highly

1133
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:49,739
expressed also actively expressed and so

1134
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:57,449
in this model which tries to predict

1135
00:43:49,739 --> 00:44:01,319
gene studies of a range of these that's

1136
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:05,009
a very good question let me go yeah so

1137
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,650
the question was that you observed a lot

1138
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,960
of correlation over already between the

1139
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,369
the average level of expression the

1140
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,090
breadth of expression across many

1141
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:17,010
different tissues the KS which

1142
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,210
is not in this particular model cuz only

1143
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,210
we only had it for some technically

1144
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:29,280
conserved genes and there was another

1145
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:31,079
one oh okay so we certainly see yeah

1146
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,610
that's one of the things I like about

1147
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,279
being able to visualize the data this

1148
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:39,630
way is we do see a lot of these do seem

1149
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:46,380
to show up similarly when we project

1150
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:48,329
them into the PCA space I think that

1151
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,920
there are some genes though we see that

1152
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:53,069
you have very high expression that are

1153
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,050
not evolutionarily conserved and so

1154
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,150
being able to pull out some of them in

1155
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,760
the categories that are exceptions to

1156
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,710
the overall trend and look at those

1157
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,230
would be be very interesting in terms of

1158
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,309
figuring out whether the reason a lot of

1159
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,960
these are showing up is that they're all

1160
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:08,940
correlated say with expression or

1161
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,750
whether they have separate predictive

1162
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,010
power I haven't done that yet I would be

1163
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:27,690
interested to find out the answer and

1164
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:30,330
share it with you so that's a good

1165
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,400
question so we can we can configure how

1166
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:34,559
flexible it's going to be with

1167
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,750
individual data points one of the things

1168
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,900
I really like about it though is it does

1169
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,670
tolerate uneven data so if we have dense

1170
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,769
sampling in some parts and much less

1171
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,619
dense in other parts we're still able to

1172
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:48,659
fit reasonably good curves one of the

1173
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,889
points I didn't talk about a lot with

1174
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:51,539
this is the way that the images are

1175
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,159
collected we actually can grow twice as

1176
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:55,079
many plants as it can be photographed in

1177
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,519
a day so the only reason we're able to

1178
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:57,900
make this comparison is because we're

1179
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,750
able to use the nonparametric regression

1180
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,730
to fill in the values so that we can

1181
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:09,750
look at the whole population at the same

1182
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:11,960
time yes as far as the county leaves the

1183
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:14,429
sort of plants and simulated images

1184
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,550
what's them assuming you have a computer

1185
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:20,279
during corn and then just we're just

1186
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:23,400
taking more pictures of the same more

1187
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,370
peeps of the same plants because both

1188
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,750
leads is I mean maybe County leaves is

1189
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:31,259
simple enough for not overfitting

1190
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:35,550
but isolated I would like just take more

1191
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:57,630
pictures with the same training course

1192
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:58,200
so there are a number vague mentation

1193
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,910
approaches

1194
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:01,789
you can use with real images you can you

1195
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:05,069
know mirror the image and then do a

1196
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:06,210
adding noise I think that we would

1197
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,070
rapidly hit a point of diminishing

1198
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,480
returns in terms of the number of

1199
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:12,329
different angles you can photograph the

1200
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,849
plant from and still get noticeably

1201
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,320
different images so what I like about

1202
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:18,150
the simulated approach and I haven't

1203
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,070
shown that this is the case is that in

1204
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,380
principle we're simpler sampling a

1205
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,539
really wide parameter space in terms of

1206
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,490
what a corn plant looks like and in some

1207
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:27,989
ways that's a problem so I'm not gonna

1208
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:29,489
jump all the way back to that slide but

1209
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:31,348
one of the issues we had is we don't

1210
00:47:29,489 --> 00:47:33,449
actually have an alternating pilot taxi

1211
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,190
in the simulated plants the guy who made

1212
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:38,868
the the corn plant model for video games

1213
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:41,820
I don't think realize that that was did

1214
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:45,329
so we we could do more work to converge

1215
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,410
on a biologic and form 3d model the

1216
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,450
bigger challenge

1217
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:51,179
and it's not such an issue for relief

1218
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:52,529
counting is you also need the you don't

1219
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:54,779
just need the photos you need the ground

1220
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:57,839
truth and so for a lot of sort of

1221
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,280
complex structural traits it can be very

1222
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,559
challenging to collect the ground truth

1223
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,010
from large numbers of real plants you

1224
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:06,599
have the full 3d model of the corn plant

1225
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:08,550
you already know all the ground truth so

1226
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,750
it's not just collecting the images but

1227
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:22,500
collecting the ground truth where you

1228
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:24,480
save effort so there are about a hundred

1229
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,460
genes and so these are ones that were

1230
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,650
identified first by phenotype and then

1231
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:31,769
somebody actually cloned it that way

1232
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:33,000
rather than either just a statistical

1233
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:35,009
association between the gene and

1234
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,300
phenotype or reverse genetics if

1235
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,099
somebody said hey this gene looks

1236
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,780
interesting let's knock it out and then

1237
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:41,780
try really hard to find a phenotype

1238
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,679
you've been concentrating a lot on the

1239
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,869
morphological tannin times yes and maybe

1240
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,519
a bunch of this within pertains to those

1241
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:54,140
because historically that's what people

1242
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:55,039
mapped and those in the genes that work

1243
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,659
alone first

1244
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,429
what about when you start looking at

1245
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:01,219
physiological traits and things that

1246
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:05,149
aren't most logically observable in this

1247
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:08,389
way wouldn't that shift the entire gene

1248
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:10,400
space that you're working with that is a

1249
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:12,019
good question so as I mentioned

1250
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,849
certainly for the disease resistance

1251
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:16,219
genes those behaved so differently from

1252
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:18,108
everything else in terms of the stuff

1253
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:22,219
involved in physiology or biochemistry

1254
00:49:18,108 --> 00:49:24,409
that isn't reflected in morphology I'm

1255
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:25,909
not sure I could make a good prediction

1256
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:29,629
right now but the great thing is we're

1257
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:31,909
getting those datasets you know more and

1258
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,260
more every day so I'm so very soon I'm

1259
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:34,670
confident I would have an answer on

1260
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,410
whether they would behave the same as

1261
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,849
the Norfolk genes controlling

1262
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:59,769
morphological traits or if they show

1263
00:49:37,849 --> 00:50:01,789
very different trying to think about the

1264
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:03,500
transcription factors that do such

1265
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:07,909
different things in different species

1266
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:10,400
and I mean my take-home is a lot of what

1267
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:12,079
is regulated at least the things that

1268
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,139
we've been interested in are regulated

1269
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,108
by transcription factors and they're

1270
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:21,500
there Abe expressed often at very low

1271
00:50:18,108 --> 00:50:25,819
levels and be very specific times and

1272
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,440
tissues and see they affect the kinds of

1273
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,410
phenotypes were interested in but the

1274
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,329
same transcription factor does

1275
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:34,519
completely opposite things or different

1276
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:37,630
things in different species so that's

1277
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:41,269
why I'm you know I'm just trying to I

1278
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:45,050
think that's a reach into the gene space

1279
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:48,619
that I'm yeah I'm interested in that I

1280
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:53,300
don't know of this I yeah I would agree

1281
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:55,340
I don't we it's not answered but the

1282
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,980
datasets are out there so I need to get

1283
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:01,690
you an answer

1284
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:04,480
thank you yeah quick question yeah

1285
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:07,030
I really like your models that separate

1286
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,869
leaves from stocks from vehicles those

1287
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:13,690
results look really nice I'm wondering

1288
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:16,809
whether the weights for those models as

1289
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:20,108
is generalize well to other grasses that

1290
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:21,759
you have similar data sets for I'm I'm

1291
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:23,679
actually that's one of the things I'm

1292
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,770
sure Young's to-do list is to run this

1293
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,118
we have cro millet maize data and see

1294
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:30,338
whether it's translatable or if we need

1295
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,500
a new training set for each species that

1296
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:35,619
we work on they do work very well across

1297
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,269
the 400 sorghum genotypes so at least

1298
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:50,950
it's not genotype specific which is

1299
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:54,670
always the this has been a production of

1300
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:57,598
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

1301
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,599
edu
