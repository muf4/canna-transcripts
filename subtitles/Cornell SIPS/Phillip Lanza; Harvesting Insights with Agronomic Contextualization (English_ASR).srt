1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,960
University uh my name is Philip Lanza I

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,320
work with Louie um my

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,560
presentation is called harvesting

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,560
insights with agronomic

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,399
contextualization I like to thank chat

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,518
GPT for coming up with the clever title

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,399
for me again um so my presentation is

9
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:26,640
going to be in this format I'm talk

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,278
about why I'm doing what I'm doing then

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,920
go over my objectives briefly and then

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,119
take a few questions at the end if we

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,600
have

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,640
time um so as we know you know we have a

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
sustainability problem with large scale

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,159
agriculture we need to continue to

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,439
increase output to feed the world but

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,159
they're starting to have more and more

19
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:51,599
bad effects from over feralization you

20
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,799
know pesticide usage um pollution from

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,520
Machinery fossil fuel usage all of that

22
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,718
so it's a challenging problem um

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,559
thankfully a lot of people are studying

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,359
this we're working on improving things

25
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,359
and and maintaining sustainable

26
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,118
intensification so we don't have like

27
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,959
ecological and environmental disaster um

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,159
the thing that's kind of a barrier is

29
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,959
it's often difficult to get Farmers to

30
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,080
adopt practices you know so it's

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,078
challenging because there's a lot of

32
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,599
complexity in these systems and if

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,000
something goes out to a farmer and it

34
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,158
doesn't work then it kind of erods trust

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,719
between researchers and farmers and you

36
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,719
know that they'll be less likely to

37
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,640
adopt things so it's important important

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,158
as researchers that whatever we do like

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,960
the bucket says we do it

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,280
right so one way to address this is

41
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,359
doing on Farm experimentation this is

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,040
doing experiments on farms uh we answer

43
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,959
questions in production environments um

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,759
two main types are scientist Le which

45
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,839
make things kind of like this where you

46
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,718
know it's complete random randomized

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,240
block design or strip trials um

48
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,718
researchers design these so they're

49
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,599
replicated usually they evaluate the

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,879
dependent variable given whatever this

51
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:06,280
looks like a nitrogen trial usually

52
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,958
they're smaller scale because the

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,719
complexity of the

54
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,239
design doesn't allow them to be done by

55
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,439
like a farmer you know no Fields look

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,599
like this in actual production the good

57
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,800
thing is they produce clean data um it's

58
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,518
easier to evaluate and we can really

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,959
determine say like causality and things

60
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,120
from this the bad thing is they're

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,800
really done in production conditions so

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
it limits their ability to be

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,040
implemented you know know and work

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,599
exactly as we think another type is

65
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,919
farmered where Farmers routinely do

66
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,439
experiments on their fields um you know

67
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,839
whether doing like uh variety trial or

68
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,598
different nitrogen rates different

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,519
application timings these are the things

70
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,560
that we've been working with where you

71
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,680
know we don't impose any experimental

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,080
design the farmers do what they do

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,040
natively now the challenge with this if

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,560
you look at the top one this farmer did

75
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,359
the control around the border of their

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,479
field field which if you know Agronomy

77
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,239
is not a standard condition so basically

78
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,280
it wasn't an effective control but other

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,280
ones do more sophisticated designs like

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,799
this one at the bottom where they did

81
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,719
paired strip trials with a control

82
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,439
between you know and they really

83
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,359
accounted for their data well um so you

84
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,919
know the challenge with this is often

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,879
they aren't replicated you know a farmer

86
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,280
might do it on one maybe two Fields um

87
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,719
so you have maybe a strip to evaluate

88
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,438
other things are there are a lot of

89
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,598
confounding factors we have to account

90
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,479
for

91
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:33,719
um good and bad is that they're large

92
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,280
scale you know they cover the whole

93
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,919
field but that's a lot of data to work

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,239
with a lot of complexity to work with

95
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,919
and they're often subject to incomplete

96
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,480
or um inconsistent data a lot of farmers

97
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,280
say record their management data in a

98
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,280
notebook you know so there's no easy way

99
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,919
to get that if they even record it

100
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,479
sometimes like yield monitors break so

101
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,719
we don't get yield for the year

102
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,560
especially um the really good thing is

103
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,639
they're done in real world production

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,199
conditions these are things that the

105
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,000
farmers are interested in learning

106
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,318
they're more likely to adopt these

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,598
practices and the the findings the

108
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:08,798
strong point of this is they're

109
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,438
immediately applicable because they're

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,799
done on the farmer field so the

111
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,919
conditions are the conditions you know

112
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
so anything you find will probably work

113
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,439
and and be

114
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,358
applicable now one way to address this

115
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,079
as Lou said is is we're trying to apply

116
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,879
observational research methods to

117
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:29,918
agronomic systems um these are commonly

118
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,800
done in medicine social sciences and are

119
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,959
good for studying complexity also where

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
you can't necessarily impose a treatment

121
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,680
you know like you can't infect someone

122
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,600
with covid and say oh what what happens

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,478
you know you have to kind of use

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,639
existing data and

125
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,319
see you know what you can gather from it

126
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
so kind of data mining data driven

127
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,079
methods work really well um I like doing

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,520
data driven methods I don't like doing

129
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,839
regular statistics so great for me and

130
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,639
um you know they require context which

131
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,679
are kind of objective data to

132
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
characterize what's going on so for

133
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,319
purposes of agronomic observational

134
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,120
research in my projects I Define this as

135
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,680
the biophysical and environmental Co

136
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,240
variants present in the experimental

137
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,918
area so like soil properties weather

138
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,360
terrain weather all these good things um

139
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,719
One Challenge though is how do we

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,879
collect these data at the scale

141
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,560
necessary to do large experiments and

142
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,759
really leverage all the on Farm

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,680
experimentation going on one way is to

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,439
go out in the field and pull samples you

145
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
know we we do this it provides really

146
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,038
good data here we are taking so samples

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,560
and microbiological samples for a you

148
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:41,279
know biological nitrogen product um the

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,959
challenge with this is it's a lot of

150
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,478
Labor you know you can't send a 100

151
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,799
people out into a field to pull these

152
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,478
you have to pay to process them so that

153
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,879
limits it scale and then fields are

154
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,959
really big you know this one's over a

155
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,879
kilometer so to pull enough samples at a

156
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,198
density sufficient to fully characterize

157
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,639
it it isn't really

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,639
feasible um thankfully there are other

159
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,720
sources of context data that are online

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,759
um you know weather data Precision

161
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,680
agricultural sensor data like yield Maps

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,280
uh as applied maps all these things we

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,038
can use environmental data like from

164
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,038
different weather data products uh

165
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,038
biophysical data like soil properties

166
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,719
terrain data um and this is easier to

167
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,478
use but the challenge is it's still very

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,639
labor intensive because they're in

169
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:28,159
different sources different formats it's

170
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,879
hard to kind of integrate them and get

171
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,240
these raw data to produce

172
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,159
knowledge you know things that we can

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,720
act upon um so it also limits its

174
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,280
feasibility for a large scale

175
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,680
application which you know is better

176
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,918
than go and pull 100,000 samples but

177
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,319
still not awesome so we get to my

178
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,318
dissertation which is developing novel

179
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
tools supporting research in agronomic

180
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,919
systems with a focus on integrating

181
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,079
biophysical and environmental

182
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,240
contextualization data in on form

183
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,918
research that's a lot to say but

184
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,560
basically I want to make it easy for

185
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,359
people to use this context data to apply

186
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,839
obervational research techniques so that

187
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,400
way we can quickly come up with some

188
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,079
solutions to the challenges that we're

189
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,279
facing and you know sustainably produce

190
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,159
food to feed the world without

191
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,159
destroying the environment and the

192
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,000
ecology so here are my objectives the

193
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,319
first is to develop a tool I call geod

194
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,759
Dart to facilitate retrieval of this

195
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,360
cont contextualization data um the

196
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,560
second is to develop a system using

197
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,199
these data to identify areas of

198
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,478
anomalous crop response within fields

199
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,080
and then lastly demonstrate using output

200
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,159
from the stad system that these

201
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,878
techniques work you know and and kind of

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,319
do a proof of concept saying we can do

203
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,439
this we can go for with this and apply

204
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,199
it to other types of

205
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,680
experimentation I'm going to talk about

206
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,520
my first objective now it is developing

207
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,598
the geospatial data retrieval tool I

208
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,839
call geod Dart um it fa facilitates

209
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,878
retrieving contextualization data so you

210
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,719
know one challenge a lot of people can

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,400
do scripting to get things but it ends

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,479
up you know in a lot of different places

213
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,679
people need to learn to program to kind

214
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,158
of do this it's often challenging and

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,439
then you have to go find the script to

216
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,079
get this and things like that so I

217
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,360
wanted to make a centralized way to do

218
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,598
this and also allow people who can't

219
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,960
code to do this so I designed a website

220
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,000
it's the web-based user interface that's

221
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,198
pretty easy to use that then hits a

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
python backend to retrieve the data do

223
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,280
geospatial processing things like that

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,759
um quickly you know the data products

225
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,519
I'm pulling now are all from Google

226
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,158
Earth engine which is like a huge

227
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,479
repository of all kind of spatial data

228
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,240
sets um I'm pulling things that are

229
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,639
relevant to agronomic systems such as

230
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,320
weather via grimit which is a Daily 4

231
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:47,199
kilometer resolution data set Polaris

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,600
soil properties um after I did this I

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,800
found out there's some limitations with

234
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,080
it so I'm planning to switch to the

235
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:55,159
soless soil data set which is supposed

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,399
to be a good bit better um I'm pulling

237
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,719
hourly weather from rtma if you need

238
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,958
really fine temporal resolution you us

239
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,800
drought monitor which is 2 kilm spatial

240
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,599
drought intensity severity data set um

241
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,278
Optical remote sensing from Sentinel 2

242
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,399
and um we can calculate things like

243
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,759
vegetation indices to characterize crop

244
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,159
response and other things um and then

245
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,039
elevation data such as like uh you know

246
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,519
slope elevation aspect I'm going to

247
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,759
calculate things like terrain ruggedness

248
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,720
index and all this is from the USGS is

249
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,240
3D elevation program um one meter is a

250
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,240
lot better for infield usage but there

251
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,959
are some strips where it's Miss 10 meter

252
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,919
covers the whole country so where one

253
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:38,278
meter is not available I'm using 10

254
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,278
meter and here's a quick overview of the

255
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,439
user interface for the website this is

256
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,000
what people will be interacting with I

257
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,800
wanted to make it really easy to use um

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,759
the website also supports uh user

259
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,120
profiles so you have to authenticate you

260
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,639
can granularly say you can access this

261
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,078
but not this you can assign users to rol

262
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,919
say like you know an internal lab versus

263
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,919
once I make this public say like Farmers

264
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,559
so we can control what people access to

265
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,799
and and deliver relevant information

266
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,439
while protecting data privacy um so once

267
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:12,199
someone's logged in you pick what

268
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,440
product you want um you can pick active

269
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,360
only so when I implement the

270
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,959
functionality for Solus I'm going to

271
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,320
disable Polaris but if somebody wants

272
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,759
that they can uncheck that box and get

273
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,519
Polaris you pick what bands you want

274
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,360
from the data it all comes in as a

275
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,560
multiband roster so you say Okay I want

276
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,480
precipitation whatever whatever and

277
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,319
here's a completed Farm you can add

278
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,079
things like file prefixes to help

279
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,160
organize your data when it comes in also

280
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,879
I'm storing metadata about this in a

281
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,159
database so you can put form name field

282
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,278
name project name and then depending on

283
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,319
what product you pick you enter relevant

284
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,559
search criteria such as a start date end

285
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,200
date you can paste in your area of

286
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,319
Interest like a field boundary you can

287
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,839
also upload a file like a shape file

288
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,839
geop package geojson um lots of other

289
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,399
formats and then the system will extract

290
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,120
that for you

291
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,278
then you click submit download request

292
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,959
what that does is hits the python

293
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,679
backend which initiates the data

294
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,359
transfer and collection from Google

295
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,039
Earth engine if you want to clip it to

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,120
the area of Interest it'll do that basic

297
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,000
geospatial processing you can um

298
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,600
generate like vegetation indices so that

299
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,278
way if you want ndvi you can pull that

300
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
and this the overview of the system I

301
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,078
could talk a lot more about this but I

302
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
have 25

303
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,559
minutes okay um how I'm going to

304
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,680
evaluate this is basically if it works

305
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,638
designed um you know so all are all the

306
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,278
requested data products retrieved for

307
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,320
the correct ranges areas are the

308
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,278
metadata store correctly is it um

309
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,959
download L sent one thing I forgot to

310
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,480
say is right now if you're in our lab

311
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,919
we're going to store the data and index

312
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,600
in the database so we can do spatial

313
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,078
searches metadata searches to retrieve

314
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,079
it if you're an external user you're

315
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,919
going to get a link to download the data

316
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,919
and it'll stay there for 48 hours after

317
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,000
which it's deleted to conserve resources

318
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:05,319
but you know I want to make sure that

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,639
works um and we've used this in a 23

320
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,200
field year experiment to pull the data

321
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,600
everything works since then I've added a

322
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,720
couple of additional features I need to

323
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
go through and test but the plan is to

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,440
you know run everything again for like

325
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,159
20 fields for a growing season check

326
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,839
everything make sure it works if that's

327
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,799
good this objective is

328
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,800
good um next objective is to develop a

329
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,838
spatial temporal anomaly detection

330
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,958
system I call stads and that's to detect

331
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,000
areas of anomalous crop response at

332
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,159
subfield

333
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,159
scales um and why this is important is

334
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,240
because if you're designing an

335
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,639
experiment or interpreting results and

336
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,839
say you have a strip where it's like a

337
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,360
really anomalously bad area and you

338
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,880
aren't aware of that it can like skew

339
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,639
your results um so very briefly how this

340
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,838
system works in detecting the anomalies

341
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,680
is I have a group of field boundaries uh

342
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,800
that some crop scouting firms were kind

343
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,759
of enough to provide me with um we

344
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,278
filter using the USDA crop land data

345
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,198
layer to find right now corn fields if I

346
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,919
can't get enough data for The Scouting

347
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:07,799
to evaluate this I'm going to expand to

348
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,278
like soybean and wheat maybe um and then

349
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,359
from there we have the grain Fields I'm

350
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:15,838
clustering based upon um soil weather

351
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,639
and terrain characteristics so you know

352
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,560
I want to compare anomalies from things

353
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,120
that are roughly similar to where you

354
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:28,759
know it's accurate um from there I'm

355
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,600
generating um a trend surface using a

356
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,319
combination of random forest and then I

357
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,680
do regression cre on the residuals to

358
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,360
improve the accuracy of the trend

359
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:40,120
surface for indvi and how I'm doing that

360
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,560
I'm pulling each one of these pointing

361
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,799
like you can see one of all of these

362
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,679
data products at you know a 30 meter

363
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,159
grid Point by Point by Point um right

364
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,479
now I'm doing 100 meter but I'm going to

365
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,759
reduce it to um increase special

366
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,360
resolution and making a trend surface

367
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,639
from there where then you know it

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
predicts what it should be given ABCD

369
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,000
you know and then from there I'm

370
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,519
checking the actual ndvi and calculating

371
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,159
a residual so any residuals that are

372
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,360
Beyond a certain threshold right now I'm

373
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:12,240
using 1.5 standard deviations plus or

374
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,639
minus um will be identified as anomalous

375
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,079
you know and if it's below what it

376
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,360
should be that's negative deviant if

377
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,879
it's above it's positive deviant um you

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,199
know things I need to figure out are

379
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,958
like evaluate other Trend surface

380
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,958
production methods so I'm going to do

381
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,758
like a generalized additive model with

382
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,239
regression cing and I may do a it's

383
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,759
called B is

384
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,600
basian additive regression trees which

385
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,440
is kind of like a random Forest that

386
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
includes like confidence intervals which

387
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,680
would produce kind of more like

388
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,399
certainty um so I need to evaluate that

389
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,198
figure out makes the most accurate Trend

390
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,159
surfaces and then play with the

391
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,240
threshold to to find tune the system to

392
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,838
identify things better

393
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,079
um so that's how that works here's some

394
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,000
example output of the Prototype I have

395
00:14:54,078 --> 00:15:00,439
now um red areas were identified as

396
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,078
being anomalously low indvi versus what

397
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,959
the prediction surface said this is that

398
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,479
30 m spatial resolution you can kind of

399
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,559
see the square size um and this is a

400
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,399
good balance between computational

401
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:15,159
efficiency and allowing the farmers to

402
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,919
manage it effectively um so these two

403
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,319
and green were kind of good they're

404
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,439
within the field you know that'll be

405
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
something we would Scout and evaluate

406
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,639
but I need to fine-tune the system

407
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,039
because things like this you know the

408
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,079
building is going to have a ninous low

409
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,639
crop response because it's a building so

410
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,479
I need to be able to detect these

411
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,879
objects in fields and say this isn't a

412
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,680
crop you know exclude this and another

413
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,958
thing which is going to be easier to fix

414
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,758
is um this strip here I think it's due

415
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,239
to mixed pixel effect because the border

416
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,360
of the field always isn't exactly

417
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,720
aligned with the field boundaries so

418
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,199
we're getting some kind of mixed effect

419
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,759
from the headline and the field which is

420
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,958
then negatively scoo that down um so

421
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,240
what I'm going to do for this is just

422
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,119
buffer in by like 30 m to to make sure

423
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,318
that all of the pixels we evaluate are

424
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,839
like pure pixels for for the

425
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:05,958
field and then the tempor aspect of this

426
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,120
system is for every overpass where we

427
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:14,198
can get indvi um I'm going to do the

428
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,679
same process and then uniquely identify

429
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,679
each anomaly So based upon whether it's

430
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,479
new stable growing shrinking by looking

431
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,838
at the area things like ratio of

432
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,159
perimeter to area we can tell if the

433
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,440
shapes changing um that'll give us

434
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,679
insights as to the cause you know and

435
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,240
this isn't causality where we can say

436
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,838
this is is definitively the cause but

437
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,159
based upon agronomic knowledge we can

438
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,440
kind of say well if this anomaly is

439
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,120
persistent it's probably something

440
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,759
that's persistent like a soil property

441
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,039
or you know just a block of concrete in

442
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,079
the field that we can't detect from

443
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,360
remote sensing whereas if it's small and

444
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,000
starts to grow it's probably something

445
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,680
like a pest disease or if it's transient

446
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,120
you know when it's dry and then it rains

447
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,439
and it goes away it's probably like the

448
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,759
soil moisture capacity is reduced there

449
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,199
for some reason um so using this I think

450
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,159
we can then Target more like focused

451
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,599
research and scouting to to Really

452
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,360
determine causality but in the short

453
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
term we can say okay well this is an

454
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,759
anomalous area we're not going to put

455
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,000
our trial right here or like we can

456
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,240
account for some uncertainty in our

457
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,199
result interpretation because this

458
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,519
included an anomalous

459
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,038
area so how am I going to evaluate this

460
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,720
this uh summer partnering with some crop

461
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,439
scouting firms right now Western New

462
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,880
York crop Management Associates maybe a

463
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,279
couple others um the plan is to have

464
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,160
them go Scout 100 areas ident identified

465
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,519
as being an anomalous and just look and

466
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,798
see you know like look at the plant see

467
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,759
if they're like really worse or better

468
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,960
and then look for things like um pest

469
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,240
disease weed pressure lodging nutrient

470
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,919
status saw moisture notable Weeds now

471
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,960
saw moisture you know when they go

472
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,360
through the fields they go kind of

473
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,480
quickly so it'll be like is it standing

474
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,399
water is it muddy is it very dry is it

475
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,400
you know

476
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,919
anything really visible we're not

477
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
pulling like a probe or anything um and

478
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,000
then just do like you know paired

479
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,440
sampling 10 meters in the anomaly 10

480
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,359
meters outside of the anomaly so we can

481
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,200
kind of comp compare and see well you

482
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,119
know the field should be more or less

483
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,038
the same in in this small area we can

484
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,519
see if this is like an actual anomaly or

485
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,519
just an artifact of the system and if

486
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,000
you know I think if I get over like 70%

487
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,240
I'll say this was successful the system

488
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,038
was able to detect things and I think as

489
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,919
I go through and fine-tune it detection

490
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,759
resolution will kind of

491
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,919
increase so the last objective is to

492
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,798
demonstrate that you know using these

493
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,240
observational techniques aided by the

494
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,960
tools I've developed can improve um kind

495
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,440
of result interpretation by doing a

496
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,558
comparative analysis of correlation

497
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,200
between soil health and yield which is a

498
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,399
commonly accepted thing we know this is

499
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,840
true um Harold and Jose were kind enough

500
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,880
to let me use their awesome production

501
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,119
environment soil Health Data which they

502
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,440
go and Pull and get like a lot of soil

503
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,119
properties and come up with a soil

504
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,279
Health score um we're going to get the

505
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,558
yield data from cooperator farmer and

506
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,720
and agronomic firms right now we have a

507
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,879
um an overlap of about 161 Fields where

508
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
they have data and we have the

509
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,600
boundaries I'm hoping to increase that a

510
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,480
bit but even if we get like half I I

511
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,959
think that'll be a good representative

512
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,038
sample to show the utility of this um

513
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,600
and then it's kind of a simple analysis

514
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,359
but there aren't as many confounding

515
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,439
factors so we can show really like using

516
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,038
this context will increase strength of

517
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,000
result interpretation account for some

518
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,919
certainty and um going to do this with

519
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,960
her without anomalies the

520
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,080
experimental design I'm going to segment

521
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,558
all of the fields into four groups uh

522
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,359
one will be all the fields with and

523
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:40,558
without anomaly so just like raw data

524
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,199
like we would do without any context um

525
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,119
next will be the ones where the Stat

526
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,558
system didn't identify any anomalous

527
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:50,279
areas then Fields with lower percentage

528
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:54,038
of anomalous areas and larger um how I'm

529
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,038
going to determine this excuse

530
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,080
me is I'm going to do a grid search and

531
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,559
just eval valate what percentage of

532
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,918
anomalous area has strongest correlation

533
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,359
um this provides kind of a more granular

534
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,880
evaluation than doing something like

535
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,519
quantiles where I don't know how much

536
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,720
area is going to be anomalous you know I

537
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,639
I don't know how that's going to fall so

538
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,759
this I think lets me get a better uh

539
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,600
idea of what what I should use and then

540
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,839
evaluate the correlation strength as

541
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,279
calculated by Pearson's R between the

542
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,798
soil Health score and the yield per acre

543
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,960
and my thoughts and and this will be

544
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,279
hopefully it works out that the fields

545
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,360
with no anomalies will have a stronger

546
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,440
correlation versus those with smaller

547
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,918
versus larger you know and then the ones

548
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,279
all Fields should fall somewhere in

549
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,960
there so my evaluation is like okay if

550
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,440
if the fields with no anomalies have a

551
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,640
strong correlation then we're accounting

552
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,880
for this it's strengthening result

553
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,280
interpretation and we're good and also

554
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,440
you know I want to demonstrate that we

555
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,279
can do this at scale and people can use

556
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,600
this to do other things um such as like

557
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,038
you know variety trials you can you can

558
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,558
use this context to do that you can um

559
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:06,200
plan Scout CR crop scouting operations

560
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:07,918
you can um do lots of other good things

561
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,640
any anything that's spatial I think can

562
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,880
benefit from this

563
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,120
technology so in closing I forgot to

564
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,159
reset the time I don't know how much

565
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,158
time I have left but i' like to thank

566
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,880
everyone here for com and watch me on

567
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,080
you know the wrong day and a different

568
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,799
time especially you know Louie and my

committee David Diana for helping me

570
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,839
really like strengthen my scientific

571
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
knowledge uh my family for moving across

572
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,359
the country with me so I could do this

573
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,599
um everyone in Farmers data lab Alex

574
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,000
Katie om car you know it's been awesome

575

working all with all of you uh everybody

576
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,119
in Dan's lab for giving me baked goods

577
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,679
and smiles and encouraging me and then

578
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,719
uh Western New York crop manager

579
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,600
Associates especially Avery de garer for

580
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,960
working with me to get data and give me

581
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,359
feedback on my products um New York so

582
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,679
Health lab Harold Joseph Ceda for

583
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,158
funding some work uh people in computer

584
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,120
science for helping me figure some stuff

585
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,200
out everybody on 10th for blad Bradfield

586
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,798
from like bringing light to Bradfield

587
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,840
and all of you for coming watching me so

588
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,158
thanks and um I don't know how much time

589
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,879
I have left but I'll take a few

590
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,480
questions

591
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,240
now we have some couple of minutes

592
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,960
question yeah what do you think you're

593
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,759
missing in the data stack that you're

594
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
developing what are the limits of the

595
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,119
data products that you have and what do

596
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,240
you wish you had I wish I had like more

597
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,199
consistent management data you know like

598
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,120
that's that's hugely important

599
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,798
uh we're working on another way to

600
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,000
collect that kind of like a web form but

601
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,839
you know that that's I'd say hugely

602
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,519
impactful on what happens also like

603
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:44,959
variety and things like that so yeah got

604
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,200
an idea for aw yeah thank

605
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,400
you H great talk I was wondering with

606
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:56,720
the geod dart um as you're developing

607
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:58,679
this or used by these Farmers um what is

608
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,558
your process for making sure that what

609
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,120
you're developing will be useful for

610
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,240
them how are you engaging them in

611
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,639
dialogue about the product that you're

612
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,120
developing sure sure right now it's it's

613
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,278
tail it for researchers um you know

614
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,158
future work what I want to do is put

615
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:14,839
like an analytics engine on top of it so

616
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,000
they can say Okay I want to get crop

617
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,918
response um driving you know driving

618
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,440
development for researchers I'm a

619
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
researcher I know it works we've talked

620
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,919
to people in the lab and try to make it

621
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,038
easy for us but also over the past

622
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,759
couple of years we've gone out and

623
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,319
interviewed Farmers about what's of

624
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,640
products they use how do they get their

625
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,918
data what would kind of ease their pain

626
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,520
point so kind of iners communication um

627
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,480
I think maybe a more formalized study of

628
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,158
like use case analysis might be useful

629
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,798
um certainly if I want to commercialize

630
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,960
it but right now you know at least to

631
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:52,200
get started I want to make it for

632
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,200
researchers so we can kind of use this

633
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,798
easier all right our speaker thanks

634
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:08,558
this has been a production of Cornell
