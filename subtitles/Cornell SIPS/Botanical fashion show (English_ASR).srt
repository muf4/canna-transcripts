martial arts horticulture class

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,560
three students have made designs to show

7
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,839
you all today sheila gordon um jasmine

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,518
laquisier

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,678
and eva johnson

10
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,038
right now i have my grass skirt on i'm

11
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,000
lulu rios

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,880
and

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,439
this

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,960
part of this skirt is designed with

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,599
peniceptium

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
foxtail so it's an annual form of this

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,280
grass and then i've alternated the

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
colors i think these are the less ripe

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
ones and these are the more ripe ones

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,558
and so that gives a design

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,558
and then the background of this skirt is

22
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,558
detailed with protonia

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,198
the leaves of this grass and then on the

24
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,839
back

25
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:59,839
have

26
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
creating a whimsical look perfect for a

27
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,280
wedding garden if you look closely you

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
might notice a hint of blue which is

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
noticeable on the top such a dress must

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
have something blue

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
finding a dress with seams and bonding

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,840
in place that can support the weight and

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
layer sewn onto the dress base of the

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,040
challenge jasmine recalled a blue polka

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
dot dress last morning high school

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,159
perfect to work from

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
once the bodice was feathered with

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
leaves and moss sewn in jasmine

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
carefully positioned the double layer of

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,840
the tulle wrapped around the waist

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,679
covered the skirt it was time to

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
determine how best to dust the whimsical

43
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,400
layer in the scratch jacket weave and

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,400
tie it with the acid wire

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
finally the tool was cut into strips and

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
fed through opening the shoes and head

47
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,439
piece

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,239
which complement the dress

49
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,239
for a total look

50
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,199
um

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
if you look closely at the back of the

52
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,399
head piece you can notice the dream

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
catching

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
yeah

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,239
the dream catcher is made of laguarus

56
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,639
ovitus which is full thread cred ammobia

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,640
and white feathers

58
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,639
were intended to seem as though they

59
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,798
were containing the laborer it is almost

60
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,359
as if the plants themselves were

61
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,599
constructing the worker so dependent are

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
the laborers on these crops

63
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,518
for a day's wage that unfair labeled

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,040
practices within the workplace can

65
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,039
remain unchallenged for some time

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,599
the bag is covered with arbor vieta

67
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,000
leaves and insinuated with countless and

68
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,000
plants five

69
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,359
and now we're gonna have our guests we

70
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,519
have nina basic from the art health

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,199
department and she works with men's

72
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,478
garden which is where i got all of the

73
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
flowers from

74
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,199
um

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
perspective

76
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,839
well i'm very

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,478
enjoy the fact that you use grasses

78
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,599
which might be seem to be gradual but

79
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,000
quite

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,840
tough yeah right and so

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,079
that's quite a big thing and i like the

82
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,119
whole composition and then oakley is

83
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,120
your idea yeah they're

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,000
yes so we took oak leaves and i didn't

85
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,000
glitch it myself i ordered them before

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
yeah okay and then there's progress

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,038
there's more of those as well

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,038
yeah yeah

89
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,038
issues

90
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,560
my name is charlotte and we have

91
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,319
charlotte from the textile department so

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,478
clothing

93
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,519
well i like i like the composition very

94
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,800
much

95
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,079
as nina said it's a complete look

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,919
you have the

97
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,478
headwear you have the dress you have the

98
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,599
footwear so it all goes together nicely

99
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,038
and i think

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,000
the wedding theme

101
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,318
it has a fresh look it has almost a hint

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,560
of innocence and hope for the future so

103
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
it's really a perfect combination

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,038
and then your colors you have a hint of

105
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,079
green in your headdress and then the

106
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,038
green

107
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,918
the gradation of dreams is really nice

108
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,519
i like the mix of textures so the the

109
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,839
elf flakes are really terrific for

110
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,639
bringing out the the texture and then

111
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,638
that

112
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,600
next to the the green that you wasted

113
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
especially so it's a really fun outfit

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,639
yeah and

115
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,758
you're just going to have to

116
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,000
take this

117
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,639
to uh greater heights we should have had

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,120
the tv folks here

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,120
in the video

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,519
very nicely done thank you

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,680
and i was wondering if anyone in the

122
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,519
class had any questions um the oakley's

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,478
at the top you turn them

124
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
like

125
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,478
they're like vertically placed yeah

126
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,519
they're upright and i sewed around like

127
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,719
the main

128
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,680
vein

129
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
um

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,439
and yeah so i just did like like three

131
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,758
little

132
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,759
sewing sutures i guess down the vein and

133
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,038
then these are already prepared

134
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,639
yeah because they're dried they like

135
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,478
naturally kind of like curled up a

136
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,120
little bit

137
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,560
yeah which material you find is

138
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,918
difficult to work with um the grass for

139
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
sure because

140
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,879
um

141
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
i originally wanted to just glue the

142
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,879
grass onto the dress

143
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,519
um but this grass is a lot thicker than

144
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,159
the one that i planned or wanted to use

145
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,758
so what i ended up having to do was like

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,240
sew it on to like an

147
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
individual piece of wire and like wrap

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,160
like bunches of them and then sew it

149
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,080
onto the dress so it was a lot more

150
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
work than just like

151
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,038
like hot gluing it on

152
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,038
so this was harder

153
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,478
um i

154
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,240
have so much leftover material from like

155
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:56,079
what i ordered and last night i

156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,280
um

157
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,359
wanted to make one because one of my

158
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,439
best friends made one um from my

159
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,759
leftover material and so i looked up how

160
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,279
to do it and i decided that it looked

161
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,598
great with the dress and it's all the

162
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,598
same theme so i had it in the back

163
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,120
um were there grasses like already

164
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,519
curled like that no they were straight

165
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,160
they're like one of the straight like

166
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,120
bushes of um

167
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
grass

168
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
out there and uh

169
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,360
i actually got injured

170
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,878
like two weeks ago and couldn't like

171
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,639
walk and so i needed like space in my

172
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,158
room so i couldn't correctly dry them

173
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,158
flat on the floor so they ended up

174
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,038
drying in a bucket and kind of got the

175
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,278
curly look which i ended up liking

176
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,278
so

177
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,759
um it

178
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,959
took me the entire fall break and then

179
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,120
like

180
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,639
at least two to three hours a day since

181
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
then so

182
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,159
yeah

183
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,519
is is this permanent i mean once you

184
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,838
take it off are things going to start

185
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
falling off it's pretty permanent i put

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,440
it on like three different times and

187
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,399
like i think this is what's gonna end up

188
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
staying

189
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,039
and like

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
yeah everything's pretty much preserved

191
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,278
so

192
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,080
yeah i think it'll stay for a while

193
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,080
well we're final round

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
i thought it was so interesting that you

195
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:37,759
chose to do a costume

196
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,159
workers who were being exploited

197
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,360
i honestly don't remember why i want to

198
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,360
do that

199
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,159
i think i was walking by the banana

200
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
plant and welcome me the welcome center

201
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,958
and wow those leaves are really big and

202
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
that'd be really cool to work with but

203
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,239
next time i make the dress i have plants

204
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,240
and we'll make it out of leaves though

205
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,000
so it was a good idea for

206
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
coming out either exploited worker from

207
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,039
um

208
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,639
actually it was interesting working with

209
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,879
the materials because these tobacco

210
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,759
leaves came from some of some family

211
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,720
friends

212
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,639
in like haiti in the dominican republic

213
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
and so i used to live in the dominican

214
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,519
republic and i just was talking to my

215
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,040
friend one day and she was like oh what

216
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,879
are you up to and i was like i have this

217
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,240
really cool horticultural project she's

218
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,679
like you know like we still have an

219
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
implementation can you just shift you up

220
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,679
and he

221
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,159
was like that'd be great like are they

222
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,838
gonna be dry by the time they get here

223
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,600
and she's like no no they stayed like

224
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
pretty pliable for a couple weeks so

225
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,759
it's like awesome send them up and they

226
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,879
were very pliable and i was just telling

227
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,559
them that i was trying this on this

228
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,000
morning like making sure i could like

229
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,759
bend my arms and things like that and

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,679
things were good and then i brought it

231
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,679
out into the windsor this morning

232
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,439
so so we have cotton and tobacco

233
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,079
there are coffee beans on the head wrap

234
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,480
yeah and the banana leaves

235
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,439
so actually the head wrap is the bin

236
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
that we made

237
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,559
so

238
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,759
it has natural plants

239
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,000
as i know it was

240
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,600
really a very unusual

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
theme and

242
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
execution

243
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,720
i find it interesting too that you're

244
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,159
looking at cultural and social and

245
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,639
political

246
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,879
emphasis with your costume and in fact

247
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,879
closing through the ages has done that a

248
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,278
bit you know

249
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,278
in the days when women wanted to

250
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,838
present themselves as stronger figures

251
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,679
and they put shoulder pads in their

252
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,680
suits and i'm sure you all have heard

253
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,599
that before but but you know in order to

254
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,199
make a statement that women were strong

255
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,040
and they could handle these jobs like

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
men and so forth and

257
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,399
so i think it's interesting that you're

258
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
sort of carrying on that tradition i'm

259
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,639
definitely not an artist so i i wanted

260
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,919
to i started with research and i kind of

261
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
wanted to just go with something that i

262
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,240
can learn

263
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,679
you've also done a really good job of

264
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:07,199
creating the look of 18th century uh

265
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,958
costumes like it it came out looking

266
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,959
ragtag you know like

267
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,559
i don't know they were like i said the

268
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,159
leaves stretched across the whole dress

269
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,039
and like like everything was covered

270
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,360
before

271
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,120
so it looked a little fresher and now

272
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,680
that it's dried i mean like you can see

273
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
the cloth but if i had put more on it

274
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,519
like knowing that they were going to dry

275
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
up in a day then it would be interesting

276
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,959
to see what it would look like more

277
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
ragged and things like that but i think

278
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,518
the the tobacco leaves actually have a

279
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,600
certain mustard to them so it actually

280
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,919
if you're at a distance it could look

281
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,399
like satin or silk or you know weighted

282
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,679
silk that is interesting because the

283
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,559
leaves that i received in the middle

284
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,559
like one side of them was a more

285
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,879
golden mustardy color and then the other

286
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,759
side was a very deep almost purpley

287
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,439
brown

288
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,879
so i had a hard time deciding which one

289
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,880
i wanted to use but it ended up being

290
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,720
that the leaves curled a certain way

291
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,399
that was conducive to painting them onto

292
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,519
the dress and things like that so most

293
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,679
of them are

294
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,078
the lighter tan color but i really like

295
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,078
the dark

296
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,759
and i may be one of the few people in

297
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
this room has actually worked in a

298
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,879
tobacco field so i know a lot about

299
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,879
those leaves

300
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
and i was interested in the banana

301
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,120
leaves too

302
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,880
i'm sure you know that you can scrape

303
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,480
those banana leaves and get actual

304
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:27,360
fibers which then you can we were doing

305
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,200
so that's really interesting too anyway

306
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
it's a very fascinating concept

307
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,319
any questions from class

308
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
so if people were curious about your

309
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
source of the tobacco leaves you said

310
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
you ordered them

311
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
yes i ordered them from

312
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,240
well it's my father's friend who lives

313
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,359
in port prince

314
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,519
and a couple from my friend in

315
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,919
santa domingo republic but most of them

316
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,159
are from the plantation like right

317
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,879
outside

318
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,480
i also just have a comment even though i

319
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,720
grew up in upstate new york my

320
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
grandfather grew tobacco and hung it in

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,040
his attic to dry

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,959
and eva had this sword in my office this

323
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,159
morning and it was you know scent is so

324
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,198

it's like

326
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,519
entering my grandparents house is really

327
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
really good

328
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,120
less right now that it wasn't received

329
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,439
yeah yeah my mom is completely

330
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
substantial tobacco and my ra came in

331
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,959
the other day was like are you rolling

332
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,958
cigars

333
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,279
they're actually from here

334
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
from the plantations yeah

335
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,078
yeah so

336
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,879
a couple of them are from

337
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,799
a

338
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,000
compost bin which

339
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,639
someone who works in the greenhouse i

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
don't know if you know where the

341
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,360
arboretum is

342
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,039
near

343
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,759
do you guys

344
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,439
go know what

345
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,958
the welcome center and things like that

346
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,639
um there's a green house that was about

347
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,078
to compost a lot of banana leaves

348
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
um and

349
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,599
i had caught her up the exact right time

350
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,560
because the next day she was going to be

351
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,278
putting my husband so she was

352
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,799
so i got some from there and then

353
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,799
um yeah that's where most of them are

354
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,559
it was it was a

355
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,599
it was an excursion getting them up like

356
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,039
i had

357
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
planned to like bike there and i had

358
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,278
like a backpack to stuff them all in and

359
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,639
then like i got a flat going by funky so

360
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,559
i was like all right i have to meet her

361
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,000
in 15 minutes from west campus so i'm

362
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,000
gonna run and i like ran really fast

363
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,000
good stories

364
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,679
i do think that under on the back of the

365
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,480
address you have to put a label though

366
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,479
that mentions the flammability

367
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
you said you'd done a lot of research

368
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,240
before you started designing the dress

369
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,799
and i was just wondering why you picked

370
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,799
this specific time period i don't i

371
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,120
don't know i think the first thing that

372
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,958
triggered it was

373
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
the banana leaves outside of the welcome

374
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,679
center like i said and i was on a run

375
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,800
with one of my friends

376
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,599
and

377
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,359
she is colombian and was talking about

378
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
coffee or her grandparents like

379
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
harvesting coffee beans or something

380
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,159
like that and then we started talking

381
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,919
about how the store banana republic is

382
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,159
not the first time that term has been

383
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,198
used and banana republic was really like

384
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,000
started

385
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,439
in

386
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
like referring to

387
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,519
like guatemalan

388
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,159
unfair trade practices and things like

389
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,839
that with big business there um and so i

390
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,278
think it was just a mixture of like her

391
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,880
and i go and buy the banana plants and

392
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,159
then we walked by banana republicans

393
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,439
stay at the mall and i was like well

394
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,000
that'd be kind of

395
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,880
weird to do a dress like that

396
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,879
so i think that's what it

397
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,078
to be the queen

398
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
because i just think

399
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,078
you have to do this kind of wave i mean

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,078
you didn't do this it was like

401
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,078
you started almost not moving your wrist

402
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,720
so it was the bag

403
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,279
yes well now six actually because the

404
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,798
dress also so is it the bag the gloves

405
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,678
the hat the shoes and the necklace

406
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,160
right

407
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,160
thanks so much

408
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
so the leaves were mostly hemlock

409
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,679
designer

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,038
um on the dress and the handbag yeah

411
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,038
that must have been difficult to

412
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,719
get on everything a lot i mean

413
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,479
there's pretty small leaves it looks

414
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,079
like it's totally covered

415
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,440
what this leaves what are there beans

416
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,439
so that was part of it as well

417
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,880
so there must be something under there

418
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,559
that you included onto but

419
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
well the dress itself and then i moved

420
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,599
them onto the dress

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,480
it was looking very different from this

422
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:14,240
now everything's falling apart

423
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
i love the maple leaves

424
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,200
color

425
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,879
of course the queen tends to be

426
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,319
some kind of monochromatic you know

427
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
she's always like blue pastel pink

428
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,480
green

429
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,840
and

430
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,440
it's very

431
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:33,599
impressive i'm just wondering if we can

432
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
call this queen within her salad

433
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
looks green

434
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,359
so first of all it's a tremendous amount

435
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,119
of work and you can see that all those

436
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,000
beans and we even have beans in the

437
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,239
necklace yes are those wired on or those

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,960
are hatchimals

439
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,120
actually um the necklace itself came

440
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,720
from the hat so the hat came with some

441
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,279
pores around it

442
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
so i initially wanted to do a malleable

443
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,038
pine twig

444
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,880
but it wouldn't work over the hat so i

445
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,519
just took the cords off the hat and then

446
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,440
just put the mask around it glued it on

447
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,038
and then glued

448
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,798
the beans onto it and did some

449
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:13,440
multicolored beans on the end

450
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,558
it's quite impressive your hat um that's

451
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,880
the moss from you so that that actually

452
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,558
looks like a lot of the other materials

453
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,799
that we use every day you know something

454
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,279
like polar fleece even that's made from

455
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,720
the soda bottles

456
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,639
and then also a wool of felt

457
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,360
so that you could take the wool fibers

458
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,759
and

459
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,759
by adding moisture and agitation and

460
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,919
heat then you get this felted fabric and

461
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,160
that's what your half looks like so you

462
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,240
really achieve the look of the material

463
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
that people are familiar with but yeah

464
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,200
you're using something really creative

465
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,600
and innovative

466
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,759
what what is that

467
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:54,000
feather thing in your hand

468
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,000
it's um it's dried white pine needles

469
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,359
that's that's really that's really crazy

470
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,519
i actually sew it onto the hat

471
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,399
so i sewed it on and then i put the

472
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,400
beans over it to hide it right

473
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
just

474
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,519
then i put them onto the hat and then i

475
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
just

476
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,720
you know around the needle and break

477
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,720
through the height of your time

478
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,519
pack them on there and then just make a

479
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,519
pattern over here

480
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,320
here's some really interesting

481
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,000
structures too on your

482
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,960
on your handbag

483
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,880
is that twining or braiding that goes

484
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,960
around the light color it's flying fiber

485
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,600
blind fiber um we made some stuff in

486
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,840
class and i am asked the professor for

487
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,959
some leftovers that she had what's that

488
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,959
rambia yeah i

489
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,080
the contrast of the textures that you

490
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,640
get by the different techniques so the

491
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,558
moss looks like a non-woven fabric and

492
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,880
then you've got what looks like twining

493
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,038
or grading around the purse you've got

494
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,039
the flat application

495
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,119
that we might do when we're appliqueing

496
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,960
anything on the garment so you really

497
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,959
mix the textures and the structures

498
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,080
and does the class have any questions

499
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,280
how did you get the gloves

500
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000
well on started with this one first and

501
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,000
then i just kind of changed my way out

502
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,000
um it's weird because when i was doing

503
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
it at home

504
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,519
i knew i got this one right and then for

505
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
some reason i thought i had this one

506
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,798
right now and i just put it on i

507
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,798
realized

508
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,720
no i'm from jamaica but jamaica was once

509
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,720
colonized by england so i don't know the

510
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,839
idea in my head

511
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,079
are you familiar with the phrase

512
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,000
it's like that

513
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,240
it's a cherry thing and

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,558
men and women dress up in these clothes

515
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,319
that are like covered with like pearls

516
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,399
and beans and beads

517
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,879
and it just looks like that's like an uk

518
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
tradition

519
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:39,359
well i i went online and actually looked

520
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,359
up some pictures of queen elizabeth

521
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,679
so i i mean being colonized by indian i

522
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
already know that you know she has a

523
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,519
glove single and a necklace

524
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,519
but i know that um

525
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,119
she wore a variety of hats sometimes

526
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,798
they're really broad sometimes they're

527
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,759
like this so

528
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,720
i just chose this one and

529
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,720
made it look like her

530
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,798
where did you get all the different

531
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,519
materials from did you collect a lot of

532
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,359
them yourself i did it was painstakingly

533
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,720
hard

534
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,158
all these materials are from the

535
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
property actually there's a great

536
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,400
gentleman named phil who actually helped

537
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,480
me um he took me to the sources and

538
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,798
actually showed me where they were

539
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,240
i think it's on mall drive or somewhere

540
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,960
i don't know what the name is right just

541
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
below bb hall there's like a plantation

542
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,679
here right there so i had to go there

543
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,679
and and cut them

544
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,839
oh my shoes yeah well um

545
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,400
i i sprayed the glue on there and then

546
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,839
well this was probably i don't know

547
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
i stuck up the other morning until

548
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,918
probably like almost three o'clock

549
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
i went down to the garden and i picked

550
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,759
some hemlocks like branches of them and

551
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
then i came home and stripped them off

552
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,960
like a little tiny hemlock where you

553
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,000
guys actually stripped them off into a

554
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
bag

555
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,319
so i went to bed like three o'clock then

556
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,759
then i woke up the next day and i

557
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,200
sprayed the glue on and then just um

558
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,480
you know sprinkle the hemlock leaves

559
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,240
over and then just

560
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,240
put some cones along the top

561
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,120
any more questions

562
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
