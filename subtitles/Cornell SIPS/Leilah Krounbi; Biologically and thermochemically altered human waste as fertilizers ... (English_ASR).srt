00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:13,070
okay hi so my name is Leila corny and

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,410
I'm going to talk to you about a project

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,028
that I've been working on regarding

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,339
biologically as thermo chemically

7
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:23,589
altered human waste converting it to

8
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,589
into fertilizers and soil conditioners I

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,399
became involved in this project through

10
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:30,800
a broader initiative that was put out by

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,780
the Gates Foundation called to reinvent

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,270
the toilet challenge I was sort of very

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,010
low on the totem pole in terms of people

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,690
that were involved there was a project

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,670
called the climate foundation which was

16
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:43,549
awarded one of these prizes for

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,200
developing a pyrolysis based toilet so

18
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:47,659
it's a toilet that takes the solid waste

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,340
and converts it into charcoal and they

20
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,639
contacted Johannes lemon and they asked

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,100
him to be involved and then I somehow

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,009
got involved and and the goal of this of

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,660
this call was to was to generate waste

24
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:01,849
management systems that are off the grid

25
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:04,640
so basically non water-based waste

26
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,049
management systems particularly which is

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,450
particularly important in developing

28
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,280
countries where sometimes the population

29
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,359
density and informal settlements of so

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,659
high you can't even put in

31
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:16,968
infrastructure and obviously you know

32
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,039
one of the objectives is to remove germs

33
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:20,928
and recover valuable resources such as

34
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:23,060
energy clean water and nutrients and

35
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,530
this is where johannes and i came into

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,289
the project we were working on

37
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,968
converting the Charter or assessing

38
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,799
whether the charcoal was a valuable

39
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:33,559
resource with regards to nutrients and

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,299
the and all project proposals had to

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,340
demonstrate that their plan cost less

42
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,389
than five cents per user per day and it

43
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,039
was supposed to promote sustainable

44
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:43,759
services in poor urban settings so this

45
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:48,289
is this is a context in which I I've

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,209
been working on my dissertation and this

47
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:53,388
is the physical context in which I

48
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:55,819
worked for about a year in Kenya this is

49
00:01:53,388 --> 00:02:00,618
a picture from Kabara it's one of the

50
00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:03,228
most I guess like renowned or nefarious

51
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:05,209
I don't know slums in in Kenya it's not

52
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:07,390
the biggest and it's not the worst but

53
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,689
but this is a this is a common sight

54
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,060
because waste management is generally by

55
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:18,680
justin disposal so open defecation open

56
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,120
dumping and what you have is a problem

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,799
with an excess of nutria

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,080
but actually this problem with an excess

59
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,730
of nutrients in urban areas is common

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,290
all around the world I think we all

61
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:31,189
understand that there's a decoupling

62
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,539
between the nutrients generated and you

63
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:34,430
know concentrated areas of human

64
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,530
environment or or where animals are

65
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,629
produced where animals are grown and

66
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,128
areas where crops are grown I mean even

67
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:41,870
in the Northeast you have this problem

68
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:43,518
where areas were they were there are

69
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,049
large dairy farms you have a large

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,789
concentration of nutrients in areas

71
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,260
where people are growing maize they are

72
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:49,848
applying tons of mineral fertilizer

73
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,189
because there's this decoupling and this

74
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:54,139
is particularly prominent in developing

75
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:56,750
countries where there's absolutely no

76
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,068
way so there's no waste treatment at all

77
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,329
it just goes into the ambient

78
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:02,780
environment it just stays in the

79
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,790
waterways around Nairobi and this

80
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,590
problem of excess it manifests as excess

81
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,959
pathogens and health problems excess

82
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,170
nutrients loading into the water and

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,908
excess greenhouse gases whereas over in

84
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:16,158
western Kenya where a lot of the maize

85
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:18,289
is grown you have the opposite problem

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,030
we have a deficiency how the soil

87
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:21,889
fertility deficiencies people can't

88
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,019
afford to buy new fertilizers I don't

89
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,759
have access to them which result in

90
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,980
yield deficiencies and they cause human

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,358
nutritional deficiencies and here you

92
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,668
can see what a little bit of fertilizer

93
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,530
can do for a crop this is a maize plot

94
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,299
that's not receiving receiving any

95
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,919
fertilizer and this is a maize crop

96
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,359
that's receiving only 80 kilograms of

97
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,609
nitrogen per hectare and so if we could

98
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,739
just try to couple these systems take

99
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,689
some of this excess and put it here we

100
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,628
might really you know be on our way with

101
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,789
helping people and so and so our

102
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,289
collaborators on the ground in Kenya

103
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,739
that were also involved in this project

104
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:57,439
are a latrine project started by some

105
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,329
MIT business students that basically

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,430
recognized a business opportunity in

107
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,379
waste management in the slum called

108
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,689
stanner G and you know their business

109
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:07,459
model is to Co sanitize waste by

110
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,198
collecting it transforming it which is

111
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,659
our what we're in the business of

112
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,969
transforming waste and generating energy

113
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:17,149
either energy or some valuable product

114
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:19,370
and they're so they're located in

115
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:23,959
nairobi kenya and they're the train

116
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,759
system it operates it's it's called a

117
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,038
urine diversion system where the solid

118
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,629
waste is collected and one portion of

119
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:31,879
the liquid waste in one and that's very

120
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:34,040
important when you're sanitizing waste

121
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,360
because most canonization processes in

122
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,520
all heat I mean there are some that

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,620
don't like anaerobic digestion or fatty

124
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,930
acids things that large engine is Labs

125
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,370
is working on but our methods thermo

126
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,740
chemically transferring waste and also

127
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,079
compensation they they necessitate heat

128
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,650
and so you don't want you want as low of

129
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,259
a water content as possible and and also

130
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:55,339
what you get r22 resources you get the

131
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,539
solid portion of the waste and the

132
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,489
liquid portion of the waste and they

133
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,350
have different benefits when they're

134
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,750
processed properly and that presents

135
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,250
energy is only processing ways through

136
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,100
compensation and that's sort of where we

137
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,069
came in we were trying to see if

138
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,110
pyrolysis was another maybe a more

139
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,930
actually a more efficient solution for

140
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,120
them and I just wanted to so this is

141
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,990
from their website so at present I just

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,670
downloaded this yesterday they they have

143
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,439
932 active toilets they sell the

144
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,540
latrines to people that then operate

145
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,660
them by pay it's like fifteen cents to

146
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,910
use them and then they have about 50,000

147
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,820
users a day so I'm going to use that

148
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,530
number to calculate some basically what

149
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,779
the potential nutrient recovery would be

150
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,489
from these 50,000 I call them fresh life

151
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,679
Cooper's because the latrines are called

152
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,400
fresh life latrine so here is somebody

153
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,860
using a fresh light latrine and he's

154
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,519
generating on average 50 grams of dry

155
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,360
human waste per day that's sort of the

156
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,669
values are all over in the literature

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,379
but this is what we we measured at

158
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,730
Sanergy this is what we measured coming

159
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,829
out of the latrines based on the people

160
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,230
that we're using them and in that 50

161
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,279
grams of dry human waste today based on

162
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,069
the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium

163
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,929
content that I measured we can generate

164
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,759
about 1.4 grams of nitrogen point 5

165
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,550
grams of phosphorus 0.5 grams of

166
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,469
potassium and in the urine two people

167
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,750
generally excrete about one liter a day

168
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,160
which on a mass per volume basis about

169
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,600
one percent nitrogen point seven percent

170
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,120
phosphorous is 2 percent point two

171
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,490
percent potassium we have 10 grams of

172
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,129
mineral nitrogen 7 grams phosphorous two

173
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,199
grams of potassium so we add that up and

174
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,779
we want to convert that into how many

175
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,939
farms we can fertilize per year from

176
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:38,329
those 50,000 fresh life poopers so what

177
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,889
we get over one year if we just account

178
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,069
for the nitrogen in the urine which we

179
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:44,990
know is plant available we go to 130

180
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,019
eighty three tons per year just from

181
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,389
those 50,000 people 155 tons of

182
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:52,698
it's 46 tons of potassium and with that

183
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,340
we can fertilize these are some new

184
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,419
trick the the fertilizer nutrient

185
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,739
recommendations for the Ministry of

186
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,750
Agriculture I understand that that's

187
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,030
very low but but you have to understand

188
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,860
that people are applying zero so 90

189
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,478
kilograms is a lot for a farmer in

190
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,908
western Kenya we can fertilize over two

191
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:09,978
thousand farms a year just using these

192
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:12,019
fifty thousand people

193
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:13,370
sorry just using the waste generated

194
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,149
from these fifty thousand people and

195
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,949
that's great so another question is well

196
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,779
why pyrolysis there's so many other ways

197
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,889
to sanitize waste you can just do

198
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,799
composting you can do anaerobic

199
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,750
digestion you can do this incinerate but

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,770
the thing about pyrolysis is that first

201
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,029
of all I think you understand that

202
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:31,579
people are interested in it because of

203
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,989
its energy this is its efficiency with

204
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:34,879
regards to energy it's kind of

205
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,840
exothermic to a certain point under

206
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,370
certain conditions but I think in this

207
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,158
context it's important to consider that

208
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,870
right now energy they're just using

209
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:47,509
composting so these are wind rose at

210
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,649
Sanergy and you have to get for thermal

211
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,210
Fela compensation to work you have to

212
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:51,799
get up to sixty degrees Celsius and

213
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,959
there really is actually a kind of a

214
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,658
cold place it's like high up it rains a

215
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,728
lot and they I've been told that they

216
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:00,168
can rarely get above 55 degree Celsius

217
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,589
we have to leave it out for about nine

218
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,750
months

219
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:04,668
but with pyrolysis these temperatures

220
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,680
assure sanitization and a very short

221
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:08,538
time you know was in a day I mean the

222
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,459
goal of the of the reinvent the toilet

223
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:12,918
project the people we were working with

224
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,750
was to convert to tons of wasted day

225
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:18,109
into charge like that was so you know

226
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,300
like the plan and the anoxic conditions

227
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,490
so pyrolysis is like incineration with

228
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,728
no oxygen the and ice conditions reduce

229
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,918
carbon so so carbon becomes reduced and

230
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:29,689
less I mean I you know less microbial

231
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,609
available or more persisted in soil and

232
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,918
it concentrates nutrients because what

233
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,450
goes off during the process is carbon

234
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,799
oxygen hydrogen and you get a

235
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,169
concentration of the plant essential

236
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,838
nutrients it requires obviously less

237
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:44,059
time and less land than compensation and

238
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,980
I wanted to show this data just because

239
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,778
I know that there are a lot of issues

240
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,060
with bio solids and I'm not for bio

241
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,950
solids and this is not bio solids this

242
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,469
is not mixed with industrial waste and I

243
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,990
wanted to also show you that the problem

244
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,149
with pollutants in Kenya is not coming

245
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,039
from people I will disregard with

246
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,289
regards to heavy metals obviously you

247
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,299
know

248
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:04,980
did not measure xenobiotics and anyways

249
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,419
with pyrolysis that would be a problem

250
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,159
but with regards to heavy metals just

251
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:13,620
leaving the waste in the environment

252
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,360
increases the concentration of lead and

253
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,459
arsenic relative to treating it

254
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,839
immediately and this was what we did we

255
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,909
took the computed immediately we have

256
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,470
much lower lead concentrations than the

257
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:24,240
compost that was sitting out for months

258
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,329
and that's just because of the ambient

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,220
environment very polluted in Nairobi and

260
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:30,269
so the treatment met the the treatment

261
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,740
methods that I'll be talking about in

262
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,120
this presentation I called a biological

263
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,589
sanitization which is composting there

264
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,000
are other methods for Biological

265
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,350
standardization like anaerobic digestion

266
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,240
which I'm not going to talk about and

267
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,879
I'm going to talk about thermo chemical

268
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,519
methods so including Tora faction at

269
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,259
200° but this doesn't really alter the

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
chemistry of the material it mostly

271
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,370
serves sedessa kated but it's still you

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,430
know an toxic and you considered that

273
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,230
and pyrolysis which is thermo chemical

274
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,919
transformation between 300 and 700

275
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,970
degrees Celsius so the research

276
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,799
questions that I'm going to address

277
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,930
right now are let's start with the first

278
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,059
one which properties of treated human

279
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,559
waste have adverted values so what is it

280
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,208
about this material that might improve

281
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,888
crop yields I mean is that the surface

282
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,349
areas of the phosphors of the nitrogen

283
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,610
is that something you know rhizobia I

284
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,740
didn't test all these things with but I

285
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,389
just interested in getting an idea of is

286
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,120
there anything valuable adultress

287
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,860
material and particularly I wanted to

288
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,528
try to convert some of the agronomic

289
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,089
properties into a monetary value

290
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:32,399
relative to fertilize the price of

291
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,540
fertilizer and I try to quantify not

292
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,919
just the nutrients but also what I

293
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,259
considered to be soil conditioning

294
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:41,068
properties I was also interested in

295
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,600
whether the nitrogen the phosphorus is

296
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,159
available in these different amendments

297
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,139
and soils and whether it differs across

298
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,088
soil so if I incubate these amendments

299
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,129
and soils what happens to nitrogen and

300
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,079
phosphorus availability and so to that

301
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,659
end I incubated them in soils that

302
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,289
differed in pH and texture and my third

303
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,230
objectives

304
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,879
having a general idea that most of the

305
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,399
nitrogen in the waste was probably not

306
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,198
plan available I wanted to see if I

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,909
could incorporate the nitrogen and urine

308
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:07,559
into pyrolyze human waste to produce a

309
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:09,629
high-value soil amendment knowing that

310
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,188
nitrogen is first and foremost the most

311
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,110
limiting nutrient obviously there are so

312
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:14,069
many other limiting nutrients but I feel

313
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,600
like you know the

314
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,590
Oh hanging fruit of taking care of a lot

315
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,509
of plant issues is adding nitrogen and

316
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,370
so I tried to develop a process for

317
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,860
precipitating nitrogen from year and

318
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,330
into pyrolyze human waste not relying on

319
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,680
necessarily the chemical properties of

320
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,270
the waste was just trying to create a

321
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,739
solution environment that that could

322
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,720
happen within which that could happen so

323
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,399
here my first objective determined the

324
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,200
agronomic properties and values of human

325
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,970
solid waste so when I say Granata

326
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
properties I'm talking about things like

327
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,970
plant essential nutrients like

328
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,460
phosphorus magnesium calcium I'm also

329
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,800
talking about properties like liming it

330
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,300
can this material consume acidity

331
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,339
does it have carbonate it's sort of

332
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:56,339
embedded in the matrix what about

333
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,379
nutrient retention is it's or being you

334
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,290
know calcium what about nitrogen and

335
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,029
also is it a source of stable carbon and

336
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:06,360
stable carbon is important we know from

337
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:08,429
you know like soil health because it

338
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,629
actually affects these things liming a

339
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,589
nutrient retention but it also is

340
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,990
important from an environmental

341
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,480
perspective we want to mitigate the

342
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,100
oxidation of waste because at this point

343
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,870
the wastage is going into the ambient

344
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,399
environment and completely oxidizing or

345
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,049
being converted to methane

346
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,929
I would like to stabilize some of that

347
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:26,969
cart carbon so we want the goal is to

348
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:29,159
take this weak little plant add a little

349
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,519
charcoal and get a nice looking plant

350
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:35,189
alright so to start I had to I had to

351
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,740
create some human waste charcoal so me

352
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,540
and some people not this guy but some

353
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,029
other people we well I took this from

354
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,709
the internet but we we collected some

355
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,029
way so these are the buckets that you

356
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,519
collect the solid waste and from the

357
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,720
toilets and the jerry cans is a urine we

358
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,490
collected that and I just want you to

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,990
know that it's very but the human waste

360
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,480
is very different than like bio solids

361
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,180
which has a very high concentration of

362
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,039
mica of bacteria because it's you know

363
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,489
under undergoes digestion and it's not

364
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,169
like Pig waste because it's actually

365
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,519
because of the way that people use the

366
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:07,559
latrines they put sawdust the cover

367
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,870
material it's mixed with sawdust like

368
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,909
mostly eucalyptus at a one-to-one Drive

369
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,350
volumetric ratio and so looks like this

370
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,779
and it's sort it's a little bit more

371
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,120
like animal like like cow manure almost

372
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,980
like the texture and so we had the Sun

373
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,360
dryer to get it below 35 percent

374
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,159
moisture because again we're thermo

375
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,139
chemically transforming it so we need to

376
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,969
have as low of a water cond as possible

377
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,519
we pyrolyze it in a unit that actually

378
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,339
kiyo sent to the collaborators and then

379
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,480
we did some analyses and those analyses

380
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:39,550
included we extracted macronutrients so

381
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,259
well first of all we extracted nitrogen

382
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:43,059
with potassium chloride we wanted to get

383
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:44,889
the the plant available nitrogen on just

384
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:46,750
the total nitrogen and then we did we

385
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,389
just did a male if extraction of these

386
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,649
macronutrients and these micronutrients

387
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,240
very simple just to get a sort of a

388
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,240
proxy for what the nutrient availability

389
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,009
would be in this material and then and

390
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,659
then and then I looked at the soil

391
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,000
conditioning properties which again I I

392
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:03,818
determined would be the liming potential

393
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,649
which is I calculated as the calcium

394
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:09,909
carbonate equivalents li using a back

395
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:12,759
titration with sodium hydroxide and then

396
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:16,929
I try to quantify I basically use the

397
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:20,259
cation exchange capacity to assess how

398
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,849
how much how much of the base cations in

399
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,639
the material could be retained over time

400
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,579
and I tried to quantify that turn that

401
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,198
into a metric that that actually is just

402
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:32,409
in in milligrams per kilogram of

403
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,240
nutrients and then I quant I tried to

404
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:36,429
quantify the stable carbon expected to

405
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,350
remain after a hundred years I called it

406
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:42,909
BC plus 100 using a metric which is the

407
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,800
content the molar concentration of

408
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:46,990
hydrogen two organic carbon which is

409
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,639
sort of like a metric for the aromatic

410
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,110
carbon versus aliphatic carbon so it's

411
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,339
something it's the carbon that the

412
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,629
organic carbon that you would expect to

413
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:58,269
remain in the soil and this is this what

414
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:00,399
I got so this top graph the y-axis is

415
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,339
the is the nutrient concentration in

416
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,379
each Amendment amendments being the

417
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,639
compost the torrefied ways the two

418
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,740
pyrolyzed weights at two different

419
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,019
degrees the nutrients being the

420
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,669
extractable nitrogen these these

421
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:15,610
nutrients micronutrients

422
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:18,849
and then CEC is the contribution of CEC

423
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,500
towards nutrients by retaining what the

424
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,300
potassium calcium magnesium that's

425
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,068
already in the soil and I have a

426
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,588
calculation for that and I didn't show

427
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:28,179
that I can show anyone that's interested

428
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:29,559
so what I can see here is that as I

429
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:32,049
increase with highest heating

430
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:34,629
temperature I have more nutrients

431
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:37,028
because because the the nutrients become

432
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:40,629
concentrated because actually there's a

433
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:41,740
yield loss of mass loss with as the

434
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,409
product is

435
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,659
subjected to thermal treatment so at 500

436
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,759
degrees I actually only am retaining 30%

437
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,559
of the original mass and most of what's

438
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,200
lost is carbon oxygen and hydrogen so

439
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,579
the nutrients are concentrated

440
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,040
nevertheless even though I still lost

441
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,009
you know maybe 70% of the carbon and

442
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,899
hydrogen and oxygen and still I still

443
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,090
have well I didn't lose Sony because I

444
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,829
can still have 70% according to this

445
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,220
metric of what could be considered

446
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,720
persistent carbon in this material

447
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,629
compared to all the other materials and

448
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,300
so in so in conclusion the pyrolized

449
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,429
human weighs 500 degrees it contains

450
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:20,620
about 15% more nutrients and torrefied

451
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:22,929
waste 100 percent more nutrients and

452
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,549
composted waste and about 600 percent

453
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:27,489
more stable carbon than either of these

454
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,779
and that can translate into a monetary

455
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,049
value and now we're going to calculate

456
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:35,470
that so to calculate to put a dollar

457
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:37,329
sign i i i just took fertilizer and lime

458
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,009
prices from different sites from this

459
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,780
really nice site that has prices for

460
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,759
fertilizers in east africa as well as

461
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,269
international prices and good old

462
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,470
alibaba

463
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:49,659
and i also calculated the I try to put

464
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,519
$1 percent on the stable carbon using

465
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:54,129
discount prices from a World Bank report

466
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,629
that I used you know 20 different

467
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,090
countries to average out what a carbon

468
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,830
discount rate would be and the the

469
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,870
amount of money per amendment is

470
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,370
basically the summed value of all the

471
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,720
agronomic components including the

472
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,970
nutrients including the line me

473
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,319
including the stable carbon and again I

474
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,519
mean as you got you guys know with

475
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,369
prices especially when you're talking

476
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,599
about Africa International over time

477
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,819
there's a huge sensitivity of the

478
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,469
amendment value on on the market prices

479
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,730
and so the quartile values are really

480
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,829
you know all over the place so I just

481
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,589
looked at the median market price for

482
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,359
all of these nutrients so what I got is

483
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,549
this so first of all I just want to say

484
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,619
so that so the y-axis is US dollars per

485
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,480
ton per ton of what so here it's per ton

486
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,789
of feed stuff per ton of the initial

487
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,170
waste before it's treated with anything

488
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:37,359
so everything's been normalized to what

489
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,160
I call they yield like like the math

490
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,109
yield coming out of the out of the

491
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,080
treatment process and so what you can

492
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:46,029
see is as the material is subject to

493
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,329
higher heating there's more mass lost

494
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:51,490
and that decreases the value of the

495
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,619
waste respect it basically it's what the

496
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,569
waste processing plant seeds of what

497
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:57,149
they feel they feel they have

498
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,769
material they're getting less money

499
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,580
because they have this mass loss this is

500
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:04,839
US dollars per amendment per because us

501
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,279
always four ton of amendment of the

502
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,259
final product this is what the farmer

503
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,599
sees so if you give a farmer a bag of

504
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:14,200
this this is what they see they see all

505
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,879
this phosphorus and potassium and so it

506
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,950
has a very high value but they're also

507
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,090
not paying for the overhead cost so I

508
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,640
just want to demonstrate that there are

509
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:23,889
two ways to put a dollar value on this

510
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,180
product it's either what is in the hands

511
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,890
of the farmer that would otherwise have

512
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,210
been buying fertilizer or what is in the

513
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,960
hands of the waste processing that has

514
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,269
to sell the amendment and if you are

515
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,950
just the farmer you'd much rather have

516
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,629
the the higher temperature material

517
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,250
because it has more nutrients in it and

518
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,660
you're going to save money if you're the

519
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,369
waste processing plant you'd much rather

520
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,140
process this material because you're

521
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,599
getting more money per unit map that

522
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,120
you're collecting and I also want to

523
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,949
point out that there's really like the

524
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,779
big difference here is just between the

525
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,960
thermochemical treatments and the

526
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:58,180
biological treatment I mean it's just

527
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,960
completely different and I think that's

528
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,670
because the compost is not really like

529
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,880
the feedstock anymore I think it's been

530
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:10,509
contaminated with soil it has a very

531
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,710
high concentration of iron aluminum and

532
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,079
manganese because it's sort of been

533
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,059
mixed in the wind rows whereas the 200

534
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,740
degree material is almost is the most

535
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,690
similar to the feedstock so I just think

536
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,039
that the constant process fundamentally

537
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,809
changes the maturing they all

538
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,329
fundamentally change the material but to

539
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,710
in an undesirable way so anyways so in

540
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:29,889
Africa and by the way these are

541
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,600
fertilizer prices the prices through

542
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,030
which these were generated were taken

543
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,559
from the African fertilizer prices not

544
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:39,369
the International although it's all

545
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:41,109
insane websites and so in Africa a ton

546
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:42,129
of human solid waste process at 500

547
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:44,139
degrees would give me two hundred

548
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,270
forty-five dollars mostly from

549
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,070
phosphorus and potassium so the value of

550
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:51,700
thermo chemically treated waste is more

551
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:53,710
than four times the composted waste now

552
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,509
I just wanted to show this just to

553
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,160
compare what the price international

554
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:59,319
prices are and to show that the value is

555
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,060
really different where you are in the

556
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,849
world like the value of your waist looks

557
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:05,049
different if you're in the United States

558
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:06,939
where you can buy fertilizer prices

559
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,169
using the International on the

560
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,990
international market or whether you're

561
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,140
in Africa

562
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,210
so for a 500-degree waste in Africa you

563
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,940
might think that that bag that ton of

564
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,460
material is saving you 245 dollars

565
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,120
whereas here at $61 with 61 dollars why

566
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,288
would I even bother

567
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:26,178
and and potassium and phosphorous are

568
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:29,140
disproportionately higher in Africa than

569
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,860
some of the other fertilizer prices

570
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,230
so in conclusion

571
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:35,209
pyrolyzed wastes at 500 degrees has the

572
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,179
highest nutrient concentration cell

573
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,890
conditioning properties now this is not

574
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:43,190
very impressive but if I just generated

575
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:46,399
an extractable NPK value I have zero

576
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,620
nitrogen 0.8 percent phosphorus and 1%

577
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:50,148
to calcium now again when you talk about

578
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,709
organic amendments usually they're

579
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:55,519
presented in the total elemental

580
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,440
concentration not in P 2 O 5 or K 2 O so

581
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,950
you know this is not that bad for it B

582
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,019
extractable and it has a hundreds and

583
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,509
higher nutrients on the compost 50%

584
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:07,639
higher than the torrefied waste but now

585
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:09,288
I want to talk about the money that

586
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,028
we're getting so this is what Sanergy

587
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:12,558
sees this is if I was processing waste

588
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,970
this is the kind of money I'd be making

589
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,950
if I was collecting this way so they are

590
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,329
collecting the waste I don't know and

591
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,190
they are selling the compost and the

592
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:22,009
urine I but I don't really know what

593
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,830
they're selling it for but according to

594
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:27,288
my estimations those 50,000 people using

595
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:29,808
their toilets for generating 50 grams of

596
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:32,119
dry waste a day at a 30 percent mass

597
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:34,398
recovery for the 500 degree treatment

598
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,798
only give me point seven five tonnes of

599
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:40,849
waste and if this is a price per ton I

600
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:43,429
only get $190 every day from those fifty

601
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:46,759
thousand people but if I use the 200

602
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,890
degree processing method I have 90

603
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,140
percent mass recovery because it's tore

604
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,909
affection only dehydrates the waste and

605
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,278
I'm assuming I've already dried it down

606
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:57,980
to begin with is 50 grams of dry weight

607
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,480
so I get a lot more money I look I get

608
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,390
five hundred eighty two dollars a day so

609
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,210
this I think these values I mean for for

610
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,038
a program that's trying to implement

611
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,950
this it as an intervention that you have

612
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,839
to really consider who you know who

613
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,149
these prices are for they're there for

614
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,278
the processing plant of the farmer so my

615
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:18,469
second objective we already know we've

616
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,819
gone over this agronomic value now we're

617
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,169
going to look at do different human

618
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:22,609
solid waste amendments affect soil

619
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:25,040
nitrogen and phosphorus

620
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:27,079
different ways in different soils and so

621
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,069
I incubated them these amendments and

622
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:33,230
soil differing and texture and pH and pH

623
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:35,269
so my hypothesis was that where that I

624
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,250
would see a trade-off with the available

625
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,629
nitrogen and the available phosphorus

626
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,190
with highest heating temperature there's

627
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,540
a lot of literature to demonstrate that

628
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,360
so I thought well I would surely see

629
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,339
that as well so I'd lower the products

630
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,779
that were subjected to lower

631
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,919
temperatures like the compost in the

632
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,899
torrefied ways they would probably

633
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,850
generate a lot of nitrogen whereas the

634
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,259
pyrolized ways especially the 500-degree

635
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:56,480
would probably have a lot of phosphorous

636
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,980
definitely low respiration stabilized

637
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,360
carbon and would probably have a high pH

638
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,789
I also wanted to see what would happen

639
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:07,459
if I incubated the 500 degree material

640
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:08,990
the biochar with urine assuming that a

641
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,519
lot of this nitrogen isn't available and

642
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,190
I would probably have to offset the lack

643
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:16,250
of a nitrogen with a mineral source now

644
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,070
in the literature biochar has been noted

645
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,140
to accelerate nitrification for through

646
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:22,819
different mechanisms by by having a

647
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,009
lining effect by serving phenolic

648
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,079
compounds by providing services for for

649
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:30,079
autotrophic nitrifiers it's also been

650
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:32,659
noted to increase the pH so if the

651
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,699
nitrification processes is exacerbating

652
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,130
a soil acidity which could lower the pH

653
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,419
well I think that adding biochar with

654
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,960
that mineral nitrogen should stabilize

655
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,640
the pH generate a lot of nitrate which

656
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,960
is plant available and keep the

657
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,419
phosphorous available so that's what I

658
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,769
thought that I would not see a negative

659
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:52,610
effect of adding this mineral nitrogen

660
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:55,129
on soil acidity with biochar I also

661
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:58,219
thought that in terms of the interaction

662
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,290
between the the amendments I was adding

663
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,230
and the soils I thought that at lower

664
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:05,089
hht as high as heating temperature the

665
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,798
amendments treated at lower temperatures

666
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:08,480
and the lighter texture so the sandy

667
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,789
soil would probably promote greater

668
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,279
carbon and nitrogen mineralization I saw

669
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,558
that the stable carbon is much higher at

670
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,779
the higher temperatures and at since

671
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,220
sandier soils that the inclusion of this

672
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,079
amendment would probably increase

673
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,480
surface area allow for more microbial

674
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,949
activity so I expected that and I also

675
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,779
expected that there would be greater

676
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,058
phosphorous availability when I add the

677
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,160
higher heating temperature chars in

678
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:33,079
acidic soil so that they would buffer

679
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,240
the pH maintaining phosphorous

680
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:38,509
availability

681
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,519
so to start me and Herald Venice we

682
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,200
collected some soils in western Kenya it

683
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,930
was kind of a wild goose chase

684
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,029
finding the soils that had two soils

685
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,799
that had a low pH and a and a sandy

686
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:52,490
texture and - so that at a higher pH and

687
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,690
a low me texture or clay texture so we

688
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,359
collected them from three different

689
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,830
watersheds this is the lower yellow

690
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,629
watershed this is the mid yellow

691
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,589
watershed this is the yonder watershed

692
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,270
and these have been very well

693
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,859
characterized by it craft and people

694
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:06,049
that have worked here before like Doris

695
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:07,369
Hill tourists and daveed good Enya and

696
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:09,200
maybe even doubt what I'm not sure

697
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,909
they're they're well-traveled this they

698
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,160
know this area maybe they know some

699
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,259
people and so the so that we collected

700
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,430
from lower yella was a notice all well

701
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:18,220
these were both Ultra Sol's

702
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,330
according to the Kenyan soil map

703
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,360
although they were very different this

704
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:27,049
was a cement Smith also sell at like a

705
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:29,179
sandy textured soil that and I performed

706
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:32,180
XRD on all the soil so I sort of got the

707
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,740
fingerprint the mineral mineral

708
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,200
fingerprint had a lot of Keio lighted in

709
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,900
highlight this is a very red soil and it

710
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,990
was had a coarser texture with a clay

711
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,490
loam and had a low pH this soil here was

712
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,839
actually a mala Stahl it looked like a

713
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,920
virtus all it was like a black cotton

714
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,579
film they used to grow a lot of cotton

715
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,430
around here

716
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:51,470
I had an alkaline pH had montmorillonite

717
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,380
caroline ID and a lot of oxides had a

718
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,960
high manganese concentration and as well

719
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,260
that was kind of in the same vicinity we

720
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,880
were lucky we actually got a financial

721
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,779
San in SEPTA's all sorry I totally

722
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,540
messed that out anyway

723
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:07,160
so this isn't inceptive salt so it

724
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,259
doesn't have a lot of profile

725
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,210
development but it was I did have a

726
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,059
sandy texture was kind of dusty and it

727
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,180
had a you know a fairly non acidic pH

728
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:19,069
and it had a very high concentration of

729
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,960
extractable manganese as opposed to

730
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:23,389
using our incubation so the incubation

731
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,700
was like a jar with in a jar with

732
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,990
another little jar that trapped the

733
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,140
carbon dioxide that was coming out of

734
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:32,120
the soil and so what we did is we is we

735
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,190
incubated four different amendments the

736
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:37,459
biologically process way so torrefied

737
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,100
ways these two pyrolyzed ways and four

738
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,620
different soils the these four soils

739
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,509
that I just described and I also did the

740
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:47,959
second experiment where incubated the

741
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:50,839
pyrolyzed waste with urine in excess

742
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,210
so I have pyrolized waist with urine

743
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:55,368
just the urine and the nothing and the

744
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,759
amendments were added at about a 10

745
00:26:55,368 --> 00:27:00,589
tonne per hectare ratio and they were

746
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,240
added on a weight basis just point 5

747
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,829
percent by weight so they weren't

748
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,138
normalized to carbon or nitrogen they're

749
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:09,259
just added on a weight basis and the

750
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:11,089
urine was added in accordance with what

751
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,730
I would call the resource availability

752
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:15,378
of urine to feces generated from a fresh

753
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,628
like latrine so I just took the

754
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:19,819
proportion of human waste and urine

755
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:23,928
generated on a daily basis and I added

756
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:26,240
that in that same amount so I added a

757
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:29,179
lot of nitrogen I added it in excess I

758
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,009
added about 500 kilograms per hectare

759
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:33,440
and the urine also contained phosphorous

760
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:35,839
about 30 milligrams or 50 kilograms

761
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,308
phosphorous per hectare and I had enough

762
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,589
charge to where I could destructively

763
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:42,710
sample at four time points day zero 7:30

764
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:44,749
and 100 during which I tested this trap

765
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,778
for carbon dioxide and I extracted these

766
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:48,740
soils the whole entire sample with

767
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:51,829
potassium chloride to get the mineral

768
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,169
nitrogen when this graph is kind of a

769
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:56,898
summary of what I found so on the y-axis

770
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:58,490
you can see this is the phosphorous the

771
00:27:56,898 --> 00:28:01,069
difference of fosters between day 100

772
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,990
and days zero on the x axis I have

773
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:05,408
mineral nitrogen concentration the

774
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,940
difference between day 100 and a zero

775
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,889
these the shapes of the series they

776
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,899
correspond to these amendments this

777
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:14,778
upside down triangle is at 200 degree

778
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:16,849
this diamond is a 300 degree this

779
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:18,950
forward triangles 500 the box is a

780
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:21,278
compost and the star is unamended soil

781
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,419
and the magnitude of the series is

782
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:26,929
representative the magnitude of carbon

783
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:29,419
respiration and these this is the ultra

784
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:31,190
salt of Sandy ultra salt and this is

785
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,590
that in sepsis all what that has the

786
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,940
high manganese concentration so what I

787
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:41,028
see is that the lower temperature indeed

788
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:44,350
there is a trade-off between highest

789
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:47,200
heating temperature 200 300 500 and

790
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:49,099
nitrogen and phosphorus availability

791
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,629
although that doesn't really follow

792
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:51,888
through with the compost which I also

793
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,569
would have expected to be down here

794
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:54,740
because again I think the compass is

795
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:56,210
fundamentally different it's been

796
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,259
altered by it with all the soil that's

797
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,569
been added to it so that's why it

798
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,420
behaves just like the soil and also you

799
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:03,639
see that the shape of this series

800
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,289
is much bigger because the nitrogen has

801
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,809
been generated through through the cause

802
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:09,490
of mineralization of the organic matter

803
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,990
and that's why not necessarily this

804
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,750
amendment but in the whole treatment

805
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,190
it's this amendment promoted the

806
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,410
mineralization of a lot of organic

807
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,519
matter and that's why the series is so

808
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,500
big enough so there's so much nitrogen

809
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,150
whereas this amendment it was not

810
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,160
readily did not promote a lot of

811
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,650
mineralization and and phosphorus was

812
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,410
not immobilized but there's still a huge

813
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,298
difference between the results and these

814
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,798
two sites even though they are of a

815
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:34,539
similar P agent even though they're a

816
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,359
similar texture and I think that's just

817
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:40,298
because of the mineralogy of the soils

818
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,609
so again I do see this trade-off between

819
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:44,289
nitrogen and phosphorus with highest

820
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:46,058
heating temperature and I think it's a

821
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:48,220
function of the carbon mineralization at

822
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:49,720
least in the soil the compost did not

823
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,769
compare to the torrefied waste even

824
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,650
though they were at the same temperature

825
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:54,639
and I think that the explanation might

826
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,798
be the dissolved organic carbon

827
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,740
concentrations in these amendments which

828
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,839
happen to be much higher an order of

829
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,240
magnitude higher for this 200 degree

830
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,829
torrefied waste rather than the compost

831
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,950
I think that's probably what explains

832
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:10,928
some of these results so if a farmer had

833
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,179
access to at least one of these whether

834
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,429
this or this he might get something good

835
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,410
if he just applies the 500 degree

836
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,929
material the difference in phosphorus

837
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,910
relative to the control soil adds up to

838
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,620
about 22 kilograms of phosphorous per

839
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,080
hectare and these conversions were done

840
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,959
assuming a 15 centimeter depth and a

841
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,039
bulk density of 1.1 and if he just had

842
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,679
this torrefied waste

843
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,960
he'd get about 64 kilograms of nitrogen

844
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,059
per hectare relative to the control soil

845
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,160
so that's not bad

846
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:41,950
and again I think that the difference

847
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,779
between the results in this soil which

848
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:48,210
has a similar texture in pH to this soil

849
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:51,099
is the concentration of ammonium oxalate

850
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,710
extractable amorphous oxide aluminum

851
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:56,609
iron and manganese which is about two

852
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,900
percent by weight in this soil and it's

853
00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:00,639
0.5 percent of Nestle and so there may

854
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,380
have been phosphorus fixation here

855
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,020
whereas there may have been microbial

856
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,970
immobilization immobilization here those

857
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:09,129
are just my thoughts for the second

858
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,630
thing I wanted to look at was I wanted

859
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,220
to see if I added the biochar with the

860
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,900
mineral nitrogen what happens to soil

861
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,100
acidity and - phosphorus availabilities

862
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,700
the first thing I noticed

863
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:20,949
is that adding biochar with with urine

864
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,179
did not increase nitrification or at

865
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,919
least didn't increase the amount of

866
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,659
extractable nitrate they were not

867
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,919
significantly different in this soil and

868
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:31,750
this this sandy ultra saw and also

869
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,809
adding the biochar with urine did not

870
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,909
help in terms of the pH the pH was very

871
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:41,408
much acidified with this urine and the

872
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:43,059
biochar was even a little worse yet so

873
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:44,799
there was no difference in nitrate or pH

874
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:46,148
the ratios were probably extremely off

875
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,609
in terms of the amount of nitrogen I

876
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:50,709
added so yet the phosphorus availability

877
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:52,599
was not inhibited so this is the same

878
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,970
graph that you just saw with the the

879
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:56,949
y-axis was phosphorus the difference

880
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,288
between a 100 and a zero mineral

881
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,700
nitrogen de 100 and day zero these are

882
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:02,980
the series that I had presented and

883
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,288
these two series are this is the biochar

884
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,849
with urine this is just the urine so you

885
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:08,919
can see that obviously we have a lot of

886
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,839
nitrogen because we've just added a

887
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,980
bunch of nitrogen there's the voucher

888
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,369
doesn't effect the nitrogen

889
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:17,649
concentrations after a hundred days and

890
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:20,439
but the and and the phosphorus is not

891
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:21,758
negatively affected by that exacerbated

892
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,580
acidity so there's still a lot of

893
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,960
phosphorous that that's available

894
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:28,089
although in this soil with the high

895
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,710
manganese concentrations all of these

896
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:32,019
amendments performed very poorly

897
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,639
although the urine by itself wasn't that

898
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,579
bad so there's a very big difference

899
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:38,619
between the soil types and the nitrogen

900
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,418
and the phosphorus response some of the

901
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:41,859
conclusions I definitely saw a trade-off

902
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,538
between nitrogen and phosphorus with

903
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,949
highest heating temperature but only

904
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:46,839
among the thermal chemically treated

905
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,610
waste not the compost probably a

906
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,709
function of carbon respiration predicted

907
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:53,349
by amendment dissolved organic carbon

908
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,360
texture did not play a role not maybe

909
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:57,278
not even pH necessarily but rather the

910
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,008
concentration of amorphous oxides or

911
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,288
ammonium extractable oxides when they

912
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:04,089
added this pyrolized waste with urine

913
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:05,950
did not enhance the subscrible nitrate

914
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:07,808
did not mitigate acidification although

915
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,548
phosphorus did remain unaffected which

916
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:11,288
is good so maybe this is a good

917
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:12,788
amendment maybe pyrolized wasted urine

918
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:13,750
is a good amendment although we still

919
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,819
obviously have to deal with the

920
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,200
acidification

921
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,349
so my last the last thing I'll talk

922
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,269
about is so we've gone over some

923
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:23,589
agronomic properties and values we

924
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:25,450
looked at nitrogen phosphorus

925
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:27,788
availability and now we're going to talk

926
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,930
about whether we can increase the value

927
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,700
by incorporate

928
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,710
the mineral nitrogen in urine into the

929
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:36,160
pyrolized way so I'm not just adding it

930
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,930
as a separate liquid but but sort of

931
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,790
intercalating the nitrogen into the

932
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,950
matrix so we can apply it as a granular

933
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,629
fertilizer so that and we've been trying

934
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,370
to develop a process for precipitating

935
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,860
your nitrogen into pyrolyzed waste

936
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:49,449
urines everywhere so so our goal in

937
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,359
combining mineral nitrogen and urine

938
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,960
with biochar again I want to emphasize

939
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:57,759
that most of the nitrogen is in

940
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,500
household waste is in urine and all of

941
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,720
most of this nitrogen about 90% is

942
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,059
mineral to plan available whereas the

943
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,370
nitrogen and solid waste is very little

944
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:08,440
and it's generally organic and the

945
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:11,230
species of nitrogen urine is urea which

946
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,990
will hydrolyze immediately in soil and

947
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,480
in us in a in a container that you know

948
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:19,449
is sort of used often with urease into

949
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,329
ammonia and during that process the pH

950
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:24,969
will go from about 6 to 9 and at 9

951
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:27,279
you'll end up having about 1/2 ammonia

952
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,000
and half ammonia and a full urine can

953
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,690
smell really bad

954
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,369
and that's other reasons but and so and

955
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,860
so when you talk about like loading

956
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,809
nitrogen onto the biochar matrix you're

957
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,160
dealing with two different forms of

958
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,360
nitrogen you are dealing with ionic

959
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,149
ammonium and then you're dealing with

960
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,099
very reactive ammonia which can be

961
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:51,550
dissolved in water or it can be in a

962
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:54,670
gaseous form so some I'll just go over a

963
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,670
few of the mechanisms which are of

964
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:59,590
interest in trying to you know develop

965
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,720
this process you can just have

966
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:04,780
nonspecific physisorption you could just

967
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,519
have nitrogen ammonia more ammonia just

968
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,320
sort of being trapped in the pore space

969
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,739
of the biochar we all know that biochar

970
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,809
is renowned for its surface area for

971
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:15,579
micro porosity so you know you could

972
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:17,860
just be retaining nitrogen through

973
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,769
occlusion import that the only caveat is

974
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,630
that you since the diameter of ammonia

975
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:24,009
is about 3 angstroms you need to have

976
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,070
pores that are of a similar magnitude

977
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,600
maybe 10 to 15 10 to 20 angstroms or

978
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,920
else you're not going to Van der Waals

979
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,139
forces are not going to be effective at

980
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,700
all and honestly I don't know what the

981
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:35,440
micro porosity of my char is I am

982
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:37,539
assuming it's mesoporous

983
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,750
that may not be very important of a

984
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:41,759
mechanism another factor that you know

985
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,199
that we

986
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,440
we understand from soils with cation

987
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,329
exchange capacity we could have a

988
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,030
retention of ionic ammonium also weak

989
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:53,789
bonds on deprotonated hydroxyl groups on

990
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,010
anions maybe sulfur maybe Foss phosphate

991
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:58,679
we could also have retention at Lamoni

992
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:01,170
ax which they're strong sorption on

993
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,849
broads and acid groups so because we

994
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:06,240
know that ammonia has its free electron

995
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:09,569
pairs that can either receive a proton

996
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:12,750
and that is a strong surgeon or it can

997
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:16,140
actually interact with for example in

998
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:18,929
this carboxylic group the oxygens have

999
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:21,389
created a dipole so this is very

1000
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:24,149
nucleophilic this is electrophilic and

1001
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:25,650
so this nitrogen could essentially this

1002
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,210
ammonia is essentially bond in this

1003
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,579
carbonyl group and form an amine group

1004
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,019
so this is possible and so this is

1005
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,179
strong sorption this is no longer

1006
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:35,009
extractable nitrogen but it could

1007
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:37,259
probably be easily mineralized in soil

1008
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,110
so these are different mechanisms that

1009
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,580
we can have but again I was mostly

1010
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,079
interested in just pushing this to the

1011
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,159
max I was like forgot all these surface

1012
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,779
functional groups I just want to

1013
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,069
precipitate an ammonium salt on the

1014
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,019
surface I want to get this I just want

1015
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,400
to get a whole bunch of nitrogen on the

1016
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:55,590
surface that we can just put in the soil

1017
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,329
so so ammonium salts you have many

1018
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,740
ammonium salty of ammonium sulfate you

1019
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:00,059
have struvite that's something that

1020
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,209
people have looked into struvite is

1021
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,799
ammonium magnesium phosphate and it

1022
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,320
often just precipitates in waste water

1023
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,970
strains precipitates you know in in pig

1024
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,830
manure but the problem with some of

1025
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:13,500
these other ammonium salts is that

1026
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,809
you're going to have to you know import

1027
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,059
this this counter ion but since we're

1028
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:20,549
dealing with pyrolysis we have a counter

1029
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,139
and we have bicarbonate so we have

1030
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,210
carbon dioxide carbon tax it is a waste

1031
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,629
product of pyrolysis right and since

1032
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:30,269
urine is a pH of 9 if we inject a carbon

1033
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,160
dioxide into the urine we are we can

1034
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:34,980
speciate it as bicarbonate maybe

1035
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,389
probably not as carbonate so I'm just

1036
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,949
saying that why thought will bicarbonate

1037
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:39,719
you know maybe that's a good good

1038
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:41,009
counter ion because anyways we don't

1039
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,980
want to spend more money on some of

1040
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:47,820
these other things unlike a sulfate or

1041
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,079
or or or magnesium so anyways anyways

1042
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,130
but we're just going to go back now

1043
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,630
we're going to go through some of these

1044
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,940
function mechanisms and look at what we

1045
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,619
have okay so now we're going to look at

1046
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,420
n loading but via physisorption

1047
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,389
and and cation exchange sort of like

1048
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,880
Lewis acid-base interactions on oxygen

1049
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:05,579
functional groups at on the 500-degree

1050
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,950
material so when I talk about surgeons I

1051
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:10,319
want to maximize all the portfolio of

1052
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:11,699
options because again I have different

1053
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,190
types of nitrogen I've got this

1054
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:17,369
heterogeneous surface you know biochar

1055
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:21,059
so here on this y axis I have the

1056
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,889
surface area of different human waste

1057
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:24,480
that that's treated at different

1058
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:27,690
temperatures here I have the compost the

1059
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,519
torrefied waste the 300 400 500 700 this

1060
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,460
is the surface area meter square per

1061
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,940
gram you see it goes up the temperature

1062
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,349
here I have the cation exchange capacity

1063
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,170
millimoles of charge per kilogram and it

1064
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,789
goes down because as we as the material

1065
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,380
is heated you have a loss of these

1066
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:45,029
functional groups with with heating

1067
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,950
temperature but since I'm trying to

1068
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,930
diversify the portfolio of options for

1069
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,629
sorption I want to get into this sweet

1070
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:53,909
spot area I would I want a little of

1071
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,130
everything so I'm going to go with a 500

1072
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:57,929
degree I'm going to say I'm not soaking

1073
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:01,260
on this this is what I'm going to use to

1074
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:03,449
load up the nitrogen because look if I I

1075
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,430
can take this value the surface area

1076
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:07,679
value and I can convert it to how many

1077
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:10,440
potential moles of ammonia I can get and

1078
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:14,699
when I do this conversion I mean I can

1079
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,990
even get an increase in 4.3% of mineral

1080
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:18,299
nitrogen on the surface just to

1081
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:20,639
physisorption but again you have to

1082
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,860
remember that this requires micropores

1083
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,289
and I really don't know if I have you

1084
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,530
know I have not yet calculated this data

1085
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:29,820
so we'll put that on hold for now in

1086
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,980
terms of electrostatics sorption

1087
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,870
mechanisms it doesn't seem like the CC

1088
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,150
is promising me a lot of retention of

1089
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:38,279
nitrogen the amount of ammonium I can

1090
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,900
retain so Sevilla Williams it's only

1091
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,680
about increases my mineral nitrogen

1092
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,110
content by 0.31% points so doesn't look

1093
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,799
very promising so why don't we just look

1094
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:51,390
at the total potential of solving

1095
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,070
nitrogen through these acid-base

1096
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,900
interactions whether strong function or

1097
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,370
weak search and I'm going to say I just

1098
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,170
want to look at the oxygenated

1099
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:00,659
functional groups as a proxy for how

1100
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:04,050
much I can even get so here I have this

1101
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:06,420
SK our spectra from wood an oxidized

1102
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,880
wood which have a high proportion of

1103
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,210
oxygen in functional groups which can

1104
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,220
adsorb

1105
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,360
ammonia or ammonium and I have my char

1106
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:14,159
the human solid waste these are all

1107
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:18,960
pyrolized with 500 degrees this was

1108
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:23,369
oxidized after pyrolysis so here I have

1109
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,349
this carboxylic point at about 1700 wave

1110
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:27,449
number and you can see that in the

1111
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:29,460
oxidized wood it's very strong it's kind

1112
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:31,739
of you know there in wood but it's very

1113
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,079
absent in my char I just don't have this

1114
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:37,879
is not a material it's not like wood it

1115
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,500
doesn't have these sort of oxygenated

1116
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,119
heart it doesn't have these kind of

1117
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,449
functional groups in the same proportion

1118
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,119
here's a phenolic peak here for o h and

1119
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:49,889
co and again i could see it with wood

1120
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,659
but i really don't see it in my char the

1121
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:53,579
office that I actually have this amine p

1122
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:56,009
because i so much minute over an organic

1123
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,630
nitrogen so honestly i looking at the

1124
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,670
spectra i'm like i don't really know if

1125
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:01,860
this material is going to is going to

1126
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,659
really sorb ammonia or ammonium through

1127
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,280
these interactions but you know i say

1128
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:07,529
okay let's put that on hold for now and

1129
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,150
let's just do an experiment let's just

1130
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,769
take a bunch of urine we're going to

1131
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,480
take some biochar from Sanergy and we're

1132
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,860
going to mix it all together and we're

1133
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,840
going to look at how much nitrogen we

1134
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,610
can actually sorbonne to the biochar so

1135
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,250
I took some fresh urine from Sanergy I

1136
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,539
acidified it to a pH of 6 to try to get

1137
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,550
all the nitrogen as ammonia

1138
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:26,719
I took some fresh urine that was already

1139
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:29,039
at a pH of 9 through that you know Hydra

1140
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,719
through the urease interaction and then

1141
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,289
I had a controlled deionized water I

1142
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:37,019
just added the biochar made from Sanergy

1143
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:38,579
at 500 degrees this is the ratio I added

1144
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:40,050
that and I determined the nitrogen

1145
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,259
loading by combustion on the stand

1146
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:45,750
analyzer at a craft and so what did I

1147
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,000
see I saw that that acidified urine was

1148
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,159
the only treatment that actually gave me

1149
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,409
a little bit increase in nitrogen I got

1150
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,869
a 1.1 percent increase in total nitrogen

1151
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:57,750
assuming it's mineral after this

1152
00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:00,359
experiment so what so that means that I

1153
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,800
was probably retaining ammonium because

1154
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,200
most of the nitrogen was speciated as

1155
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,370
ammonia and this actually is greater

1156
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,319
than what would have normally been

1157
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,849
predicted by cation exchange capacity so

1158
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,660
there must be some other mechanisms at

1159
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:14,400
play so now I'm going to move on to what

1160
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:16,139
I thought might be more promising and

1161
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,389
that was trying to precipitate a

1162
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:20,219
nitrogen salt on to the surface of the

1163
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:21,929
bike are basically using the biochar

1164
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:26,338
like nucleate

1165
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:28,739
these salts and so I had a system where

1166
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:31,170
I had these jars and I made extensions

1167
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:32,549
with this concentrated nitrogen solution

1168
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,139
like a synthetic urine solution and

1169
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,579
added a bunch of biochar I injected

1170
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:36,838
carbon dioxide I did a whole bunch of

1171
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,490
different configurations of this

1172
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,799
experiment to see if anything would

1173
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,629
precipitate and what I ended up doing is

1174
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,250
I raised the pH of this very

1175
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:46,680
concentrated ammonium chloride with

1176
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,940
sodium hydroxide so high and did this

1177
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,828
injection with carbon dekhta that I

1178
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,019
actually got sodium bicarbonate

1179
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:53,519
precipitation it was very strange but

1180
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,460
but that was not what I wanted so

1181
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,338
anyways so I eventually settled on that

1182
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,318
I really needed to to start moving

1183
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:02,578
towards working in the gas phase and I

1184
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:04,679
probably should have done this with

1185
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,230
ammonia but I didn't I kept ammonia

1186
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,029
solution because I think that water

1187
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:12,869
especially since the solution was at a

1188
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:14,609
pH of 9.25 ammonia similar to water can

1189
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,800
form hydrogen bonds so water is probably

1190
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:18,929
interfering and all of these potential

1191
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,609
interactions and so I I needed to

1192
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:23,368
probably need to move towards working in

1193
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:25,739
the gas phase so I used three different

1194
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:29,250
types of by trees wood on oxidized wood

1195
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:30,629
oh sorry this is oxidized wood and I

1196
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,690
used the human waste they were all

1197
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,358
pyrolized at 500 degrees and my final

1198
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:38,579
configuration was I would I immersed the

1199
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:40,699
char into the inch of this concentrated

1200
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,740
nitrogen solution for half an hour and

1201
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:46,019
then I filtered it and then I flushed

1202
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:48,209
carbon dioxide gas over the surface of

1203
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:52,019
the char and what I was hoping to do was

1204
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:55,170
to sequentially sorb nice ammonia and

1205
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:56,579
then on the amine functional groups that

1206
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,809
I thought I might be incorporating sort

1207
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,068
of carbon dioxide and they make a

1208
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:02,430
ceremony I was trying to do this whole

1209
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:03,900
thing and I didn't really work out so so

1210
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:05,250
what I got so I trying to trying to

1211
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,568
eventually basically get like the

1212
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,068
precipitation of owning bicarbonate

1213
00:44:06,568 --> 00:44:10,619
through gaps through like the sorption

1214
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:14,039
of these of these counter ions what I

1215
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,690
saw was that on the y-axis of this graph

1216
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,900
I have the percent increase of total

1217
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,639
nitrogen from the exposure to the Year

1218
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,920
in solution and here I have this

1219
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,779
categorical variables of carbon dioxide

1220
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,608
exposure to carbon dioxide gas and

1221
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,099
nitrogen gas which is just the control

1222
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:31,078
and I have these three different

1223
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:32,940
materials I used my human solid waste

1224
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,920
jar the oxidized wood in the unoxidized

1225
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,530
wood and I saw that there was

1226
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,539
all significant difference in the amount

1227
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,970
of nitrogen that was loaded onto the

1228
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,858
char this was measured by combustion I'd

1229
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:46,779
see now I mean you can sort of like

1230
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:49,358
you're like oh god of a trend instead of

1231
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,010
moving up you know and maybe that's true

1232
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,598
and I do think that if I I need to

1233
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,150
reconfigure this and I think I might be

1234
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:58,960
able to actually see what I'm trying to

1235
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,960
see but as it stands I was definitely

1236
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,500
able to increase the nitrogen

1237
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,240
concentration and all of it just

1238
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,579
exposure to nitrogen to this

1239
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,039
concentrated solution for a pretty short

1240
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,510
time I was able to increase the total

1241
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,579
nitrogen which I'm assuming is mineral

1242
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,619
from that solution by between two point

1243
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:16,000
six and five percent evidence of a

1244
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:18,400
slight increase with carbon dioxide

1245
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,389
obviously not really but kind of you

1246
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,700
know and that there could be

1247
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:22,808
interference with water and so I think

1248
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:24,548
that I we just in a different

1249
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:28,089
experimental design it's just it's not

1250
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:31,088
the right way to do it so and I just

1251
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:33,940
wanted to show what one last thing was I

1252
00:45:31,088 --> 00:45:35,828
then took these chars back and went to

1253
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,440
see CMR and we looked at the FTIR

1254
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:39,760
spectra of these three different chars

1255
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,220
that I've already shown you before so

1256
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,079
the blue line is are the control these

1257
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:46,000
are the spectra that you already saw

1258
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,970
just the chars without exposure to

1259
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,829
anything the red line are the chars that

1260
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:52,929
were immersed in the solution and then

1261
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:55,480
exposed to carbon dioxide through the

1262
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:57,039
flushing and the green line are the sort

1263
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,838
of like the control chars that were

1264
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,900
exposing the Mersenne the solution that

1265
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:05,318
exposed just to just to just inert

1266
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:09,280
nitrogen and what I saw is that in all

1267
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:10,869
of the chars I got the I was able to

1268
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,369
distinguish it there were two new Peaks

1269
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:19,450
that formed at the 1400 area and at the

1270
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:23,108
3,000 area here this area here and all

1271
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:28,469
of the materials sort of more prominent

1272
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:31,929
in the oxidized wood and this 1400 peak

1273
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:34,539
corresponds to ionic ammonium so either

1274
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:36,669
this is sort of crystalline on the

1275
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:38,798
surface or electrostatically absorbed

1276
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:41,289
other people would know better like

1277
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:41,710
Anita and Mike I'm just a novice but I'm

1278
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:45,519
learning

1279
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:47,920
and then these two peaks are so what I

1280
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,269
learned is that these two peaks together

1281
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,309
can be indicative

1282
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:57,579
fangs of an amine and I did correlate

1283
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:59,860
that my this one website is automatic

1284
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:01,420
that this I could have the corporation

1285
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,099
of a mean functional group sort of

1286
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,849
through what I had shown you about that

1287
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:07,960
bronsted interaction this ammonia

1288
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:10,119
absorbing to these functional groups

1289
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,039
through this nucleophilic addition and

1290
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:14,799
forming these amine groups so I think

1291
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:16,630
that here I might be seeing ammonia

1292
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,890
Sorbian hairy ammonium and here I might

1293
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,050
be seeing ammonia sore because and

1294
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:22,239
remember the pH was right at the pKa soy

1295
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,340
both species in solution and so that's

1296
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,409
very interesting because I think with my

1297
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,600
carbon dioxide saying I need more of

1298
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:32,109
these functional groups to get this to

1299
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:34,509
work anyways so that is my chair data

1300
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,150
and so in conclusion I just want to say

1301
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:39,820
that it's going to say that despite your

1302
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,590
proportion of carboxyl and finola oh I

1303
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,240
another thing I notice I say this is

1304
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:47,980
that there's a phenolic peak in the in

1305
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:50,109
the wood that here at about 1200 that

1306
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,250
disappears after exposure to nitrogen

1307
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,300
it's not you don't really see it in the

1308
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,420
human waste because I didn't really have

1309
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,070
that to begin with anyways so um so the

1310
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,990
society or proportion of car box and

1311
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:02,080
phenolic groups humans always served

1312
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:05,829
about 3 percent mineral nitrogen nut 2.6

1313
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,150
more than the CC predicts possibly you

1314
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,679
know I don't know if it's through

1315
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,139
physisorption so is this precipitation

1316
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,879
or you know maybe some other things so

1317
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,469
I'm just looking at these mechanisms so

1318
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,500
anyways and so in conclusion I just want

1319
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:19,569
to say that the pyrolyzed waste noticing

1320
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,760
chemically poised to retain ammonia or

1321
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:24,190
ammonium based on acid-base interactions

1322
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,900
and less by metals because initially the

1323
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,700
fjr spectra should a low proportion of

1324
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,070
oxygenated functional groups in CEC

1325
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:32,319
however we are retaining both ammonia

1326
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:35,019
and ammonium so your an absorption

1327
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,850
showed retention this first experiment

1328
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:38,590
the ft airport to the incorporation of

1329
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:41,079
amine groups probably through ammonia

1330
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,780
ammonium ammonia and precipitation was

1331
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:46,449
not observed visually may not be

1332
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:48,990
possible with water you know in in in an

1333
00:48:46,449 --> 00:48:53,109
innocent solution so in the end we

1334
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:55,449
achieved n loading by 2.5% points giving

1335
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,550
us our total extractable NPK of two

1336
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,710
point five point eight and one it's not

1337
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,120
bad for an organic amendment I said it's

1338
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,059
worth further iterations because

1339
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,210
remember key bear

1340
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:07,250
and the maestro and so I just want to

1341
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,349
thank so I'm done and I just want to

1342
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,239
thank my advisers yo.hannes

1343
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:13,009
and Harold Rebecca Nelson and I put Beth

1344
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,269
mad Becky she was I worked with her in

1345
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,790
the Eiger and she's a good friend of

1346
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:20,869
mine and people at Sanergy and the

1347
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:22,670
climate foundation Fausto and Brian and

1348
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,130
obviously people in your highness

1349
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,320
layman's lab especially Akio and Kelly

1350
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:29,180
at Dorian Rachel who leads so many

1351
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,280
things and everyone else has been so

1352
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:32,509
amazing Alyssa Kirsch with whom I did a

1353
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,610
lot of these other experiences in

1354
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,470
undergrad and others Marie McBride a

1355
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:39,829
when I t-84 him I would always be like

1356
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:42,349
one on that nitrogen and Janice shy REO

1357
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:44,539
over Frank cassavas lab Mike for helping

1358
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:48,019
me analyze the problem the interpret the

1359
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:49,279
spectra Jonathan a Kathy how all these

1360
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:51,530
people people at University of Nairobi

1361
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,760
and see now because they let me like run

1362
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,670
their machines and mess everything up

1363
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,120
and Hugh did an analysis so I just want

1364
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:01,190
and also the funding from the I Gert

1365
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:03,389
poverty reduction and the all these

1366
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:13,030
different things so thank you very much

1367
00:50:03,389 --> 00:50:13,029
[Applause]

1368
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:19,449
yeah

1369
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:34,140
yeah okay so okay I really can't speak

1370
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:36,329
from from you know empirical results I I

1371
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:38,129
don't I've never tested this although we

1372
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:40,559
did test PAHs and dioxins and they were

1373
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,970
not in the in the chart but in terms of

1374
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,529
you know biotics I'm just assuming that

1375
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:47,849
if you go up to 500°

1376
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,769
assuming 300 to 500 degrees you'll

1377
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:52,289
probably have the transformation of

1378
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:54,630
xenobiotics probably you know aromatic

1379
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:57,210
rings fusing together now with urine is

1380
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:59,400
another story and so that and that is a

1381
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,929
concern because you can pasteurizer and

1382
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,910
very easily you can get rid of the the

1383
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:05,940
pathogenic organisms at about 70 degrees

1384
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:07,769
Celsius but but you know we know that

1385
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,480
urine has antibiotics so actually the

1386
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:11,460
the process that I'm interested in now

1387
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,409
looking at urine is trying to store

1388
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,409
nitrogen from the gas phase so you just

1389
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:29,059
avoid the whole issue of xenobiotics is

1390
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:29,059
that yeah that is a problem yeah yeah

1391
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:37,849
yeah yeah you're you're right and in

1392
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:41,140
this paper that I'm writing on the value

1393
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:43,309
I want to subtract from the value the

1394
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,109
contribution from sodium because yeah

1395
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,519
it's like a it's a deterrent well this

1396
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,650
is from the charred waste there's also

1397
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:50,889
sodium in that yeah that's why I think

1398
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:54,289
that there are some issues with

1399
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:57,069
definitely with obviously with sodium

1400
00:51:54,289 --> 00:52:00,230
and I was looking at trying to

1401
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:01,820
concentrate urine using porous membranes

1402
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,340
and you can get membranes that can allow

1403
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,800
sodium is a little bit larger than

1404
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,000
ammonium and so yeah I definitely that's

1405
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,490
been in the forefront of my mind like I

1406
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,780
do have to prevent sodium because even

1407
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:12,519
if you don't have heavy metals that can

1408
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:18,980
ruin everything

1409
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:26,989
yeah I agree with you on that initial

1410
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:32,150
part of the produces a yeah look at all

1411
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:34,159
no yeah yeah yeah yeah no I need to yeah

1412
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:39,619
honestly I'm still figuring out to what

1413
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:42,170
extent I want to like like how far the

1414
00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:44,329
cycle should go but I think that that's

1415
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:47,059
yeah very important transportation cause

1416
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:48,860
I haven't incorporated that yet I I

1417
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:50,719
think it's I think it's important I

1418
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,700
trying to keep it really simple but I do

1419
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,589
think that it's difficult to make an

1420
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:55,969
argument if you're not even considering

1421
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,010
how to get the material to the people

1422
00:52:55,969 --> 00:53:01,059
that are growing the cross I have to

1423
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,060
really consider them

1424
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:04,609
