1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,219
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,259
University

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:08,419
thank you so much for the kind

4
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,939
introduction Julia it's really a

5
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:13,458
pleasure to be back here at Cornell this

6
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,899
is my third visit and enough to say it

7
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:20,350
gets better every time but it also gets

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:24,890
colder every time being in Georgia I

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,109
think the right caliber here but it's

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,910
really lovely I got to have a tour this

11
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:31,628
morning of the boys Thompson Institute

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,030
and enjoy the warmth of some of the

13
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:37,219
different plant growing areas so I'm

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,890
going to talk today about our work on

15
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,859
Medical ethnobotany as a discovery tool

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,838
for identification of novel chemical

17
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,179
scaffolds for the purpose of drug

18
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:49,640
discovery my main interest is an

19
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,460
anti-infective drug discovery but we

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,870
have also worked with collaborators and

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,210
looking for new scaffolds to treat

22
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:01,988
cancer and other viral targets other

23
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,579
than our bacterial and fungal work

24
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:06,200
you'll notice here our little logo if

25
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:08,480
anyone if there any chemists there and

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,879
this is illogic acid one of my first

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,420
major projects was on illogic acid

28
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:19,039
derivatives from from Rubis species so

29
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,150
that's how that came into being so I'm

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,190
going to talk about some of the

31
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,219
challenges that we have with antibiotic

32
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:27,799
resistance I'll go over the ethnobotany

33
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,859
is a key piece to the discovery toolkit

34
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,709
ethnobotany has kind of waxed and waned

35
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,659
over time and the 80s and 90s this was a

36
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:38,209
very respected

37
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,590
approach that was used widely also

38
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:44,479
supported through the National Cancer

39
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:47,150
Institute to to collect and and look for

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,210
new potential sources of compounds to

41
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,660
treat cancer among other targets but we

42
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:56,799
faced a downturn in interest and funding

43
00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:00,049
in the 90s in the later 90s and even

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,729
from 2000 onwards and I feel like we're

45
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,739
finally getting back to a place where

46
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,270
people are starting to go back and

47
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,129
realize that we there's still a lot to

48
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:10,008
discover from the plant world in terms

49
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,598
of novel chemistry I'm going to talk

50
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,818
about how we're expanded this some

51
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,030
toolkit and then give you a few examples

52
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:17,810
of discoveries in this arena for we'll

53
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,459
talk about

54
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,530
the BlackBerry project our work with

55
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,810
chestnut pepper tree in st. John's wort

56
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,459
and for any of you that attended my

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,080
lecture last month of the tent gardens I

58
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,180
apologize for any slides that overlap

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,030
but I think what we're taking a deeper

60
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,209
dive into the science of this talk the

61
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,789
one of the major reasons that we're

62
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,530
working on this area of infectious

63
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:40,909
disease is because we're facing what is

64
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,259
going to be known as the post-antibiotic

65
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,219
era so we had the heyday of classic and

66
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:49,039
bio discovery

67
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,810
starting in the 40s into the 50s with a

68
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,959
lot of these metabolites from swell

69
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,670
microbes but we haven't had much

70
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,280
innovation in terms of antibiotic

71
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:01,309
discovery since then a lot of the new

72
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,318
antibiotics are actually just analogs of

73
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,580
existing structural classes that have

74
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,879
been released and so we're facing a

75
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:11,030
constant battle a game of leapfrog with

76
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,609
these bugs in our search for drugs that

77
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,090
will continue to work and so this is

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:20,030
sums it up I think quite well so

79
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,519
antibiotic resistance is not a new thing

80
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,769
that you know that has has reached the

81
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,870
limelight Alexander Fleming not long

82
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:31,219
after his received the Nobel Prize uhm

83
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,569
put this statement out of the

84
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,949
thoughtless person playing with

85
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,539
penicillin treatment is morally

86
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:37,818
responsible for the death of the man who

87
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:39,199
succumbs to the infection they knew from

88
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,818
the very beginning the antibiotic

89
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,578
resistance was going to be a major

90
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:47,119
problem if we did not take care of them

91
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:49,010
properly yesterday on on Twitter if any

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,289
of you are on Twitter I posted a

93
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:53,030
screenshot from another scientist that's

94
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:56,568
interested in antibiotic stewardship and

95
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,189
he had a screenshot from the website

96
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:01,039
Alibaba are you guys familiar with

97
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:03,560
Alibaba where that you could buy I mean

98
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,179
gram quantities of some of our major

99
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,340
antibiotics are used in human medicine

100
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,439
as well as some of these are in

101
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,840
veterinary medicine you know starting

102
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,060
from ten to thirty bucks online and that

103
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,709
is exceptionally disturbing that these

104
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,918
are so easily accessible through

105
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:21,280
international markets to get not only

106
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,109
being used recklessly and a lot of

107
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,739
veterinary practices in terms of growth

108
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,840
promoters for animals but also this kind

109
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,310
of ease of access through other avenues

110
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,939
as well

111
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,670
in 2016 the British government put

112
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,980
together a report this is known as the

113
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,280
O'Neil report based because it was

114
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,930
chaired by The Economist Jim O'Neill and

115
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,750
one of the key findings of this report

116
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,019
is that tackling animai microbial

117
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,300
resistance will require not only

118
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:57,918
stronger attention to stewardship but

119
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:01,879
also an adequate supply of new drugs to

120
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:04,120
beat resistance as it rises this is

121
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,800
troubling because we've seen a

122
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,649
continuous rise and rates of resistance

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,540
and our current estimates of the number

124
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:14,359
of deaths globally from antimicrobial

125
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,080
resistance are around 700,000 many think

126
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,020
that this is a very conservative

127
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,139
estimate it's anticipated to reach up to

128
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:25,069
10 million per year with current rates

129
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,810
of resistance by the year 2050 for the

130
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,599
first time ever the World Health

131
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,699
Organization released a target list of

132
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,250
pathogens to work on for human health

133
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,949
these you'll note or missing

134
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,259
tuberculosis tuberculosis is of course

135
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,180
still a very high priority for your

136
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,889
discovery they just kind of kept that in

137
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,509
a separate class but these are some of

138
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,459
the the key ones the ones in purple

139
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,810
we're working on in my lab as well as

140
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,120
the one in red I'm going to focus mainly

141
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,478
on our staff or cockle work because

142
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,168
that's where we have more data to

143
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:59,810
present but we are pursuing discovery

144
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:02,240
pathways for some of the escaped

145
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,030
pathogens in a row back Tracey

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,870
pseudomonas staff this new backdoor and

147
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:11,809
so on these gram-negative pathogens in

148
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,939
particular are very difficult to treat

149
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,490
because of issues with penetration of

150
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:20,240
the outer membrane and so we're also

151
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,129
working on trying to find natural

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,930
products from plants that may be on

153
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,550
their own aren't necessarily

154
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,280
antimicrobial but can actually

155
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,870
potentiate or sensitize the bugs to

156
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,029
existing lines of antibiotics so it's

157
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,709
kind of rude that resistance modifying

158
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,119
agents that's one of our main approaches

159
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:38,689
that we're taking with these gram

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,180
negatives right now so the other

161
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,598
troubling aspect to this whole crisis is

162
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,209
that

163
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,019
well we've seen rising rates of

164
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:47,930
resistance

165
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:51,949
the same time we've faced a big

166
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,110
discovery void starting in the 1990s we

167
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,409
don't have any new registered classes of

168
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,629
antibiotics since the late 1980s and

169
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,060
anytime you've seen the news these new

170
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,279
antibiotics again they're not really new

171
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,379
new they're based on the same scaffolds

172
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,929
just slightly modified so resistance is

173
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,969
a constant problem it might work for a

174
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,030
few years and then again we have

175
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,850
resistance to that class again

176
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:18,379
now this also correspond with a shift in

177
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,080
the way that we look for our antibiotics

178
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:23,089
and we moved more further away from

179
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,699
natural products they were still doing

180
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,169
some work with soil microbes and that

181
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:31,310
kind of discovery for natural products

182
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:33,439
but not so heavily emphasized on plants

183
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,540
and more focused on products of

184
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,490
combinatorial chemistry the idea during

185
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,990
this period was if we can build large

186
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,660
enough libraries of hundreds of

187
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,340
thousands of compounds and screen them

188
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,100
with our new you know high-throughput

189
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:48,439
robotics programs that surely something

190
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,810
would hit and does anybody know how many

191
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:54,610
antibiotics came out of that initiative

192
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:58,399
that was Multi multi millions of dollars

193
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,800
zero nothing and a consequence of that

194
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,199
is while we have this emphasis more

195
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,670
towards synthetic approaches which you

196
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,959
know I love synthetic chemists they are

197
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,420
my friends so don't take this as an

198
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,799
affront if your synthetic chemists but

199
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,069
one of the one of the the dire

200
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,509
consequences of this is we saw a drop in

201
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,819
training of people that have that

202
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,490
natural products expertise and that are

203
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:21,409
taking this approach of looking to

204
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,960
different sources of nature for these

205
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,000
new products the other problem was that

206
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,979
we kept rediscovering a lot of the same

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,170
compounds from these different soil

208
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,180
microbes so here are some the latest

209
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,490
representatives of the novel anti

210
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:37,129
bacterial classes that were released

211
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,019
more recently one of these as recently

212
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:42,320
as 2007 but again these were discovered

213
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:44,990
in the 1950s so we need to do better at

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,940
discovery of new classes people are

215
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,970
looking to a number of different natural

216
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,530
sources I'm still screening the soil and

217
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,350
there's some innovative new techniques

218
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,299
that have emerged where there are new

219
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,850
types of growth chambers these ID chip

220
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:01,099
devices that can be used to grow micro

221
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,689
in their native soil environment there

222
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,689
are folks that are working on marine

223
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:08,088
organisms they're going to remote areas

224
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:10,548
of the planet looking at extreme

225
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,889
ecosystems trying to identify perhaps

226
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:14,928
other microbes in the marine environment

227
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,459
or other larger organisms Andry

228
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:18,769
environment as sources of these

229
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:22,028
compounds some are focusing on into

230
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:25,489
fights or fungi that live within plants

231
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,989
some are focusing on genome mining going

232
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:29,028
back to those original sources of

233
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:31,788
antibiotics some on animal proteins

234
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:32,899
right so Halle Gators Komodo dragons

235
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:34,489
these have been kind of some of the

236
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,639
interesting things that have popped out

237
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:39,199
in the news and then plants and fungi

238
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,079
are also on the area where we're

239
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:43,639
particularly focused on now it should

240
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,948
come as no surprise especially to this

241
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,369
audience that plants would be irrational

242
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:52,719
a reasonable place to look for new

243
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:55,428
compounds we have a long history of

244
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,369
successful drug discovery from plants

245
00:09:55,428 --> 00:10:01,220
and in fact many of the drugs that are

246
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,689
in the the World Health Organization's

247
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,329
list of essential medicines were

248
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:08,708
originally derived from plants and have

249
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:10,548
since since then we now synthesize or or

250
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,458
create these compounds through other

251
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:15,318
mechanisms but I think there's a lot to

252
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,719
be discovered here we also know that

253
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:19,849
there are around 28,000 medicinal plants

254
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,939
have been documented on earth this is

255
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,649
from the recent Q report in current

256
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:25,879
estimates for total species is somewhere

257
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:29,149
around four hundred and four hundred

258
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,859
fifty thousand species of plants known

259
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,208
on earth but twenty-eight thousand of

260
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:35,359
those have been documented for medicinal

261
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:36,858
use there are no formal numbers on how

262
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:39,439
many plants have actually been

263
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:43,999
thoroughly investigated for their

264
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:46,519
potential bio activity but as far as the

265
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,408
anti-infective field goes I would say

266
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,509
it's in the very low hundreds of ones

267
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:55,338
that have been really looked at from a

268
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:57,889
robust biological or chemical angle so

269
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,509
why do plants make these compounds is

270
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,808
all about creation of secondary

271
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:04,699
metabolites different tissues will

272
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:08,078
engage a different biosynthetic pathways

273
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:11,568
to create plants for the defense against

274
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,539
microbial invasion or infection now

275
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:15,000
something that's interests

276
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,529
is that perhaps we know that with fungi

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,289
they can create compounds that actually

278
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,850
kill other organisms plants can as well

279
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:24,059
but what we're finding in my work is

280
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,870
that the signaling pathways between

281
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:30,359
plant and and and pathogen there might

282
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,009
be a more intricate or interesting

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,870
communication system there where perhaps

284
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:36,240
they're not just killing these bugs that

285
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,950
are actually preventing their own or

286
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,539
interfering with microbial signaling

287
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,610
systems and that's where we get into

288
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,039
quorum sensing interference which is

289
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,960
what I'll talk about in a bit other

290
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,969
secondary metabolites are at least to

291
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,680
attract pollinators and seed dispersers

292
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,050
they're at least to prevent other

293
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,469
species from germinating within their

294
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:56,909
within their kind of grow zone and then

295
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,740
of course you have secondary metabolites

296
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:03,870
that can be up regulated prevent over

297
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,250
foraging by animals now the other thing

298
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,310
that I think was really interesting is

299
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,559
in 2015 more attention also got placed

300
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,529
on the role of plants entry infectious

301
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,329
disease with dr. u2's received the Nobel

302
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,879
Prize for her discovery of artemisinin

303
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:21,420
and what I love about this story is that

304
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,009
it not only incorporated it was not only

305
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,750
a story about successful natural

306
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,789
products work but it's also a story

307
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,970
about you the use of ethnobotanical

308
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:32,639
tools in that discovery process so they

309
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,769
had yield problems when they're working

310
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,480
with Artemisia they had yield problems

311
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:39,029
with their active compounds and she

312
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,550
actually went back to this five century

313
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,620
old text and looked up the traditional

314
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:45,870
way that this was prepared to treat

315
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,929
febrile illness and in fact it was not

316
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:51,810
created during using standard lab

317
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:54,419
mechanisms of an organic extraction or

318
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:57,599
perhaps a hot aqueous extraction instead

319
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,919
it was you know wrung out in in

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,080
room-temperature water

321
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,029
and indeed they did get higher yields of

322
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,740
their active agent that way

323
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:07,110
so the other thing that's interesting i

324
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,850
think from the artemisinin story is that

325
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,800
now we have widespread Artemis and

326
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,920
resistance of course because we isolated

327
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:17,969
that one single compound from the plant

328
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,500
and used it broadly I think that there's

329
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,000
a lot of lessons to be learned from this

330
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,649
and that when you look at some of these

331
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,570
other studies that have actually tried

332
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:28,819
whole plant therapy you get some

333
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,400
restoration of activity against the

334
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,150
malaria parasite so there may be a role

335
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,649
for all these other structurally similar

336
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,090
derivatives that are kicked off through

337
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,149
that biosynthetic pathway that may be

338
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:43,310
together in unison they can help beat

339
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,899
resistance and that's an area that we're

340
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,759
very interested in when it comes to our

341
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,100
anti effective drugs are we actually

342
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,409
doing a disservice by isolating only

343
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,320
trying to develop single molecules would

344
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:56,779
be better in some cases actually work on

345
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,810
development of refined enriched extracts

346
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,209
that are rich in these molecules and

347
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,849
some of which might have actually

348
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,990
slightly less activity but as a whole

349
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,250
work better together and I'll give you

350
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,549
an example of that with our only

351
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,649
blackberry work so our core research

352
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,409
approach is we have kind of four angles

353
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,360
to the lab we do field work this summer

354
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,219
I was working in the Mediterranean we've

355
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,860
done a lot of field work also in Albania

356
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,080
and in Kosovo and the Balkans we also

357
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,870
collect in the southeast us so we have

358
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,509
plants that come from Florida and also

359
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,490
from Georgia and for those us

360
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,980
collections were relying primarily on

361
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,139
historic records of Native American

362
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,990
medicine medical uses of these plants

363
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:41,169
all of our specimens are deposited in

364
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,210
our barium where you know you have

365
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,429
taxonomic verification that what we

366
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,590
field ID'd is correct and those are

367
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,589
stored there we also have a

368
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:54,680
phytochemistry lab which is where we

369
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:56,840
extract the compounds and to start

370
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,579
creating our library and then we have

371
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,620
microbiology and cell culture so all

372
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,889
this is kind of run under the umbrella

373
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,240
of my research group so in taking the

374
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,919
epidermis hampel approach to drug

375
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,750
discovery again we're starting with all

376
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,429
biological diversity but we're using

377
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,620
this important lens of ethnobotany

378
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,149
to narrow down the field even beyond

379
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,759
these twenty eight thousand known

380
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,919
medicinal plants focusing primarily on

381
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,870
plants that are used to treat infectious

382
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,000
and inflammatory disease I'm especially

383
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,450
interested in skin disease and in

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,340
topical applications of plants because

385
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,810
from a from a chemistry perspective it's

386
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,250
a lot easier to work with those because

387
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:34,779
you don't have to worry as much about

388
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,250
compound degradation as you would with

389
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,110
therapies they're taken internally or

390
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,240
orally

391
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:45,079
these are extracted and we work up

392
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,049
standard mass spec and NMR on these

393
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,699
compounds the other thing that's

394
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:51,259
interesting I think about or unique

395
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,570
about our collection is that we focus

396
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:56,299
again in the Mediterranean Basin the

397
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,190
National Cancer Institute's large global

398
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:00,199
collections they did on the plants and

399
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,360
also marine sources did not include

400
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,089
Europe or the Mediterranean and so I

401
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,589
could clearly say that of all the

402
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,420
collections are out there for natural

403
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,459
products I think we have some unique

404
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:14,360
species or an unique collection of

405
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:17,599
species in this group in the approach

406
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,750
we're using tools from anthropology and

407
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,490
tools from ethnobotany we're actively

408
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,708
interviewing people about how they're

409
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,950
using plants the places that we work are

410
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:31,969
very remote and oftentimes these people

411
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,649
are reliant on knowledge of which plants

412
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,750
to collect in the wild for both food and

413
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:38,990
medicine for example some of our work in

414
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,879
the Balkans they are isolated for about

415
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,539
six months of the year with heavy snows

416
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,278
so they have to actually grow or collect

417
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:48,349
a lot all their food to last throughout

418
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,909
the winter they and then also ferment a

419
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,909
lot of these foods through lactic acid

420
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:54,828
fermentation for long-term storage and

421
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:56,539
potatoes are their major crop here we

422
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:58,069
are in the participant observation of

423
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:00,319
helping to plant potatoes with some of

424
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,390
these ladies we're also looking to old

425
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,650
text as well this is an example of a

426
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:09,039
text from the 16th 16th century that

427
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,449
included notes from a Dutch explorer

428
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,740
traveling in South America and this is

429
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,980
the Brazilian pepper tree it's one of

430
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,828
the plants that we've been working on so

431
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,068
there are when people ask me about how

432
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:23,599
do I pick my field site everyone assumes

433
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,699
for some reason I just like to go to

434
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,250
Italy for the wine which is you know

435
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,289
okay it's not bad and it's a beautiful

436
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,150
place to work but there is a scientific

437
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,819
rationale behind you know why we're

438
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,250
working the Mediterranean it is one of

439
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:41,689
the global hot spots for biodiversity we

440
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,490
have we have over 25,000 plants that are

441
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,429
native to the Mediterranean Basin but

442
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,190
13,000 of those are endemic so there's

443
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,410
again a nice opportunity for collecting

444
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,730
a wide variety of biological diversity

445
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,230
which also then of course

446
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,200
corresponds to chemical diversity and

447
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,940
our drug discovery initiatives what else

448
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,950
is interesting is that you know when you

449
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,279
look at how people use plants in these

450
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,720
areas you have a relatively small

451
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,548
geographic region but you have multiple

452
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,230
languages that are spoken you have

453
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:11,808
different cultures different religions

454
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:15,349
and in fact we've found that even people

455
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:18,740
that share the same ecosystem this is

456
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:19,759
from our paper and in nature plants we

457
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,169
found that even people that share the

458
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,450
same ecosystem if they're from a

459
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:26,270
different culture that have different

460
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,679
linguistic customs and different customs

461
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:29,269
for their daily life they actually use

462
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,179
those natural resources in very

463
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:33,918
different ways and that's especially

464
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,590
relevant to how they use some of these

465
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,429
medicinal plants for day-to-day medical

466
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:42,678
care so to undertake this research we go

467
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,600
through layers of prior informed consent

468
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,669
with both village leaders and also

469
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,349
individuals we follow codes of ethics

470
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,870
for this kind of work where you're again

471
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:52,668
gathering information from people in how

472
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:56,209
they use plants and we also engage in

473
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:58,280
access and benefit sharing this our work

474
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,798
may or may not someday lead to great

475
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,928
outcomes in terms of translational

476
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,789
outcomes for medicine with lots of money

477
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,160
that's always the hope right that you

478
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,808
can find a drug that gets developed but

479
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,019
the reality is that most of these

480
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:15,259
probably won't that won't occur so we

481
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,819
really take a big emphasis on engaging

482
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,308
in access and benefit sharing from the

483
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:21,470
very GetGo so some of the things that we

484
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:24,048
get back to communities are languages or

485
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:27,620
books in the local language we run

486
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:29,599
workshops we also engage in a lot of

487
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:32,989
different exchange programs with the

488
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,548
students so in the field we're

489
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,798
collecting these plants their field

490
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:39,410
dried and then shipped back to the lab

491
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,548
or their ground up with a mill and then

492
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,529
extracted and following various

493
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:47,179
procedures they might be extracted

494
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,399
through organic extractions or boiling

495
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:51,080
or in some cases we also try and follow

496
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,650
the traditional means of extraction as

497
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,970
well these are then the solvents then

498
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,419
removed then we're working with these

499
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,700
crude extracts in our initial screens so

500
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:03,980
each extract from different plant

501
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,899
tissues may contain from several hundred

502
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:10,169
to up to a thousand different small

503
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:14,459
molecules so our current library is now

504
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:17,940
we have over 1200 extracts from plants

505
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,460
and fungi these also we have a pre

506
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,130
fractionated library on top of that on a

507
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,929
large chunk of these and I think what's

508
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,600
nice is that these are also highly

509
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,580
biologically diverse we have fifty fifty

510
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,778
one orders over four hundred species and

511
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:35,970
they cover I think a good spectrum of

512
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:38,480
plant diversity which gives us a unique

513
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,038
chance to then screen you know not just

514
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,889
1200 compounds we're probably actually

515
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:46,048
screening more in you know the scale of

516
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:50,849
a millions of compounds because each of

517
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:53,128
these is so diverse and complex so in

518
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,928
when we get to the microbiology lab some

519
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:56,759
of the classic ways that people have

520
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,460
looked at the anti bacterial potential

521
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,639
of medicinal plants has been following

522
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,350
our standard in the Box thought line we

523
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:07,439
need things that kill or inhibit the

524
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:08,459
growth of bacteria and across the board

525
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,929
the literature that's what you're going

526
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,879
to find if you look for antibacterial

527
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,320
activity of who to some plants you're

528
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:15,869
gonna see people that run these

529
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,028
microtiter broth assays which is

530
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,428
basically you have the bacteria growing

531
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:23,128
and culture and you look at optical

532
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:26,370
density to see if your compounds block

533
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:28,230
their growth or kill them you also might

534
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,548
see a lot of these distribution assays

535
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,038
where you basically have an auger dish

536
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:33,750
with compound on a disc or compound in

537
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,788
and well or extract in a while and you

538
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,490
look for zones of inhibition this is

539
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:41,128
this is the standard of where a lot of

540
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,528
work is done we also do this but I think

541
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:46,019
what is important as we go a step beyond

542
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:49,079
because I think a lot of the a lot of

543
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,009
the the rationale for why these plants

544
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,439
are being used in traditional medicine

545
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:54,450
is actually being missed this way it's

546
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,769
very easy to dismiss a traditional

547
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,399
medicine if you say oh this is used for

548
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:01,230
a skin infection but it doesn't kill any

549
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:03,119
of the bacteria that we know of that

550
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,490
cause skin infections so this is just an

551
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,829
old wives tale doesn't work it's junk

552
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,048
and I think that's been the perspective

553
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,668
a lot of scientists have taken in in in

554
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,898
this process in the past and so we're

555
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,090
really trying to make a push to

556
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:17,158
encourage people to think about other

557
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:19,439
potential mechanisms other pathways

558
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,830
where these compounds might actually be

559
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,140
working

560
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:24,599
so we're looking at pathways that are

561
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,240
involved in recalcitrants of infections

562
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,109
were long and during chronic kind of

563
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,880
wound infections

564
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:33,119
that's where biofilm comes into play

565
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,860
we're looking at compounds that inhibit

566
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,219
quorum sensing or bacterial

567
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:39,269
communication this is very important for

568
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,669
virulence factor production that's

569
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:43,500
responsible for tissue damage and we're

570
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:46,710
also looking for resistance modification

571
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,619
can these actually potentiate recents at

572
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,899
high as other classic and bacterials and

573
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,819
lastly there's also the host directed

574
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:55,979
impact and this is an area that we

575
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:58,259
haven't been working but I'm hoping to

576
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,240
find a strong immunologist collaborator

577
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,819
in the future to take on this angle

578
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,589
because we've been so focused on how

579
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:06,388
does it interact with the bug we have we

580
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:08,668
don't often think about how does it

581
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:10,408
actually interact with the host which

582
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,470
might provide some interesting insight

583
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,570
for medicine so in our approach for lead

584
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,210
identification we're starting with field

585
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:19,888
work or literature review we collect the

586
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,899
plan so we go through taxonomic

587
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:23,969
identification we're collecting plant

588
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:26,398
DNA to have these DNA bar-coded and

589
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:29,100
enter it into international databases we

590
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:30,839
are processing the materials in the

591
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,418
field and then going through this

592
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,599
process of bioassay guided fractionation

593
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,788
so at each step it's you have something

594
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,038
that's incredibly complex we get a hit

595
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:43,740
we separate using criminal matter

596
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,450
graphic techniques then go back retest

597
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,000
and keep trying to refine and refine it

598
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,440
I just had another me about our chestnut

599
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,440
project where we were getting so close

600
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,000
to identifying the active compounds and

601
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,850
I was very disappointed to find that

602
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,700
that one peak that we found and isolated

603
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:01,558
in a large quantity on our prep LC

604
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,470
actually turned out to be 5 compounds

605
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,690
still and it's like every time you get

606
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,038
closer and closer it's just like the set

607
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,320
of Russian dolls there's something else

608
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,240
there right but that's kind of also the

609
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,189
exciting part about this it's not an

610
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,980
easy approach but there's a lot there to

611
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:20,340
be discovered following bio asagaya

612
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,130
fractionation we also go to animal

613
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,288
studies we use a lot of mouse models we

614
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,179
can also use um Gloria Mellon ella

615
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:29,129
models which are basically these insect

616
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,480
models that you can use for looking at

617
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:35,970
pathogenesis for some of these packages

618
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,460
so I'm in a focus today on staph aureus

619
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,899
because we have a couple of examples of

620
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,360
different plants that interact with this

621
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:45,058
particular pathogen to give you some

622
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:48,359
background Staphylococcus aureus is in

623
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:50,519
the firm acute division of microbes it's

624
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,579
a leading cause of bacteremia and sepsis

625
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:57,870
brain abscess medical implanted device

626
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:59,788
infections we have new drugs again new

627
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:02,459
drugs that have been put out they're not

628
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:04,138
really new and if you talk to an

629
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,149
infectious disease doctor they don't

630
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,528
always work they work beautifully in a

631
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:09,959
test tube but when you're dealing with a

632
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:11,849
live patient these are incredibly

633
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,579
difficult infections in some cases to

634
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:18,119
treat especially for medical medical

635
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:19,829
device infections one thing of interest

636
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,928
is one in three of you actually carry

637
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:23,788
staph aureus and you're in your in your

638
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,870
nose and you're an Aries doesn't mean

639
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,819
that you're going to become sick from

640
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:29,089
this but it could lead to potential for

641
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:32,849
transmission to other people that are

642
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:34,589
perhaps more immune compromised there

643
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:37,199
are two different types of staph that

644
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:39,449
play an important role in health one is

645
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,909
known as H a and where s a or

646
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,288
healthcare-associated mr sa or that

647
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:45,059
stands for methicillin-resistant

648
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:48,000
Staphylococcus aureus this is a

649
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:49,798
resistant lineage that is associated

650
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,509
with infections of people that are

651
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,569
already sick in the hospital are there

652
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:57,058
for surgery or you know have some sort

653
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:59,819
of immune compromised State then there

654
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:03,329
is community associated M RSA which is a

655
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:06,839
new lineage that emerged in the past 15

656
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:08,099
to 20 years that allows this bug to

657
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,869
actually get into very healthy

658
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,788
individuals and I'll talk more about

659
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:14,518
that and how some these plant compounds

660
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:16,919
me play a role in that so let's start

661
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,888
with biofilm and this idea of intrinsic

662
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,559
resistance so biofilms can be either you

663
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:25,288
know microbial or polymicrobial these

664
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,388
occur in nature if you've ever looked at

665
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:30,629
a slimy rock in a stream that's the

666
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:33,538
slime is from a microbial biofilm these

667
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,880
are advantageous to microbes because it

668
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:37,798
provides them a safe haven and a place

669
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,679
where they can kind of work

670
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:43,888
cooperatively with each other so it

671
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,259
starts with initial adhesion to a

672
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,709
surface they grow into these mushroom

673
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,690
like

674
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,159
structures and through these channels

675
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,190
that you can see here that's where they

676
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,860
exchange genetic information so you have

677
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,230
much higher rates of genetic exchange in

678
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,579
these communities they also release

679
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,690
their waste products through those

680
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:06,000
channels and also take up nutrients

681
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:07,919
what's bad about the biofilm in terms of

682
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,409
the human host is that these are

683
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,000
incredibly difficult to clear once

684
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:14,640
they're in that Grove state they also in

685
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,009
to enter into slower metabolic rate so

686
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,830
they grow slower antibiotics work on

687
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,210
rapidly dividing cells it's also more

688
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:23,460
difficult for the antibiotics actually

689
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,409
penetrate that polysaccharide matrix

690
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,880
it's also difficult for your immune

691
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:32,640
system to clear that matrix as well so

692
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,200
let's go back to Italy this is from some

693
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,840
of my work I started off doing as a

694
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,058
graduate student documenting how people

695
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,980
in these rural villages for treating

696
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,690
skin and soft-tissue infections so I got

697
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,490
to go around and ask hundreds of people

698
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,399
questions about what did they put on

699
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,899
their skin for postulant using wounds I

700
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:51,178
mean it's a great conversation starter

701
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:53,489
right it's like so you remember that

702
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,840
time you have that nasty abscess with

703
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,179
all that stuff coming out what did you

704
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,490
do for that and I got a lot of really

705
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,250
interesting responses everything from

706
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,288
using slug slime to you know lots of

707
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,720
different plants and even some different

708
00:28:04,288 --> 00:28:07,859
industrial chemicals used in agriculture

709
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,589
I was like that sounds that could be

710
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:12,778
painful but this is one of those that

711
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:14,519
popped up and what was interesting is

712
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,028
that the they would actually take the

713
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,548
leaves and layer it with some aged pork

714
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:22,679
fat on the skin and they were also using

715
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:24,480
the roots to treat hair loss and this is

716
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,028
basically a large briar patch so it's

717
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,399
not easy to go in and collect they also

718
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:30,089
use the fruits and as edible for

719
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:33,839
marmalades

720
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:35,339
so we had there were over 116 different

721
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,418
remedies related to skin and soft-tissue

722
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:41,278
infections that we documented and this

723
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:45,330
is one that we collected now when I

724
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,669
looked at this in our in our models for

725
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:50,939
inhibition of growth does not inhibit

726
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,770
growth so again most people stopped at

727
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,960
that point when it came to evaluation of

728
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:57,179
antimicrobials but we went an additional

729
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,399
step and ask the question okay what

730
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,530
other potential processes does this

731
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:02,959
inter interact

732
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:06,079
so we use this assay it's a very simple

733
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,180
crystal violet assay where basically you

734
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,329
grow your organisms in your 96-well

735
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,400
plate when they form a biofilm under

736
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:15,019
certain media conditions basically

737
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,019
they'll form a layer at the bottom of

738
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,160
the well other organisms will form

739
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,559
they'll adhere to the kind of where that

740
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,630
air liquid interfaces but the staff

741
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,480
forms at the bottom and kind of around

742
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,630
the sides and so the question is if we

743
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,700
add these extracts to the wells as

744
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,860
they're trying to form the biofilm can

745
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,049
it stop them from forming and indeed we

746
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,369
found that it did and this is an image

747
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:41,990
from a confocal laser-scanning

748
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:43,579
microscopy some study where we have two

749
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,620
different strains of staph this is a

750
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:47,480
hospital strain taken from the

751
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:50,389
osteomyelitis patient so it's a bone

752
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,579
infection and this is a strain of one of

753
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,500
those more aggressive community acquired

754
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:57,740
infections found in blood streams of

755
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,589
healthy healthy individuals this is a

756
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,019
mutant that is basically does not form a

757
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:05,509
biofilm so when you add this this is at

758
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:07,940
different concentrations 220 df2 is our

759
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:09,700
refined version of the extract it's

760
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,019
enriched for content of ellagic acid

761
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,819
glycosides and we'll get to why that's

762
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,039
important in a moment but you can see

763
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:17,569
with dose-response and 100 micrograms

764
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:20,180
per mil there's basically no adhesion

765
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:23,419
this is a glass slide green shows growth

766
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,640
or live cells red as dead cells and a

767
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,950
healthy biofilm is composed of live and

768
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,259
dead cells but they're just not adhering

769
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,759
and here you have it 50 micrograms there

770
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,250
are some that are adhering but not many

771
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,569
and at 12 micrograms you can see that

772
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,319
some of them are a hearing but if you

773
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:41,179
look here this is a this is a way of

774
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:43,099
looking at it from the side view so you

775
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,660
can see the height of the towers you can

776
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:47,119
envision again those mushroom shaped

777
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,080
towers what happens is in the presence

778
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:53,119
of the drug they form these very tall

779
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,069
unstable towers so if you think about it

780
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,750
from the perspective of architecture if

781
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:59,419
you build a building too tall what

782
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:02,509
happens to it right so it's it's not as

783
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:05,150
fit of a structure and so our next

784
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:07,609
question is you know in the presence of

785
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,980
these compounds can we actually remove

786
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:12,379
an established biofilm that's the golden

787
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,069
question right if you have an implanted

788
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,560
device let's say you have your need

789
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:18,359
placement gets infected currently the

790
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,619
way that it's treated in the hospital is

791
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:21,929
the physicians going to put you under

792
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:24,000
high doses of antibiotics they're going

793
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,670
to go in and drain the pus because it's

794
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,069
red and large inflamed and oozy and pus

795
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,930
infection they're going to scrape it out

796
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:33,029
or debride it and then they have to

797
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,250
remove the device put in a temporary

798
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,690
device that's embedded with antibiotics

799
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,210
that will leach antibiotics into the

800
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,190
area for a while put you back on IV

801
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,140
antibiotics then after it looks like

802
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,059
you're healed they'll come back in take

803
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,980
the temporary device out put in a longer

804
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,990
term device now for some of these

805
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,930
procedures the recurrence rate of

806
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,240
infection is up to 40% those are not

807
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:57,000
good odds that's our current standard of

808
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,400
therapy so if we had ways to actually

809
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,819
prevent that biofilm from attaching in

810
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,590
the first place or actually treating a

811
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:06,779
patient that has this kind of infection

812
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,369
was something that eradicate sore

813
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,019
removes that biofilm with that out

814
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:12,269
actually having to remove the whole

815
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,980
device that's embedded in your bone that

816
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:15,690
would be great so that's the question we

817
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,670
asked here can we take these plant

818
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:23,100
compounds and remove that goopy biofilm

819
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,590
community from a device so this is just

820
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:27,059
a piece of IV catheter so the same kind

821
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:28,649
of IVs that go into your arm when you're

822
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,200
in the hospital we took one centimeter

823
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,030
segments grew the biofilm on it and then

824
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,340
treated it through a series of days in

825
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:37,910
different media continued either just

826
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:41,250
growth media the biofilm inhibitor alone

827
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:43,620
antibiotic alone or biofilm hitter plus

828
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,650
antibiotic now we are disappointed to

829
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,839
find that then blue is the biofilm

830
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,300
control and this is the biofilm

831
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,759
inhibitor and orange that we had no drop

832
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:55,950
and adhered cells when treating with

833
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,069
just the biofilm inhibitor right so it

834
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:01,259
wasn't able to remove the established

835
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:04,079
biofilm but if you look at the

836
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:06,119
antibiotic this is ten times the typical

837
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,549
dose of daptomycin it's ten times the

838
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,279
breakpoint m.i.c you only had a very

839
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:13,799
small this is not even quite 2 log drop

840
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,470
in adherent cells but what got us

841
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,419
excited is that when you combined the

842
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,329
inhibitor plus thing about it we saw a

843
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,400
large 5 log drop in tiered cells and

844
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:25,199
this is after seven days of treatment we

845
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,880
didn't completely clear the biofilm

846
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,870
but this gives you a sense of how

847
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,490
difficult these are

848
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:31,319
to treat right this is why do we have to

849
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,970
actually remove the device but this is

850
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,169
bringing a steps closer to thinking

851
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,360
about different ways to treat these

852
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,940
kinds of infections now within this

853
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,769
mixture this is a refined mixture we

854
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,799
knew that we had a logic acid in a bunch

855
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:45,450
of these glycosidic forms of it but we

856
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,599
found that each time that we try to

857
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:51,539
separate the extract past that point of

858
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,339
220 f2 we started losing activity and so

859
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,139
we recombined it in multiple different

860
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:57,959
ways we took our fractions and we

861
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,400
combined fraction 1 and 10 and 8 and 10

862
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,558
and all them together in all these

863
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,630
different myriad ways and the only way

864
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:05,670
we were able to restore the total

865
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,890
activity of 220 df2 is if we actually

866
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:13,050
put the entire thing back together of

867
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:14,128
220 f2 so this was a problem and for

868
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,230
those of you that do any natural

869
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:18,119
products isolation you know that I slay

870
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,230
enough of each individual compound from

871
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,168
the extract can be very time consuming

872
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,300
and difficult so I went down the hill to

873
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:26,908
a chemistry this is dr. Emily whiner and

874
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,470
I said you know can you just make these

875
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,539
for me because I don't know how to do

876
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,799
this and she said okay I didn't realize

877
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:34,230
at the time I was giving her a brick

878
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,300
right because ellagic acid has serious

879
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,550
solubility issues but she was able to do

880
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,500
this and she actually generated a number

881
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,929
of different glycosidic forms of the

882
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,940
ellagic acid and what we found from this

883
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,668
study was that the type of sugar did

884
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,490
matter we saw some enhanced um activity

885
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:52,230
with single compounds that had certain

886
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,898
kinds of sugars but what we found

887
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,969
overall again is that that enriched

888
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:59,130
botanical fraction that had a

889
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:03,119
composition of many different logic acid

890
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,460
glycosides was still the most active so

891
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,500
this was I think interesting and goes

892
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,289
back against this idea that I brought up

893
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,719
before the artemisinin is is actually

894
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:15,029
this enriched composition better than

895
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,409
going to a single drug in some cases we

896
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,600
also wanted to look and see what other

897
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:20,489
organisms does this work again so I did

898
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,739
this in collaboration with dr. Jorge

899
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:25,669
Vidale who's at Emory School of Public

900
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:28,559
Health and he's a he's an expert in

901
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,150
streptococcus pneumoniae and what we

902
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,360
found was strep pneumonia was very

903
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:37,320
interesting is that in this case 220 f2

904
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,930
actually did kill strep pneumonia and it

905
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,700
also broke up established biofilm so

906
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,019
that was really exciting that here

907
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,659
it actually behaves differently it's

908
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,190
another gram-positive caucus but it

909
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:49,469
behaves very differently than it does

910
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,530
with staph aureus so there's some

911
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:54,439
potential here also for other avenues of

912
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:58,400
development for strep pneumoniae

913
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,659
infections now let's get back to

914
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,039
community associated MRA and this is

915
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,500
where my quorum sensing work I think

916
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,099
really comes into play so this is an

917
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,019
epidemic

918
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,609
I mentioned that really shocked the

919
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:11,250
medical community and the public health

920
00:36:08,608 --> 00:36:13,259
officials because traditionally again

921
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,929
staff was something that affected sick

922
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,339
people or people had implant devices

923
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:20,250
then all of a sudden you started seeing

924
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:22,049
football players a military personnel

925
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,500
I'm talking about nineteen year old men

926
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:28,260
and the prime of health very fit very

927
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,650
you know immune stable that we're coming

928
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,510
down with these really severe infections

929
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,700
healthy one day and at death's door in a

930
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,410
few days I mean really serious kinds of

931
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:40,169
infections they often we present as a

932
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:43,348
skin infection in the ER in fact so

933
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,960
staph skin infections are very common in

934
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:47,670
the ER view they're often confused by

935
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,670
people as being spider bites you ever

936
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,400
see this kind of circular infection that

937
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,260
has a red hole in the middle that's not

938
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,980
a spider bite it's often it's staph

939
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:02,490
aureus kind of skin infection and in

940
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:05,369
most cases and that hole is caused by

941
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:08,519
these toxins that staph produces that

942
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:10,829
can cause this necrotic lesion so what

943
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,869
they found is you had this this this

944
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,030
severe sorts of infections we're

945
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:17,160
starting off and with the skin and then

946
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,839
moving systemically and infecting people

947
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,759
so what they did is they took these

948
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:21,929
strains here's a classic study where

949
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,550
they tried to replicate what they were

950
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:25,858
seeing in the clinic you had the

951
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,210
hospital strain if you injected that

952
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:28,858
into the bloodstream of the mouse the

953
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,889
mouse survived Matt mice are actually

954
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:33,960
quite good at fighting off staff if you

955
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:36,269
took one of these new community

956
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,970
associated strains you started to see

957
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:41,369
deaths in mice within a very short

958
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:42,779
amount of time so there is something

959
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:44,700
different that these bugs were doing

960
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,839
again this is not about drug resistance

961
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:51,029
this is about virulence staph exotoxins

962
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,799
which are part of that virulence package

963
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,040
are associated with a number of

964
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,200
different diseases

965
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,599
one of the classic ones is toxic shock

966
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:01,480
syndrome this was a big problem in a

967
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,150
period where you had women using super

968
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,949
absorbent tampons those were taken off

969
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,289
the market for the long-term use because

970
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:11,049
of this association you have scalded

971
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:13,329
skin syndrome and units this actually is

972
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,340
caused by exfoliated toxins that makes

973
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:17,440
the baby's skin fall off extremely

974
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,510
dangerous because of course you're

975
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,400
removing that important immune barrier

976
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,530
and can be opened up for additional

977
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,869
secondary infections and then the hall

978
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,730
markers abscesses necrosis and sepsis

979
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:30,130
and what's great about this from a

980
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,300
botany perspective again is that people

981
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,640
who describe this chimi

982
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,860
they can tell me I saw this on my skin

983
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,949
it was really gross it felt like this or

984
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,500
if it's a rash it spread it had fluid

985
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:43,389
the fluid was clear the fluid was was

986
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,980
postulant you can get a lot of

987
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:47,440
information from from visual

988
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,780
confirmation by people using plants for

989
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,659
these kinds of indications now what

990
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:57,010
makes this kind of staff so potent is

991
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:59,049
that it has this increased capacity to

992
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,910
release toxins and they actually use

993
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:06,550
this they use this capacity to recruit

994
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:08,170
neutrophils and basically are gobbled up

995
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,930
by the neutrophil once they're inside

996
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,180
they release a burst of toxin and

997
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:15,339
actually actively attack your immune

998
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:16,899
system this is what makes them able to

999
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,070
get into the bloodstream from these skin

1000
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,110
infections and spread throughout the

1001
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,970
body and a much more effective way than

1002
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:25,930
the other classic hospital-associated

1003
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:28,899
once did so when I was in doing my PhD

1004
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:30,819
work there was a lot of talk by folks at

1005
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,410
NIH like Michael Otto had a lot of

1006
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,880
really interesting papers that were more

1007
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,980
opinion papers and kind of

1008
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,079
forward-thinking papers what if we could

1009
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,599
come up with drugs to target this system

1010
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,519
of communication that controls virulence

1011
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,719
and it was always the big what-if in

1012
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,449
their appeal they were working on some

1013
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:48,429
peptide signaling agents inhibitors and

1014
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:50,379
I at the time of course was working on

1015
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:52,089
these postulant wounds and I'm thinking

1016
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,760
well maybe this is a way that could

1017
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,519
explain how some of these work in the

1018
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,560
clinic and so I end up with dr. poore as

1019
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,349
well who's an expert in the accessory

1020
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:04,420
gene regulator system and staff and he

1021
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:06,618
was able to build a number of tools that

1022
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,349
we use to assess these the

1023
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,059
these compounds so the idea here is to

1024
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,400
use a quorum quenching approach we're

1025
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:15,309
not actually killing the organism but

1026
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,869
limiting its ability to communicate

1027
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:20,900
either through releasing signals or

1028
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:24,048
receiving signals this is what the

1029
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,150
system looks like so you have a constant

1030
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:28,068
release of these Auto inducing peptides

1031
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:32,180
into the cells extracellular environment

1032
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:34,278
and these are recognized here by a GRC

1033
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:36,889
this triggers a phosphorylation event

1034
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:39,159
and then downstream you have a

1035
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:41,719
production of a number of different

1036
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,759
toxins including super antigen Saito

1037
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,098
license things that can burst open

1038
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:48,920
immune cells red blood cells degrade

1039
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,930
your tissue and also help get past that

1040
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,630
skin barrier this is really important

1041
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:55,940
for the skin barrier function so in

1042
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,160
dermatology we're always concerned with

1043
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,740
skin barrier function if you lose that

1044
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,048
that that shield of your skin if your

1045
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:06,318
skin barrier is degraded in any way it

1046
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:08,538
opens you up for invasion by not only

1047
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,460
staff but other pathogens are in the

1048
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:13,489
environment it also opens you up to more

1049
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:16,460
contact with allergens in the

1050
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:18,559
environment so this is relevant for

1051
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,999
diseases also like eczema I don't know

1052
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,640
if any of you are familiar with eczema

1053
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:24,318
about 20% of kids in the US and other

1054
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,259
developed countries deal with eczema or

1055
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:29,150
atopic dermatitis and staff is heavily

1056
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:31,068
involved in that disease as well because

1057
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,559
of its role in impacting skin barrier

1058
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:36,788
function and causing itch through mast

1059
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,710
cell degranulation and histamine release

1060
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:41,960
so let's go back to Italy again here's

1061
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,699
another case where we dog-human that the

1062
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,389
use of chestnut this is just your

1063
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:47,868
standard

1064
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:50,808
castaigne sativa standard chestnut grown

1065
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:53,599
across Europe for its fruits for its

1066
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:55,940
edible fruits and we had documentation

1067
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,430
of local people using the leaves of

1068
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:02,480
chestnut as an anti-inflammatory agent

1069
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:04,518
for inflammatory skin disease much like

1070
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,639
what you would see in a classic eczema

1071
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:09,738
patient and so again we look at this

1072
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,900
plant found it did not inhibit the

1073
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:15,730
growth of bacteria it doesn't really do

1074
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:19,079
much on biofilm but it does inhibit this

1075
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:23,338
signaling system and staph aureus

1076
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:25,469
so by taking these we basically in some

1077
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:27,328
of these sites we grew the bacteria and

1078
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:29,940
the presence of the plant extract and

1079
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:31,829
then looked at the damage that the cells

1080
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,380
supernatant this is basically the waste

1081
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:35,459
products of the bacteria we put onto

1082
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,709
human cells

1083
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,449
so the waste product would normally

1084
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:41,489
contain a lot of these toxins that are

1085
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:42,958
excreted from the cell so if you put

1086
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:44,400
that on to a cell line you're going to

1087
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,958
see all of your cells are just going to

1088
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,269
die and we're working with human skin

1089
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:50,489
cells so those skin cells die and the

1090
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:52,288
ones that were pre treated though with

1091
00:42:50,489 --> 00:42:55,019
our extract we found that they were

1092
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:56,670
protected because there's no toxin in

1093
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:58,139
that supernatant

1094
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,180
right because you're turning off their

1095
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:02,159
ability to release toxin so we wanted to

1096
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:04,588
see how this works in an animal so in

1097
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,629
this model you have this is a little

1098
00:43:04,588 --> 00:43:09,028
mouse sorry for you that get disturbed

1099
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,068
by animal images but here's a little

1100
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:13,409
mouse we take one of those nasty

1101
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:15,630
community associate mrs a strains that

1102
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:17,338
affects healthy people inject it into

1103
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,459
the skin dermis so it's an intradermal

1104
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:22,469
intradermal injection and you can see

1105
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:26,159
that after two days this big necrotic

1106
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:29,190
lesions occurs so by release of toxins

1107
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:33,629
the staff is degrading the skin okay now

1108
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:35,909
we tried to then at the same time as we

1109
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:39,119
give the bacteria we also give them a

1110
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:41,518
small dose of the chestnut extract this

1111
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,979
is a refined extract again of Earth

1112
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:47,608
scene and all you mean derivatives okay

1113
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:49,739
and if five micrograms you see a small

1114
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:51,568
much smaller lesion but it still forms

1115
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:54,269
and at 50 micrograms

1116
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:56,130
there's no lesion formation but you can

1117
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:58,348
see this little pocket right remember

1118
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,509
this is not an antibiotic it's not

1119
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:02,548
actually killing the bugs the bugs are

1120
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:04,380
still there but it's you've just

1121
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:05,969
completely disarmed them so it's a

1122
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,709
different way of thinking about how do

1123
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:09,778
you fight your enemy I'm a big fan of

1124
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:11,009
Sun Tzu's Art of War right I think we

1125
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:12,958
did think more about that when we think

1126
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:15,208
about how to better manage infectious

1127
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:18,149
disease you know can you disarm your

1128
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:20,219
enemy by by other means so the bacteria

1129
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,579
is still there it just can't cause any

1130
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:25,588
damage and an immune competent organism

1131
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:29,278
you can then clear out that infection

1132
00:44:25,588 --> 00:44:31,108
right so let's go forward to another

1133
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:32,099
story this is a Brazilian pepper tree

1134
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:35,318
this is our Maurice

1135
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:38,318
publication and in Brazilian pepper tree

1136
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:40,568
this is a plant that is shyest Herman

1137
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,998
thief olya is in the antic RDA see so

1138
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:45,099
this is relative of mango and poison ivy

1139
00:44:42,998 --> 00:44:48,278
very important in traditional medicine

1140
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:50,079
in South America especially in Brazilian

1141
00:44:48,278 --> 00:44:52,028
medicine and there's been a lot of

1142
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,798
records of many different ways it was

1143
00:44:52,028 --> 00:44:56,108
used and a lot of different cases of

1144
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:57,938
infectious disease on the fruits who are

1145
00:44:56,108 --> 00:45:00,159
understudied though I found in the

1146
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:01,928
literature and so we decided to go and

1147
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,458
collect some now luckily I'm from this

1148
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:06,309
part of Florida you can see why I'm not

1149
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:08,978
used to cold I'm from here this is by my

1150
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:11,769
County I took some students down and we

1151
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:13,268
went collected more of of the the fruits

1152
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:15,788
and leaves and different tissues at the

1153
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:17,468
plant because it's a it's an invasive

1154
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:19,630
species in Florida it's a noxious weed

1155
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:21,818
there are actually big programs that are

1156
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:23,949
geared towards removal of this plant so

1157
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:27,159
hated plant which is kind of kind of an

1158
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:29,289
underdog story for me so in the in the

1159
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:32,379
chemistry lab we take that extract we

1160
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,150
had a basic methanol at crude extract we

1161
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,619
then undergo liquid liquid partitioning

1162
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,689
these are basically two standard ways of

1163
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:40,599
separating compounds based on polarity

1164
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:43,358
then go to flash chromatography and we

1165
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,489
can go on to prep or semi prep and so on

1166
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,828
to isolate compounds so you can see at

1167
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:50,769
each stage here's the crude extract as

1168
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:54,390
we enrich it or as we work on those more

1169
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:56,768
active parts you can see and you have

1170
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:59,498
greater concentration of these active

1171
00:45:56,768 --> 00:46:01,149
compounds so in our assays I want to

1172
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:03,669
just show you a few examples we have a

1173
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:06,278
reporter system there are four types of

1174
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,409
signaling systems and staff of four

1175
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:10,748
different peptides of that AG are

1176
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:12,639
releases so we have reporters for each

1177
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:14,108
of those we wanted to control closely

1178
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,818
for growth so we found it's not

1179
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:18,278
inhibiting growth any of these reporters

1180
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:21,869
but it is blocking their ability to

1181
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:25,358
signal or communicate between each other

1182
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:27,969
again in our mouse model we saw that you

1183
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:30,458
have your lesion with at this case with

1184
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:32,108
50 microgram injection not as effective

1185
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:34,568
as a chestnut but again you see the same

1186
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:36,818
kind of activity of blocking that

1187
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:40,420
necrotic pathway we also for the first

1188
00:46:36,818 --> 00:46:43,028
time showed this in the live model using

1189
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,940
a fluorescent reporter strains in the

1190
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:48,280
live mouse that we are in the mouse

1191
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,659
in this specific gene system to help

1192
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,250
prevent necrotic Legion formation now

1193
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:56,769
for those of you this is this is what

1194
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,559
we're working with this is a clean clean

1195
00:46:56,769 --> 00:47:01,088
version of the extract plant extracts

1196
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:03,759
are of course incredibly chemically

1197
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:06,039
complex and we're now focused on trying

1198
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:10,359
to isolate these individually through

1199
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:12,519
prep chromatography to then do more work

1200
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:14,769
to understand which of these compounds

1201
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:16,449
are involved and again thinking about

1202
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:18,880
this question of do they work better

1203
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:20,529
together one of my main concerns if you

1204
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,338
go back to these four different AGR

1205
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:26,710
signaling peptides is you know it might

1206
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:29,019
it might be that the mixture works

1207
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,108
better overall because it's very

1208
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:33,818
difficult you're not going to have a

1209
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:35,289
position AGR type your infection they're

1210
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:37,329
going to say is it staph or not I'm not

1211
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:39,068
going to go beyond that so I think it

1212
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:41,410
could be advantageous to have a mixture

1213
00:47:39,068 --> 00:47:42,579
that targets all four types I think what

1214
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:44,019
else was interesting is that we showed

1215
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:47,019
that this does not inhibit growth of

1216
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:48,338
your skin commensals right so you one of

1217
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:51,369
the challenges in antibiotic development

1218
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:53,170
is that while we're hitting these nasty

1219
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,730
bugs the same time we're also killing

1220
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,050
all of your commensal organisms this is

1221
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:58,329
why we have big issues with c diff

1222
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,310
infections and the gut when you clear

1223
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:02,410
out your healthy commensal system so

1224
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:06,130
we've found in skin organisms at least

1225
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:09,219
with the exception of acne this does not

1226
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:11,108
inhibit growth some of the different

1227
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,059
targets we're working on are again

1228
00:48:11,108 --> 00:48:15,670
looking at two atopic dermatitis

1229
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:17,858
acute bacterial and skin and soft-tissue

1230
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,869
infections and I'm actually thinking

1231
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:23,619
more broadly now also towards veterinary

1232
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:26,440
medicine because atopic infections and

1233
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,700
dogs is actually also quite common so

1234
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,500
we're thinking about a doggy cream

1235
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:31,059
formulation for this as well as maybe

1236
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,010
the first place to start because the

1237
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:35,019
hurdles to getting this into a clinical

1238
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:38,260
study in dogs are much lower than going

1239
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:40,858
to humans as a first strain place I want

1240
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,569
to talk just briefly about this one last

1241
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:45,130
plant of st. John's wort you've all

1242
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:48,429
probably heard of this it's Hypericum

1243
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:52,059
for freedom it's used in the Balkans as

1244
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:56,169
a interesting way they actually create a

1245
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:58,719
Sun oil infusion of the flowering aerial

1246
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,860
parts so when you go to your standard

1247
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:01,419
health

1248
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,570
store you don't find that kind of

1249
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:06,220
formulation you see they have organic

1250
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:08,950
extracts they're sold either in liquid

1251
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:10,959
or tablet form and again mainly used for

1252
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:13,089
mental health rather than infectious

1253
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,010
disease but what we document in our

1254
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:18,100
studies over and over in the Balkans is

1255
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:20,710
that this particular formulation it's

1256
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:22,420
locally known as Pantheon is incredibly

1257
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:25,690
important for the treatment management

1258
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:28,240
of skin disease and one of my things I

1259
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,200
was worried about is that the presence

1260
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,779
of hypericin

1261
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,279
in the dietary supplement tablets can

1262
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,790
actually cause a disease called high

1263
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,290
parasitism which is a photoreactive skin

1264
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:40,840
disease basically you're more

1265
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:43,570
susceptible to getting sunburned easily

1266
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,950
when you have this in your diet so my

1267
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:46,240
question is here we have these people

1268
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,339
that are rubbing this all over their

1269
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,169
skin all the time and yet there were no

1270
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,750
reports of high parasitism there were no

1271
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:55,389
reports of skin photo reactivity and so

1272
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,920
my question was is it because their

1273
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:59,319
formulae in a different way that they

1274
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,329
actually are at lower risk now the major

1275
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,360
a bacterial compound here is hypericin

1276
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:06,069
and hyperforin also has some

1277
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,590
antibacterial activity this is the

1278
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:12,850
compound that causes that photo reactive

1279
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:14,650
side effect so this was actually a study

1280
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,750
done by one of my undergraduates I

1281
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,099
really love working with undergrads in a

1282
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,480
lab I try and get students when they

1283
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,219
start at sophomores and they work with

1284
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,460
me all the way through senior year so

1285
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:26,349
he's a co first author on this paper and

1286
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,480
what he did is he went and collect gots

1287
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:30,880
different tablets from supplement stores

1288
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,110
and then also worked with the plant

1289
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,090
materials that we collected in the

1290
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:36,370
Balkans as well as the traditional

1291
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:38,829
formulation of this prepared in olive

1292
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:40,480
oil or in sunflower oil and what we

1293
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:43,150
found is that when you look at growth

1294
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,010
inhibition the tablets and supplements

1295
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,260
and even the aqueous of methanol

1296
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:50,050
extracts were potently antibacterial

1297
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:53,380
that they also had very high levels of

1298
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:55,090
hypericin whereas the oils really didn't

1299
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,510
have much antibacterial activity so

1300
00:50:55,090 --> 00:51:01,269
again traditional medicine but is not

1301
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:03,400
killing staph or any of these skin

1302
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:04,960
bacteria that caused this disease so

1303
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,940
then we looked at quorum sensing we saw

1304
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,449
it did have some moderate quorum

1305
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,789
quenching activity in the oils so that

1306
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:14,049
might be one potential explanation for

1307
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:16,389
why this works

1308
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:19,510
and when we looked at the chromatograms

1309
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:21,009
of through mass spec evaluating each of

1310
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:24,130
these formulations what we found across

1311
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:28,480
the board again is that the oils lacked

1312
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:30,849
the presence of of hypericin so these

1313
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,369
are dead lacking the toxic compound and

1314
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:37,509
not eliciting a standard antibacterial

1315
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:39,369
activity but have some mild aunt a

1316
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:41,380
quorum sensing activity as well as some

1317
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:43,420
mild anti biofilm activity i didn't show

1318
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,030
that data so i'm going to wrap up here

1319
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,559
and just say that you know i think that

1320
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:49,120
one of the things that we can do in the

1321
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,360
plant science is is to think more

1322
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,069
broadly also concerning again this idea

1323
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,110
of signaling in the in the environment

1324
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,400
plants are signaling with organisms in

1325
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:00,730
their environment for their own survival

1326
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,559
in some cases we also have crossover

1327
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,110
with targets into human pathogens i

1328
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,699
think this is a an interesting area to

1329
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,380
work and i think again that traditional

1330
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:10,119
medicine can help us to focus in on

1331
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,269
those species that are most likely to

1332
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:16,599
have some kind of interference with with

1333
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:18,159
the human pathogens our work we also i

1334
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,170
didn't get a chance to talk about the

1335
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,539
other targets we also have some really

1336
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,639
cool projects ongoing right now with

1337
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:26,230
collaborators on zika virus we found a

1338
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,359
really potent inhibitor of replication

1339
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:30,630
for zika we're also working on some of

1340
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,579
these superbugs fungus infections like

1341
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,619
canada ours from some of our plants so

1342
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:40,059
these are not yet published but will be

1343
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:41,829
hopefully soon and i just want to wrap

1344
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:44,199
up with you know can we look beyond

1345
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:46,599
these old paradigms of kill kill kill i

1346
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,609
think that as we come to the end of the

1347
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,799
antibiotic era we have to think about

1348
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:52,300
paradigm shifts in medicine and a role

1349
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,010
that some of these different again

1350
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,380
signaling inhibitors might play in

1351
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,960
managing disease in the future so these

1352
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,140
are where i'll end and thank you and how

1353
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:09,320
far we've got for questions

1354
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:09,319
[Applause]

1355
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:17,429
Sarris probably a lot more microbiology

1356
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:30,690
than you guys were hoping for in a plant

1357
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:34,500
like Kim in the bacterias all day but

1358
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:45,960
just quenching the virus and do you

1359
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:48,420
think that's I think I think that's

1360
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,309
exactly right I mean there's that's the

1361
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,220
other kind of thing that everyone wants

1362
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:54,750
is the resistance proof drug now I think

1363
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,358
it depends on whether or not you have

1364
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,639
additional selective pressures at play

1365
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,139
perhaps resistance could evolve I think

1366
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:02,730
it's less likely than the direct

1367
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:04,710
selective pressures that we have with

1368
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,568
classic antibiotics so we've actually

1369
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,889
done a lot of resistant studies with

1370
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:10,650
these drugs we've done a lot of cereal

1371
00:54:07,889 --> 00:54:13,139
packaging basically growing these in the

1372
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,660
presence of of the warm winters over

1373
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:18,900
generations and have not found any drop

1374
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:21,298
in their ability to quench signaling now

1375
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,309
that was in the absence of an of an

1376
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:24,809
additional selective pressure so what

1377
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:26,819
would be optimal is if we could do this

1378
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:28,230
in an animal model we've been thinking

1379
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:30,358
about ways to do this perhaps in

1380
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,740
gallery' ml NL and the insect model so

1381
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:33,119
we could then pass it through

1382
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:34,858
generations of insects and that's

1383
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:40,710
something that we have on them we have

1384
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:43,768
on the horizon you see or have you tried

1385
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:48,838
to see gistic effects of your

1386
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:53,399
combination of plants so making a

1387
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:56,548
formula different plants we have not you

1388
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:01,019
know something a film that effect quorum

1389
00:54:56,548 --> 00:55:03,659
sensing and see if we haven't done that

1390
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:05,969
yet we've focused mainly on combinations

1391
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:08,548
with existing antibiotics but that could

1392
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:10,618
be an interesting thing to do I guess

1393
00:55:08,548 --> 00:55:12,509
but the reason I haven't really done it

1394
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:14,338
is more from a translational perspective

1395
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:17,278
it's already really difficult to get an

1396
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:19,480
IND going on these when you have you

1397
00:55:17,278 --> 00:55:20,650
know through the botanical drug pathway

1398
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,719
for these I think if I'm combining

1399
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:25,690
different extracts that's not

1400
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,309
permissible under that pathway but from

1401
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:47,289
a kind of an inquiry standpoint that

1402
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:48,639
could be interesting I mean I think that

1403
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:50,259
traditional Chinese medicine is

1404
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,059
incredibly complex and you can spend a

1405
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,500
lifetime studying it in fact people do

1406
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:55,119
it's um

1407
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,590
I think there are a lot of interesting

1408
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,440
bioactive ingredients used in

1409
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:01,030
traditional Chinese medicine but to

1410
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,070
study it with the tools that we have

1411
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:04,780
today you would need to really look at

1412
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:08,140
perhaps single plant tissues to start

1413
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,310
off with but in the future as we

1414
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:11,319
advanced kind of these different

1415
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:12,730
metabolomics approaches perhaps there

1416
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,670
are better ways to study the complex

1417
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:17,619
mixtures one of the problems with with

1418
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,360
with some of these forms of medicine is

1419
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:21,579
you know or if you're able to actually

1420
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:23,170
collect the fresh plant as a botanist I

1421
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:26,019
always like emphasize actual

1422
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:27,190
identification of the species and so if

1423
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:29,079
you go into a traditional Chinese

1424
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,909
medicine shop there are lots of dried

1425
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:32,650
bits of plants and roots and leaves and

1426
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:36,250
like well it's difficult to ensure that

1427
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:39,220
you have the correct species that you're

1428
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,469
working on yeah but I think it's a

1429
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:43,269
fascinating area I'm like I already deal

1430
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:46,569
in so much complexity though the idea of

1431
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:48,400
working on ingredients that involve you

1432
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,410
know ingredients from five different

1433
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,960
species and different tissues into one

1434
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:55,889
formulation is just beyond my capacity

1435
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:03,579
to deal with right now

1436
00:56:55,889 --> 00:57:06,579
okay thank you so much this has been a
