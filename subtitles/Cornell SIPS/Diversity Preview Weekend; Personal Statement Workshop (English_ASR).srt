1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,410
University welcome to the personal

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,730
statement workshop my name is Erin

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,650
Larson and I'm a fifth year PhD

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,620
candidate in ecology and evolutionary

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,240
biology and I am cinnamon I'm a fourth

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:20,759
year student yeah and so we'll be

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,229
talking a little bit today and I'll talk

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,519
about what we'll actually be doing

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,019
during the personal statement workshop

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,028
but we'll spend about 15 minutes talking

12
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,459
to you guys about personal statements

13
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:32,219
generally and then we'll break out into

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,049
our small groups where we'll talk about

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,850
the personal statements that we read for

16
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:41,218
you guys sorry I'm gonna try and then we

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,510
will also have you guys do some peer

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,129
editing with each other while you're

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,729
trading off talking with your grad

20
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,530
student editors and so to start with I

21
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,198
think a personal statement is one of the

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,520
most mysterious black box II parts of a

23
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,689
grad school application it's the part

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,129
where you're like what exactly am I

25
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,198
supposed to say here what am I supposed

26
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,000
to do and so we wanted to unpack a

27
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,469
little bit what exactly a personal

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,448
statement is I know you guys wrote one

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,920
for DPW you probably have written some

30
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,280
if you've been applying for grad schools

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,570
this past year but generally a personal

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,640
statement is somewhere between two to

33
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,618
four pages long depends on the school

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,150
follow the instructions they give you

35
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,920
for length and formatting and things

36
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,650
like that but it's really an opportunity

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,359
for you to expand on your CV so all

38
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,400
those sentences that you want to write

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,959
about the different jobs you had the

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,060
different experiences you had some

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,709
things that you didn't get to put on

42
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,210
your CV if you want to explain why you

43
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,789
took some time off before going to

44
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,589
undergrad why you switch schools the

45
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,439
personal statements a great place to

46
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,210
kind of explain your CV it's also a

47
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,819
chance for you to show your voice and

48
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,438
your personality and who you are um and

49
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,679
it's more of a picture of you as both a

50
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,599
person and a researcher um that said

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,189
it's not necessarily a place to tell

52
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,929
them everything that you like to do in

53
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,059
your spare time unless it's really

54
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,030
related to how that would help you

55
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,829
succeed in grad school I mean it's also

56
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,939
a way to show that you're resilient that

57
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:01,859
you have grit that you're gonna have

58
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,099
what it takes to make it through the

59
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:08,219
long long road that it is that is a PhD

60
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,139
or a master's degree and so in terms of

61
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,259
structure there's sort of a general

62
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,658
structure that we'll talk about here

63
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,669
but it also might depend on the prompts

64
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:17,840
that you get given by a specific school

65
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,369
that you're applying to sometimes

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,890
they'll give you some really specific

67
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,780
directions of what they want to see in a

68
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:24,979
personal statement but very generally

69
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,449
you obviously want to have an

70
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,030
introduction so you want to have some

71
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:30,649
sort of narrative hook one example of a

72
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,019
hook might be an anecdote from your

73
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,269
childhood or from and sometime in your

74
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,060
lifetime that about why you decided you

75
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,739
want to study biology but keep that

76
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,969
pretty short and sweet because they're

77
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,840
really what you want to be able to get

78
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:47,209
into is your recent past in terms of

79
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,859
sort of the post high school your

80
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,079
influential classes your mentors your

81
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:52,790
research experiences and then into your

82
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,769
future so you want to make sure that

83
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,969
you're also forward-looking as you move

84
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,769
towards the end of that personal

85
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,750
statement so you're talking about why

86
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,560
you want to go to grad school

87
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,848
specifically why you want to go to grad

88
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,289
school at that particular place that

89
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,358
you're applying to and why it's a good

90
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:06,828
fit for you and then you want to sort of

91
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,900
wrap it all up with some sort of

92
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:12,560
forward-looking summary statement or

93
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,030
conclusion and so it can be a little

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,859
overwhelming to get started you guys

95
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,299
already have done that though you

96
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:19,250
already have something that you can work

97
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,599
with and edit but you want to make sure

98
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,889
that you know your audience you only

99
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:23,628
know the department that you're applying

100
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,489
to what are they looking for what a

101
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:27,768
professor is doing there what's the

102
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,120
school like is it a more agriculturally

103
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,459
focused school is it a school that

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,230
focuses more on theoretical biology

105
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,878
something like that and you also want to

106
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:36,649
know the strengths and resources it has

107
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,289
and why you want to go there and what

108
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,870
about it is drawing you there especially

109
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,759
like we mentioned before if they ask you

110
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,039
specific questions to address you want

111
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,959
to make sure that you hit those in your

112
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,578
personal statement and then you also

113
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,229
want to think about what have been your

114
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,689
influential experiences what's driving

115
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:56,000
you to want to study biology and to want

116
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,408
to go to graduate school and you can

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,199
really shape your outline around those

118
00:03:57,408 --> 00:04:01,848
and then you'll finally craft a clear

119
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,329
main message with supporting information

120
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:08,000
which is just as easy as it sounds but

121
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,500
and what we'll talk about too a little

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,449
bit is how to actually kick it up a

123
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,930
notch so how to make sure that your

124
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:16,038
personal statement really shines one

125
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,629
thing to do is to make sure that you

126
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,459
tailor each of your personal statements

127
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:22,939
to each school so you can have sort of

128
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,038
your modular personal statement that

129
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,819
you've crafted but then make sure that

130
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:29,539
your

131
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:31,670
and you're liking it into school that

132
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,379
you're applying to and that means

133
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,939
thinking about specifically naming

134
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:36,230
professors possibly that you're excited

135
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,569
about working with our specific

136
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,620
resources at each of those schools and

137
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,199
you also want to make sure that this

138
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,120
piece of this document is in

139
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,889
conversation with your research

140
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,870
statement too so that doesn't mean that

141
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,849
they totally overlap but you can mention

142
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,079
some of the same experiences that you

143
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,850
mentioned in your research statement but

144
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,349
maybe go more into depth about how they

145
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,660
developed you as a person and as a

146
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,810
researcher rather than specifically the

147
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,340
research that you did um also make sure

148
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,509
that you get feedback on this this is

149
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,419
gonna be an opportunity for you guys to

150
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:08,959
get lots of feedback and but send it to

151
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,520
friends family professors mentors the

152
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,569
more feedback and more drafts you can go

153
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,389
through the better and cinnamon we'll

154
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:16,579
talk a little bit about how helpful that

155
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,500
feedback can be I'm really light you

156
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,149
shine through and don't be afraid to

157
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,290
have some of your voice your personal

158
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:24,139
experiences that you feel comfortable

159
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,819
sharing and really be the hero of your

160
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,889
own story it can be a little hard to

161
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:31,659
want to toot your own horn but this is

162
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:34,819
the place to really be the active

163
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,260
participant in your narrative and make

164
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,269
sure that you give yourself lots of time

165
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,310
to actually go through all these drafts

166
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:42,349
and editing so even though this seems

167
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,600
like maybe the thing that you want to do

168
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,070
last when you're doing your applications

169
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,300
for grad school make sure you leave

170
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,819
yourself plenty of time to actually

171
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,400
focus on this but you guys are in great

172
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,079
shape for

173
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,000
so now cinnamon is going to take us

174
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:58,439
through a motivating real-life example

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,029
of a personal statement

176
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,550
so what I'm going to show you is

177
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:07,539
actually two versions of personal

178
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,270
statement and for the GRS P and which is

179
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,030
a graduate research fellowship program

180
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:15,250
and so the first version was not

181
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:18,099
successful I did not get the fellowship

182
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,720
the second version was and I think the

183
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,550
thing that changed the most in my

184
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,199
application packet was actually my

185
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,879
personal statement and so I'm going to

186
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
take us through what I change between

187
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,850
the first and second time that I applied

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,770
okay and so just first some overall tips

189
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,600
and so I'm going to tell you these tips

190
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,310
and then give you some concrete examples

191
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,760
so something that's really important is

192
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,319
to be space conscious and then also you

193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,089
don't have to try to fit in every life

194
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,918
experience it is a personal statement

195
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,579
but they don't need to know every step

196
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,189
of your whole life

197
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:50,139
it's okay to editorialize I'm also

198
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:53,319
avoiding vague freezing which I'll get

199
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,000
more into you avoiding cliches showing

200
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,009
and not telling so it's one thing to say

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,769
oh I love biology it's another thing to

202
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,389
show that you love biology and then last

203
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:03,519
as erin was saying it's really really

204
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,168
important to get help editing and so

205
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,269
this difference between the first and

206
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:08,889
second versions wasn't just like me like

207
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:10,449
sitting in my office like thinking about

208
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,879
how I can make it better a lot of it

209
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,189
with suggestions that I got from mentors

210
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,589
and other students that we're applying

211
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:21,879
for this grant okay

212
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:23,319
and so this is the overall intro and so

213
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,079
you can see in draft one it's pretty

214
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,348
long and the second one I actually ended

215
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,689
up deleting an entire paragraph and and

216
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:34,089
so the first thing I deleted and so it's

217
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:35,769
really tempting to start with a summary

218
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:37,269
of what you're going to talk about in

219
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,370
your essay but most of these are pretty

220
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,439
short two or three pages so you don't

221
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,939
need a summary upfront and it can be

222
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,649
helpful to start with the summary just

223
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:49,660
to orient yourself but you don't need to

224
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:52,810
have this and the second thing that I

225
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,570
cut a lot out of was tracking my exact

226
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,598
story through college so I started off

227
00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:00,218
in a different major and then I was like

228
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:01,810
oh I want to study cancer and now I

229
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:03,908
don't I'm gonna study plants and I'm

230
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,978
gonna say frogs and if that doesn't all

231
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:08,199
need to go in here

232
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:11,199
so you can just so this is everything I

233
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,449
did I changed this to one sentence so

234
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,340
it's okay to like have a winding path

235
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:20,080
that you don't need to recapitulate it

236
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:21,788
here and something else that I did a lot

237
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,180
definitely when I first started writing

238
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:26,949
and that I've seen in some of the essays

239
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,168
that I was looking through um is like

240
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:32,110
this really big in cliche opening

241
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:35,710
sentence and this is actually taken like

242
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,570
from my from my actual essay so a lot of

243
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,729
people will have some version of Oh from

244
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,159
an early age I was like trumping in the

245
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,709
puns or like interested in nature like

246
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:49,708
you know whatever but like everyone will

247
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:52,088
say this so don't so don't see that so

248
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,588
and then this like second example so

249
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,630
these are all sentences from the first

250
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,339
version um so that's like early

251
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,600
engagement in nature which sounds really

252
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:00,910
great but it's like what does that even

253
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,759
mean I don't know like what was I doing

254
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:06,309
and then the last one is this

255
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:11,970
fascination which led me to study the

256
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:11,969
biology also this fascination pretty big

257
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,028
okay and so this is probably like the

258
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,850
biggest change that I made in my

259
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:20,980
personal statement so Aaron mentioned a

260
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,750
little bit the narrative hook and this

261
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,639
is where you're really doing the showing

262
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,379
and not telling and this idea actually

263
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,539
wasn't my idea somebody else who had

264
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,879
gotten the GFP read my drafting was like

265
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:32,679
oh yeah this is nice but like your first

266
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,980
draft is really big and could you give

267
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:39,669
some sort of like anecdote um so you can

268
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,110
see this first draft and be up in a

269
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,149
rural setting blah blah blah

270
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,669
lots of people have that and then I

271
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:48,610
changed it into like more this story

272
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:53,588
which I could read to you or I can give

273
00:09:48,610 --> 00:10:00,940
you a second to read okay so I did this

274
00:09:53,589 --> 00:10:04,199
dramatic okay and all right so here's my

275
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,440
final intro to my dear a few thousand

276
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:10,958
nine pm I'm lying on my stomach it's six

277
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,290
inches of stinky gooey pine muck and

278
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,838
peering down a dark drainage pipe the

279
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:19,689
hunched forms of Ranikhet Vienna the

280
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,290
American bullfrog visible but beyond my

281
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,510
reach a foot to your left I call to my

282
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,698
field he was attempting to startle the

283
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,500
frogs down the pipe of the pole she

284
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:32,740
Pat's one of the frogs and it hops into

285
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,659
my range hammering I lunged to sweep it

286
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,610
into my net I got it

287
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:39,610
I stand triumphant grinning ear-to-ear

288
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,250
mission accomplished this is not a story

289
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,110
from my most recent field season this is

290
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,179
me at nine years old although not much

291
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,699
has changed in the field assistant is my

292
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:52,929
younger sister the mission to catch the

293
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:54,759
Frog for Show and Tell and so so this is

294
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:56,458
one example it's obviously an example

295
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,778
from my childhood but I've also seen

296
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,159
this done successfully with other types

297
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:02,889
of stories it could be a classic you

298
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,139
tick it could be a question that you

299
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,120
think about a lot and I saw one really

300
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,709
good example of I was going through and

301
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,179
some of your statements somebody is

302
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,789
really interested in like invasive

303
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,349
species and so the process of like

304
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:16,059
realizing that organisms that they

305
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,399
really loved as a kid are actually like

306
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:22,599
invasive organisms and so it doesn't

307
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,039
have to be exact and and then another

308
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,899
nice thing to do is if you start with

309
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,079
some sort of example to kind of weave it

310
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:31,179
through as you go on and so I showed you

311
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,259
earlier this sort of big like Oh early

312
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:36,969
exposure like fascination whatever but

313
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,860
then I linked it back to these actual

314
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,600
concrete things that I would then go on

315
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,950
to talk about in my research statement

316
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,320
and so mutability watching the drain

317
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,920
pipe fill with water and then drain

318
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,840
which is when you can see the frogs

319
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,659
interconnectedness and diversity with

320
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,129
all the animals of the pond and so if

321
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,719
you're gonna go this route it's really

322
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,580
nice to tie it into actual concrete

323
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,879
ideas and things that you want to study

324
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,449
in grad school

325
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,828
okay and then the last thing which we

326
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:09,568
are like really hammering home today is

327
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:12,000
it is so important to have somebody else

328
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:13,919
read your statement and so you can see

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,049
these are three different people that I

330
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,000
had read my statement between the first

331
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:20,399
and second time and there's a lot of

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,559
read a lot of deleted things and added

333
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,899
things and that this is super important

334
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,638
and like don't be afraid of it it is a

335
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,409
personal statement so it can feel kind

336
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,659
of uncomfortable but it's so important

337
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,219
and something else

338
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:35,309
oh yeah it's also different from a

339
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,220
college statement and which I was

340
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:40,379
talking about the beginning and it's you

341
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,759
really have to make sure it goes back to

342
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,889
ultimately what you're interested in

343
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,019
pursuing in graduate school and which

344
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:49,948
was that Aaron was saying and then a

345
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:52,740
last point and that I think has come up

346
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:54,719
a lot um is how to talk about difficult

347
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,789
situations and so a lot of people will

348
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,129
have something that came up for them

349
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:01,139
personally or academically that affected

350
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,730
grades and so it's okay to talk about

351
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,299
those things in your personal statement

352
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,310
it's a good opportunity to explain any

353
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,948
sort of like adversity that you faced

354
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:13,379
and a couple of pointers on that and

355
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:15,028
it's good to be brief if you can you

356
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,610
don't want to go into the situation so

357
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,870
much that you're cutting out a

358
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,990
discussion of your research interests

359
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,669
for example and it's also good for the

360
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,318
purpose of a personal statement to be

361
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:31,110
generally positive and forward-looking

362
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:33,059
and so okay that's it then I think we're

363
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,129
gonna take we'll take questions too so

364
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:41,609
you guys are gonna have I'm sorry you

365
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:43,769
can cut press we're gonna and have a

366
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,329
little bit of a brief Q&amp;A for you guys

367
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,549
but also keep in mind that you're gonna

368
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:49,620
be meeting one-on-one with two grad

369
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,729
students who also read your personal

370
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,188
statement so if you have a question that

371
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,170
you feel like is like a general one from

372
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:57,809
this that might be helpful for a lot of

373
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:59,429
you guys to hear about um that was a

374
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,539
time to do that and then we'll break out

375
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,539
into those smaller groups

376
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:27,589
right so the question was this idea of

377
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,269
like if you get conflicting information

378
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:31,160
about like oh this anecdote it's great

379
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,409
versus like oh this anecdote sucks and

380
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,328
the idea too that like the people that

381
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:39,889
you're applying to might have differing

382
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:41,208
opinions um so one way that I would

383
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,980
think about getting around that is

384
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,679
really do your research on the school

385
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,300
and the resources I think um cinnamons

386
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,638
example is awesome of her narrative hook

387
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:51,559
but that's not like the only way to do a

388
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,180
narrative hook either there's a lot of

389
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,039
different ways to open up in a way that

390
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,179
kind of draws the reader and it has your

391
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,299
voice and it should be something that

392
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:01,758
feels natural to you and your story so

393
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,198
if writing about catching frogs with

394
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,579
your sister and that way it doesn't feel

395
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,769
like something that would be very

396
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:08,659
genuine to you then you know it's not

397
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,310
like a prescriptive you have to start

398
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:41,809
your statement this way does that make

399
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:44,229
sense yeah well I think that gets to the

400
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:46,429
idea too of like the explaining

401
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,259
difficult situations but making sure

402
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,818
that you keep it brief and that you keep

403
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,350
it towards the future the idea of the

404
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,639
personal statement is that you're

405
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,079
spending a little bit of time looking

406
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,970
backwards and reflecting but you're

407
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,198
using that to drive here's what I'm

408
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,329
doing next like this is what's

409
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,740
motivating me to move forward and to go

410
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,509
to grad school in to succeed in grad

411
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,519
school not so much just like I'm looking

412
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:05,838
back like it's not a therapy session you

413
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,429
know I'd be like like you're kind of

414
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,050
trying to take away the main lessons

415
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:10,549
that you learned from each thing in a

416
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,588
way that's looking forward which can be

417
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:14,870
a really tough balance to strike yeah

418
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,220
and this yeah like this explaining

419
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,019
situations like I had something that

420
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,459
like affected my grades and my first

421
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,810
draft actually like there's a paragraph

422
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:25,129
on it and then I had someone that was

423
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:26,778
like yeah yeah like what Aaron's saying

424
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,669
like being positive and forward-looking

425
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,019
and then also getting other people to

426
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:32,688
look at it to see you like Oh

427
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,639
this like strike you and I okay way am I

428
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:35,988
like presenting it is like oh this is

429
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,110
something that shows that I am like

430
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:40,790
really resilient and like really like

431
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,379
dedicated to this path there is this

432
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:44,868
something that is like taking away from

433
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:47,089
the rest of my or like drawing attention

434
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:53,959
away from the rest of my application so

435
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:59,319
getting feedback on that is also yeah

436
00:16:53,958 --> 00:17:03,738
Oh something let's repeat the question

437
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:06,709
yeah so the question was this was for my

438
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:08,240
GFP and then asking if he had included

439
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:16,939
grades for this I think they did

440
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:18,740
included there's a transcript yeah yeah

441
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,449
so this gets back to it Aaron was saying

442
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,769
about reading the instructions so

443
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,899
there's actually it went back and looked

444
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:25,778
at my actual grad school apps in there

445
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:27,918
and there's a lot of variation and what

446
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,230
different universities will ask for some

447
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,820
of them do like a combined personal so

448
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,470
the GRP does a combined personal

449
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:35,569
statement with research experience so

450
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,429
those are both together other

451
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:39,048
universities will have like a statement

452
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:41,750
of purpose separate from a research

453
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:43,940
statement and then some just have one

454
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:47,829
statement so you really have to read the

455
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,830
directions for the specific University

456
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,319
yeah I so I'm teaching freshman writing

457
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,589
right now and I cannot express enough is

458
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:03,619
like if I swear for the maybe not the

459
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:04,939
crappy first draft is very important so

460
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,888
it's so much easier to start with a

461
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,149
crappy or maybe not so crappy but maybe

462
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:11,240
not quite right for this particular

463
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:13,939
thing um piece of writing and then edit

464
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,730
it to fit the next thing than it is to

465
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,250
be like blink page ah to write like five

466
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,380
pages about this thing so yeah what you

467
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,788
guys and what we've seen and editing and

468
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,649
what you guys applied with for your

469
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:26,538
personal statement is like a place to

470
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:28,129
start or grad school applications in

471
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,349
some cases I know some of you folks have

472
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,520
already applied with the personal

473
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:34,278
statement that you said those two so

474
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,740
like it's better to start with something

475
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:39,500
and then you can kind of move paragraphs

476
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,509
around and expand more on one point if

477
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,460
you need to lengthen add in a new idea

478
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:45,559
like but it's better to start

479
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,350
with something to edit that should start

480
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:55,190
with a blank page in a lot of pieces

481
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:56,449
yeah yeah that's a great point and so

482
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,460
the idea of having your letter writers

483
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,410
go into some of the more detail about an

484
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,740
adverse experience you had or a couple

485
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,759
of semesters or however whatever came up

486
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,620
is to keep in mind too that you have

487
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,970
this whole thing as a whole package and

488
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:10,429
the personal statement is one point of

489
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,930
that package so it's okay for some

490
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,549
things to be brief in some places and to

491
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,870
be expanded on in other places as well

492
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:21,190
yeah it's also good practice to send

493
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:24,469
these statements to your letter writers

494

00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:35,960
peer advisors if there's our editors I

499
