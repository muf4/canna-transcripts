1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,289
so we talked about soil earlier and we

2
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,899
talked about the community community

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,119
sore community being a type of soil so

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
when you begin to plant the garden it

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,230
Ellis traits the importance of helping

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,910
others so you're working alongside a

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,410
community you're not going in to teach

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,268
me behind the garden again you're

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,250
facilitating so you're creating a space

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,070
you're being a resource because your

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,839
gardening yes but you're also

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,570
cultivating a space for a community to

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:37,769
learn from each other any excuse to get

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,270
people just interacting with a common

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,800
context I mean that's a great thing

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,840
about gardening right yeah I mean

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,359
there's just so much to talk about you

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,760
know and there's also a commitment to

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,009
providing a portion of the food to the

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,439
community so when you're planting you're

21
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,750
thinking about the types of foods and

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,549
how the food is going to be used in the

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,488
community and that's how you seen your

24
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,849
approach so we're using gardening to

25
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,920
help communities organized and develop

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,920
education efforts and because I'm an

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,990
intense gardener myself my grandmother

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,269
was a farmer and from Haiti and I i

29
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,310
remember my connection to the earth and

30
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,009
it was always a healing place for me and

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,719
I felt that the children needed a

32
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,819
healing place because of all the trauma

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,859
that they're suffering in the city that

34
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,069
are not accounted for that impact will

35
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,180
behavior and also that also impact the

36
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,908
learning ability the attention span and

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:37,350
I decided a little pilot project on my

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:40,710
own where I use my own money to I but

39
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:43,438
Cesar night and I but cups and a little

40
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,419
sticks for them to to label the seeds

41
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,868
and I created lessons around that for

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,240
them and how they can be inspired by the

43
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,700
ability of a seat to survive no matter

44
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,259
what if they have to go crew here to get

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,060
those funny they have to go under and we

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,700
appear to get the water the death

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,350
stepped on their growth flat it's just

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,899
it's too inspiring there's so much

49
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,239
learning that can really empower this

50
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,368
children if they can see the tenacity of

51
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,639
the dandelion that was my lesson

52
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,408
Gardens can be used as metaphors to

53
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,408
build partnerships between youth and

54
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:19,139
adults and so a garden is a great place

55
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:22,310
to bring in two generations of people to

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,309
talk about building community

57
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,199
you
