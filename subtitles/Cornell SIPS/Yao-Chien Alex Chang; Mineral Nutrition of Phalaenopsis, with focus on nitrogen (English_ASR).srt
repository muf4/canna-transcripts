00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,878
University

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:13,830
hi good afternoon everybody kind of I'm

4
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:17,160
very happy under very excited to be here

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,160
back in Ithaca so because I did my PhD

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,960
here and I will show you my favorite

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:30,778
photo in Ithaca so I work with this

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:35,070
young guy okay so and after I returned

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:38,399
to Taiwan in the past 14 years I have

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,878
been doing research on Oh kids so title

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,920
I work on the physiology study of okay

12
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:48,478
so for example a floral floral

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,739
immigration or post-harvest tissue

14
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:55,500
culture and a lot in mera nutrition so

15
00:00:52,738 --> 00:01:00,899
today I want to share with you kind of

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:04,618
the some interesting result I think with

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,819
you regarding that infant in offices and

18
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:11,790
the with focus on nitrogen so I think

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,669
many of the many of you here should have

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,050
known that right now

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,960
Phalaenopsis is the number one photo

22
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,629
crop worldwide so it's the number one in

23
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,869
the United States and is the number one

24
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:29,399
kind of being kind of most of the other

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,920
country so here I'm offering you some of

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,550
the background information why I

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,370
conducted those study so if you check

28
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,799
the literature you will found a lot of

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,189
in concern result we got in the

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,829
Phalaenopsis on nutrition so sometimes

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,109
they are even control over see to each

32
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,030
other even they are using the same code

33
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,670
for some time they are using the same

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,790
measure they may feel very very

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,450
differently so why and the many of the

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,270
core they try to reduce or terminate the

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,510
nitrogen fertilization given the forcing

38
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:10,500
period of phalaenopsis so is this a good

39
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:14,159
practice I don't think so so I have some

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,930
research on that so under then kind of

41
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,628
course as a researcher we have to

42
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,360
provide some recommendation to the core

43
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:25,840
because right now the Fed analysis is a

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,620
very very important crop a worldwide so

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,009
the story started about 13 years ago we

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,519
conducted an experiment at least we had

47
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:38,348
kind of different rate of nitrogen

48
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,280
infrared of phosphorus and a different

49
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:45,128
way of potassium and we kind of do the

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,879
treatment or to the fair analysis but

51
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:53,379
even with kind of nitrogen deficiency

52
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,019
for more than 18 years so it was one

53
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:59,169
year and a half the fattiness novices

54
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,310
can still flower was to spike and the

55
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:06,098
signal for the phosphorus deficiency

56
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:10,719
under the potassium deficiency so they

57
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:14,589
are very very strong so kind of here I

58
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,590
want to know why they are so good tied

59
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:22,450
up to deal with the kind of the nutrient

60
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:26,079
stress stress even with such a long time

61
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:29,318
so we thought there is a kind of very

62
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:32,739
very strong kind of nutrient storage

63
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:35,768
pool in fear analysis so they are very

64
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:39,280
very tolerant to the nutrient or stress

65
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:43,000
so then we try to induce the

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,370
deficiencies Sifton unfair analysis but

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,370
we have to use a small depression

68
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,310
because we thought with a smaller plan

69
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,310
they have a smaller size of the nutrient

70
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,439
storage pool under then we have to wait

71
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,739
for about eight months even with a

72
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:04,269
smaller plan to get a differentiation of

73
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:08,200
the nitrogen deficiency so this is some

74
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:12,730
chlorosis and the phosphorus deficiency

75
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:16,598
so us it'll reduce our growth under some

76
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:19,930
proposed pigmentation underneath under

77
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:23,680
the phosphorus deficiency under you will

78
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:27,098
find some or necrosis symptom under the

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,139
potassium deficiency so those kind of

80
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:33,348
six simple turn of the deficiency

81
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,449
is very similar to that in other crop

82
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:38,329
but they are also something different

83
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,610
with fair analysis for example a took a

84
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:43,248
long time to have the deficiency

85
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,278
symptoms and it is very difficult or to

86
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:48,770
induce under then are something

87
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:51,379
different for example for the deficiency

88
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:54,168
of potassium we can observe that on the

89
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,658
upper lip in the literature most of the

90
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:59,870
deficits of channel potassium will

91
00:04:56,658 --> 00:05:03,259
appear in the lower lip so also some

92
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:06,740
similarity also some are differences so

93
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,319
the part one of my talk I want to show

94
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,259
you how good they are still in and they

95
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:16,550
utilize the nutrient are with

96
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:19,460
Phalaenopsis and this is another my

97
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,028
favorite photo so i want to show you

98
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:26,120
they are very very tolerant to many kind

99
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:31,848
of environmental stress so they can dip

100
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:34,939
in at age that the bird do not like okay

101
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:38,598
so from the trait of the some of the

102
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:41,569
data I just show you we think kind of

103
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:45,649
there should be a very very large pore

104
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:48,050
of the stone nitrogen in fed analysis we

105
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:51,139
think this is a reason that different

106
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,889
researcher got different experimental

107
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:57,408
result so another thing is that the

108
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:01,250
friend abscess they respond very very

109
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:04,250
slowly to the application of fertilizer

110
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:08,588
so this is also make it very difficult

111
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:12,620
to understand its nutrient requirement

112
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:15,439
so for my study I want to distinguish

113
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,778
the stone nitrogen and the fertilizer

114
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,689
nitrogen because in apprenticea

115
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:23,810
Phalaenopsis this already so many

116
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:26,689
nitrogen has been stolen at issue for

117
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,300
example in in amino acid in protein in

118
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:32,149
nucleic acid they are not of natural

119
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,800
trait so if we just put on fertilizer to

120
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:36,588
different treatment and we do the

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,430
analysis maybe we were just kind of a

122
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:43,519
debtor nitrogen table is already in the

123
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,150
print issue so here I use the stable

124
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,560
isotope

125
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:52,399
nitrogen 15 to distinguish the nitrogen

126
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,220
has been stored in the print issue so

127
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,989
this is the stone nitrogen you can just

128
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,330
think that way this is the stone

129
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,030
nitrogen before we started the

130
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:04,490
experiment and also the effect of

131
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,719
fertilizer nitrogen so I miss the

132
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,180
fertilizer effect

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:14,419
I avoid apply after the treatment so

134
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,300
nitrogen 15 is a stable isotope and it

135
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:18,500
has a one more Neutron than that of a

136
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,560
natural June 14

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,319
so just use the mass we will be able to

138
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,430
distinguish nitrogen 15 and the nitrogen

139
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,159
14 so by this way I will be able to kind

140
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,519
of compare the stone nitrogen under the

141
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,189
fertilizer on nitrogen so I use the

142
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:40,459
enrichment method of the nitrogen 15

143
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:44,240
labeling so I just applied a label

144
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:46,549
fertilizer into the substrate and after

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,098
a certain period of time I will check

146
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,728
the concentration in different organ of

147
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:57,038
the fair announcers so for each harvest

148
00:07:52,728 --> 00:08:00,560
I would had dry way and I will get a

149
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:04,399
nitrogen concentration after analysis so

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,550
by multiple them I will get I will have

151
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,739
a nitrogen content under by multiple a

152
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,500
driving driveway under nitrogen 15

153
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,870
concentration I will get a nitrogen 15

154
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,839
contact but there are some natural

155
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:22,098
abundance of nitrogen 15 are in the

156
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:26,109
nature so we have to subtract them so

157
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:29,180
and after we do that then we will get

158
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,450
nitrogen 15 concentration at present

159
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,778
access and also the nitrogen content

160
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,959
access so when you say the earth access

161
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:40,939
in the kind of following or data you

162
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:45,109
will know last result from the

163
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:48,370
fertilizer treatment so kind of we had

164
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:53,360
deducted the natural abandon or nitrogen

165
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:56,690
15 so this is the first our isotope our

166
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
study we will apply the label fertilizer

167
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,399
and

168
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:04,549
in the 8 day period we analyzed the

169
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:08,958
nitrogen 15 concentration in the first

170
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:12,169
leaf and in the fourth deal so here are

171
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,928
kind of because the first leaf were

172
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:18,349
still growing so you will see the dry

173
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:22,850
weight our was increasing during the at

174
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:26,058
P at a period but now you can see that

175
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:30,139
the nitrogen content was also increased

176
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:33,110
because look biomass is increasing so

177
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:35,688
are you substrate or this one by this

178
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,629
one then you all know that the first

179
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:43,009
leap acquire four point three mini gram

180
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:45,819
of nitrogen so remember this 4 points

181
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:49,699
free mini crammed under kind of by the

182
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:53,208
analysis of nitrogen 15 are you a see

183
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:56,389
here first the first leaf is a stronger

184
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:58,599
thing or sink or than that of the

185
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:02,360
firstly yeah because they are growing

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:08,209
under during these eight days kind of

187
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,620
the first leap got 170 microplane of

188
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:15,229
nitrogen 15

189
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:17,990
nitrogen 15 Kaido we just have 24 2

190
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:21,620
percent of the nitrogen 15 in the

191
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:26,209
fertilizer so pilot calculation we know

192
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:29,360
are during this day period the first

193
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:32,299
leap got only point 5 mini gram of

194
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,230
nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen from the

195
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:39,198
fertilizer in previous slide I say four

196
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:43,519
point three so it means that the first

197
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:47,048
third leaf only got a percent of the

198
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:51,169
nitrogen Baker from the fertilizer so

199
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:54,198
how about other eighty-eight percent of

200
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:56,149
the nitrogen yeah because they are from

201
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:58,969
our somewhere else

202
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,749
I mean last from the stove on nitrogen

203
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:07,610
so then I did another kind of Kenko

204
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:10,069
study so we are check the nitrogen 15 at

205
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,300
a different time from the vegetative

206
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:14,778
growth or

207
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:18,729
to the or reproductives gross and here

208
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:21,799
you can see it again this is the our

209
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,230
Unicron live and the digital good so

210
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,469
during a vegetative or gross at least

211
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,539
two organ were strong sync for nitrogen

212
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:35,149
but after the Fed analysis has the spike

213
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:37,639
the nitrogen 15 concentration are in a

214
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:41,350
good decrease under that further

215
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:45,230
decrease when the inflorescence was

216
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:49,310
developing so it means that dude came at

217
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,039
as a storage organ for the nitrogen and

218
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:55,250
the provided nitrogen for the further

219
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,439
development of the info racers and we

220
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,339
got similar result by checking the

221
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,779
nitrogen 15 content the nitrogen 50

222
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:09,649
content in a maturity decrease are when

223
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:14,240
the essence was developing so then we

224
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:16,730
further our conduct another research to

225
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,028
check kind of the storage function of

226
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,639
the mature live so because this is

227
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:25,338
different from what we saw in the

228
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,389
literature so we have to prove that so

229
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:33,709
we put a label fertilizer arm under then

230
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:37,458
we that we did it kind of last for at

231
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:41,599
week so during this at week the nitrogen

232
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:44,750
15 will just be partitioned to many of

233
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:50,690
the kind of old organ so then we do the

234
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:54,708
root excision so this is no this has

235
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:57,079
been doing both or 25 percent or 75 50

236
00:12:54,708 --> 00:13:00,979
percent and 75 percent of a tooth has

237
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:03,439
been excised so we want to know so what

238
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:09,560
would happen if we move they move or

239
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:12,649
some of the dirt so here are for the

240
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:16,789
nitrogen 15 content or you will see that

241
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:19,490
with the mode dude has been removed the

242
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:22,909
nitrogen 15 content in the dirt decrease

243
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,360
so it's obvious because we remove the

244
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,009
dirt

245
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,490
then we remove

246
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:31,399
nitrogen ar-15 from the dirt and the

247
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,589
frontier the nunik relief the treatment

248
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,610
you will see that kind of the nitrogen

249
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:39,680
content is quite stable so no difference

250
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,589
between the treatment and the is the

251
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,049
same for the info racers because they

252
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:48,980
are strong sync so the friend apps just

253
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:52,849
do their best to provide the nitrogen or

254
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:56,870
to the new Negro on unique are going

255
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:59,449
organ so what is very very interesting

256
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,240
that surprised is that the decrease of

257
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:05,419
the nitrogen 15 content in the maturity

258
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,669
so you kind of prune the root and the

259
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:09,500
you got a result of the reduce natural

260
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:12,229
u15 content in the mature leaf

261
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,198
it means that the mature lip also has a

262
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,110
function of natural tree storage and the

263
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,958
lay can provide nitrogen to the newly

264
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,169
grown leaf or to the inflorescence

265
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:27,169
during the reproductive stage so this is

266
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:31,639
very interesting that maturely if in

267
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:34,578
fear analysis also act as nitrogen

268
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,970
storage oden not can provide nitrogen

269
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:44,929
are kind of to the infrared sense or

270
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:47,690
Department okay and the kind of we know

271
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:50,509
that a for the infrareds development

272
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,500
some of nitrogen came from the stone

273
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:58,789
nitrogen and here I want to know so for

274
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,278
a nitrogen here are well that just come

275
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:05,179
to come from this stage or this stage of

276
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,578
every stage so this is a very very small

277
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:10,719
size prime this is the medium size this

278
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:15,739
is large size so each stage took about

279
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,930
four to five months so each stage so for

280
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,620
the first experiment is under imperfect

281
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:23,189
relation kind of I compare these three

282
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,649
stage

283
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,930
and then for the second experiment I can

284
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:32,009
I compare just a large size print stage

285
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:34,859
and the force in our period because the

286
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:37,259
fair enough see the growth so slow just

287
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,240
for this one single experiment it took

288
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,938
me two years to complete

289
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,639
yeah so I have to separate these two

290
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:47,759
experiment under then I also have

291
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,079
another experiment that I did that under

292
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,649
import validation and under reduce our

293
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:58,318
fertilization so kind of three our

294
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:00,990
experiment so here are we keep our

295
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:05,698
nitrogen 15 level fertilizer two

296
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,659
different stage under then after a six

297
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:10,889
week of treatment

298
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:13,500
we're apart it to remove the nitrogen 15

299
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:16,139
that we kept our to the fan analysis and

300
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,899
here we have the negative control no

301
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,750
nitrogen 15 and here is the positive

302
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:24,179
control we apply not what you think in

303
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,929
two older three stages of the growth

304
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:31,679
just just as a positive control and I

305
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:35,399
have to emphasize that all the nitrogen

306
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:38,278
label applied to all the treatment they

307
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,708
were all the same kind of different

308
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:45,360
between the treatment is just the timing

309
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:49,979
of the nitrogen 15 laboring so and here

310
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,860
are when the crane was flowering so it

311
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,409
took a long time so from the the young

312
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,810
priests age are truly spot visible stage

313
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:01,198
is more than one years so it's about

314
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:04,798
kind of 16 months or or fourteen months

315
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:08,639
then in the info racers we found the

316
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:11,459
nitrogen v came from the small size

317
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,009
print the medium size print and the

318
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,980
large size print so it means that

319
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:21,088
because of the small size is just listed

320
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:24,449
and the father a kind of the large size

321
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:27,119
is like this big so it's a huge

322
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:30,240
difference but even are a very very

323
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,839
young or very nasty sprain make a stone

324
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,819
nitrogen and provided nitrogen for

325
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,649
infrared system even one year

326
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:42,579
so they have a strong very strong

327
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:45,940
capacity are to stoke the nutrient even

328
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:49,089
a very very young so this is kind of a

329
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,400
total nitrogen are contained in a small

330
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,619
sized friend a medium-sized friend and a

331
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,350
large sized friend and because in a

332
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:59,169
large size printer Hobart more biomass

333
00:17:56,349 --> 00:18:02,769
of course the total nitrogen our

334
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:06,570
companies hire but they was once a very

335
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:09,400
very interested no matter how much

336
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:13,119
nitrogen they have accumulated during

337
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,250
that single stage there was about a

338
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,209
certain percent of nitrogen has been

339
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:21,970
stored and the youth are to provide the

340
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:26,500
informations so it's kind of a

341
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:30,730
percentage of 6% to 8% so it's a very

342
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,390
very special kind of terroristic for our

343
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:37,690
fair analysis so kind of the finding for

344
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,420
this experiment is that they can store

345
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,940
the nitrogen very well and provide on

346
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,700
the nitrogen later for the infra

347
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,509
resonsible development even or one year

348
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:52,230
later and if we kind of calculate the

349
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:55,059
relative concentrate our concern

350
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,460
contribution are to the inferences on

351
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,129
nitrogen is kind of you'll get this

352
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,829
number

353
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:06,730
16:25 under ninety five or fifteen nine

354
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:10,599
percent for our different or stage under

355
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:14,289
then I had a kind of experiment B so I

356
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:16,509
just compare kind of the large size or

357
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,240
price stage are during a vegetative

358
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:22,240
stage under then I apply that during the

359
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,940
reproductive stage again I want to say

360
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,019
the game that all the treatment received

361
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:32,470
the same among of total nitrogen so here

362
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:36,460
you will see if we apply the nitrogen 15

363
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:40,839
during the vegetative stage the newly

364
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:44,559
grown deep will have the most are kind

365
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:47,259
of higher nitrogen 15 concentration

366
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,539
because they are strong sync during this

367
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:52,289
stage but if we repair

368
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:58,059
naturally 15 during a repetitive stage

369
00:19:52,289 --> 00:20:02,019
the the info races will have a kind of

370
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:04,569
high amount of nitrogen 15 content among

371
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:08,920
the open so this is kind of a strong

372
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:10,809
sync during the reproductive stage so if

373
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,590
we were partner this is nitrogen 15

374
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:17,349
content it will apply the nitrogen 15 15

375
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:22,089
during the vegetative stage or they will

376
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:25,599
stow it and the later on uo5 17 9 micro

377
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:29,379
gram of nitrogen 15 in the info racers

378
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:32,199
and if you are applied on nitrogen 15

379
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:36,730
during the reproductive stage it will

380
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:40,120
end up in the inference 174 microgram

381
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:44,019
then we can do kind of the relative

382
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:46,659
contribution for this to stage so follow

383
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:50,710
in for kind of the relative contribution

384
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:54,100
is 31 percent from the last precise

385
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,019
stage and the 69 percent are from the

386
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,959
fertilizer we just applied to

387
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:05,680
Phalaenopsis during the office in our

388
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:08,529
period so yeah so ah because um for the

389
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,529
nitrogen fertilizer we applied during

390
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:14,379
the forcing period is accounted for 69

391
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:16,960
percent of the nitrogen or in the info

392
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:20,350
racers so it's very important to

393
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,579
continue supreme nitrogen even during

394
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:26,949
the forcing or period so we had the

395
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:30,159
experiment a or we got a ratio of

396
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,500
contribution we have aspera B so then we

397
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,540
can calculate kind of the relative

398
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,650
contribution because laid both

399
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:41,740
experiment has the same stage of the

400
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,670
large size pram so for the nitrogen are

401
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,059
in the inflorescence 7 7% from the small

402
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,310
size stage 11 from the medium-sized are

403
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:55,720
25% from the large size or price stage

404
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:58,059
under 57 percent of the nitrogen in

405
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,329
brief in fluorescence came from the

406
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,349
fertilizer we just apply or during the

407
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:03,339
foursome period

408
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:06,730
so it's bare

409
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:08,109
very important to give them sufficient

410
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,089
on nitrogen

411
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:15,429
even during the forcing or period then

412
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:18,699
for the next experiment is kind of

413
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,670
everybody are complicated so we have

414
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:25,870
kinda we try to reduce the fertilizer

415
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:28,630
level during the forcing period and to

416
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:31,659
see how they utilize the stove a

417
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:35,730
nutrient are if they in conquer the

418
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,350
nutrient are stress so this is the floor

419
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,069
fertilization we label is at different

420
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:44,619
time vegetative stage reproductive stage

421
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:46,929
and the further reduce our strengths of

422
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:50,769
the fertilizer in the same hour to labor

423
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:54,220
to kind of to time kind of twist age of

424
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:58,299
the nitrogen laboring under for this one

425
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:02,289
we didn't give any or nitrogen on - fair

426
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:05,490
enough stood in the faucet or period so

427
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:08,829
then we cut with cheddar or nitrogen 15

428
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:11,109
concentration in the info racers so I

429
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:14,829
will read this off graph like this way

430
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:18,459
so this is a important relation this is

431
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:21,250
reduce fertilization and when we reduce

432
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:25,480
the fertilization during the forcing

433
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:28,630
period you will get more nitrogen 15 in

434
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,019
the info racers so it means if when they

435
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:35,620
encounter a nutrient stress they were

436
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:39,940
used more the nitrogen has been stalled

437
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:42,000
or in the open tissue so I would do a

438
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,640
kind of I will show you kind of the

439
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,200
credible data for comparing the two

440
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:53,710
stage so the same calculation so under

441
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,680
imperfect relation kind of the large

442
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,670
size print stage or the nitrogen achieve

443
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:06,070
accounted for 43% under the nitrogen

444
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:09,039
fertilizer are 57% and the name when we

445
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:11,559
are reduce the fertilization

446
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,048
during the foursome period the ratio

447
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,128
change yeah

448
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:19,408
so the stone nitrogen accounted for 89%

449
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,230
under the fertilizer nitrogen just

450
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:25,590
accounted for 11 percent because we

451
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,919
reduce the supply of fertilizer during

452
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:31,738
the foursome period and of course if we

453
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,909
didn't give the Phalaenopsis any

454
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:39,298
fertilizer of course 100 percent of the

455
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:42,119
nitrogen are in the info racers came

456
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:44,548
from the stove nitrogen so they will be

457
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:46,970
able to store the nitrogen and they use

458
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:50,249
it for info residence development later

459
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,868
so here I'm showing you the kind of

460
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:57,509
effect of the reduce of fertilization or

461
00:24:53,868 --> 00:25:00,839
during the forcing period so if you got

462
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:04,710
a very very healthy fair enough to start

463
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,988
with then the effect of the fertilizer

464
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,350
nitrogen during the forcing period was

465
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:13,379
minor because it's just a difference of

466
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:18,469
two flower they can still perform well

467
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:22,648
on flowering of the kind of on Friday

468
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:26,308
so the finding here is that stone

469
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:29,668
nitrogen becomes a very very important

470
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:33,048
natural resource for the info residents

471
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:38,879
development when the fertility label is

472
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:41,118
limited so for the second part I would

473
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:45,959
like to kind of show you some

474
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:48,720
information very very brute briefly for

475
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,528
the progressive change of the nitrogen

476
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,710
of the carbon our queen the Phalaenopsis

477
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:58,980
are developing I mean for oldest kind of

478
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:02,669
organ order stage and I want to note the

479
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,308
effect of nitrogen fertilizer on the

480
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:07,859
flowering of freedom novices because

481
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:09,628
many of the grow they think they can

482
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:13,368
kind of change the flooring of

483
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:17,128
Phalaenopsis by man meaning pet the or

484
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:21,868
fertilization or during the forcing or

485
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:25,138
period so then we check kind of the

486
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:26,918
carbon and the nitrogen label at a

487
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:30,069
different stage

488
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:33,009
then we will get the ricean ratio and I

489
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:36,038
have to research on this kind of

490
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:39,849
strength - analysis for such a long time

491
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:43,058
I have none the result but here at one

492
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:45,069
more coffee bar is a miniature time so

493
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:47,558
for a miniature is something that just

494
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:51,249
very very compact and the for the same

495
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:55,569
time type is kind of huge is huge so I

496
00:26:51,249 --> 00:27:00,460
want to know kind of the trend of the CN

497
00:26:55,569 --> 00:27:02,739
ratio changes so here's three so uh you

498
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,100
will see some newer system data here but

499
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:08,619
for me it's Blair kind of for a carbon

500
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:11,678
concentration they are relative stable

501
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:13,959
so they just kind of a range from our

502
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,899
forty one percent two forty three

503
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,470
percent for me is quite a stable but you

504
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:22,058
are fired

505
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:24,069
decreasing trend on nitrogen on nitrogen

506
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:26,829
so when they was young when they were

507
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:29,528
just differ asked high nitrogen about

508
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:33,038
four four percent but when they get

509
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:35,739
mature and they were able to flower you

510
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,679
just drop to about two percent so you

511
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:41,679
will find a kind of discrete at the

512
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,830
decreasing trend when they get mature

513
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,559
become more mature and because this is

514
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:51,158
stable this is decreasing so for the CN

515
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:55,019
ratio you'll find an increase a strand a

516
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:59,249
trend esta prang are getting more mature

517
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:02,288
so then we want to know if we change the

518
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:05,460
nitrogen label or during the forcing

519
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:08,739
period will not affect the performance

520
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:12,369
the floating performance of do these two

521
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:16,720
cultivar so ah this is the standard type

522
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:19,118
this is the miniature so of course here

523
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,509
for the nitrogen concentration when we

524
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:25,988
reduce the fertilizer nitrogen that will

525
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:28,599
reduce the our nitrogen concentration in

526
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:31,869
the tissue so it is quite significant

527
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:35,788
and the list means that the Sein ratio

528
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:40,949
will increase as the fertilizer nitrogen

529
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:44,190
decrease because the carbon our label is

530
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:48,298
quite our stable then how about a

531
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:51,179
flowering so here for the center type

532
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:54,509
Phalaenopsis the trench are in the

533
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:58,130
fertilizer nitrogen did affect taste to

534
00:28:54,509 --> 00:29:00,960
spiking but if you look at the number

535
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:04,679
whistler control it's just about two day

536
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,329
difference so practically i would

537
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:11,778
consider kind of no inference about for

538
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:15,178
the miniature type you will see some

539
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:17,250
impact so if you increase the or

540
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:21,360
nitrogen neighbor during the forcing

541
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,028
period that would delay the spiking for

542
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,209
about nine days so kind of the

543
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:30,740
fertilizer nitrogen manipulation has

544
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,840
more impact under miniature type

545
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,109
Phalaenopsis and for me is kind of is

546
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:41,339
quite simple because our pages has a

547
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:44,189
kind of smaller on nitrogen or poor so

548
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,740
yeah this is just to show you kind of

549
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,500
the deficiency of nitrogen were at the

550
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,808
basic fraud flooring for about or two

551
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,888
days so it's not a big deal and the

552
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:57,898
photometer type with high rate of

553
00:29:54,888 --> 00:30:01,619
nitrogen that made in later flowering

554
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:05,099
for about nine day ten days so kind of

555
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:08,668
kind of fertilizer nitrogen has more

556
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:12,689
impact on miniatures - analysis than the

557
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:15,059
standard type or fair analysis so here I

558
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,028
think I'd of the prony number is very

559
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:20,369
very important so even we change it a

560
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:24,119
fertilizer rate or during the forcing

561
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:27,418
period for the standard - analysis the

562
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:30,739
Froude number was not affected but

563
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:33,240
changing the fertilizer nitrogen will

564
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,829
affect the froning number in the

565
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,778
miniature Phalaenopsis

566
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:41,939
again just because they have less kind

567
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:46,528
of a smaller pool of nitrogen stone

568
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:48,990
nitrogen so but kind of they were some

569
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,409
effect but with the lower rate of

570
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,650
nitrogen will decrease the number of the

571
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:58,400
flower so I don't reckon

572
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:05,480
the clora to reduce the nitrogen during

573
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:07,700
the kind of the 14-hour period so I will

574
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,599
just show you the photo the nitrogen

575
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:14,480
rate you're enforcing did not affect the

576
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:18,469
standard type of Phalaenopsis much but

577
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,009
the world rate of the nitrogen order

578
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:24,920
enforcing will reduce the are throw

579
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:27,500
number of Fred in offices

580
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,690
so this is the kind of the our

581
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,809
conclusion for the previous two

582
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,330
experiment so not too much effect under

583
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:39,319
standard type Phalaenopsis some effect

584
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:41,779
on the miniature type so the rate of the

585
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:44,210
unnatural unity reinforcing work at the

586
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:47,180
basic of roaring and the high rate would

587
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,210
delay the frauding of the minions would

588
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,549
have Phalaenopsis but kind of the

589
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,670
falling quality the best foreign quality

590
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:58,309
still come from the regular our nitrogen

591
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:01,660
fertilization so we don't need to reduce

592
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:05,389
all terminate the nitrogen application

593
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,550
ordering or forcing and this is just

594
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:10,850
because they have different size of

595
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:14,029
stone nitrogen and this also is brand

596
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:19,730
kind of the inconsistent result has been

597
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:23,089
existed exist in the literature so under

598
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:28,970
then kind of further less part i want to

599
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:32,689
kind of demonstrate the optima medium ec

600
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:36,950
are for the Phalaenopsis or cultivation

601
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:40,220
so because from my previous experiment

602
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,880
we knew that we have to keep fed an

603
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,940
abscess continuous fertilization even

604
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:51,620
from a very very young trend throughout

605
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:54,370
our tutor are forcing or period so here

606
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:57,529
we did we kept different grade of

607
00:32:54,369 --> 00:33:01,459
fertilizer to Phalaenopsis and the with

608
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:05,450
higher rate of fertilization you will

609
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:08,329
have kind of higher or shoot or try way

610
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:13,819
but that would decrease

611
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:16,519
the truth booth biomass so we think it's

612
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:19,970
very important to keep the good bearers

613
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:23,450
of the chute to rule ratio and we have

614
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,700
that are for the treatment at 100

615
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,980
pathway medium nitrogen of the

616
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,649
fertilizer so they have a good growth

617
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,220
here annaleigh also have a good

618
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:37,009
flowering quality and for this the

619
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:40,038
medium you see was ranged from point six

620
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:43,970
to one point zero this is semen per

621
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:46,548
meter under then we want to know the

622
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,399
route quality the relationship between

623
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:51,819
the good quality under the medium you

624
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:56,709
see by this way we can also determine

625
00:33:51,819 --> 00:34:01,519
the optimum or medium EC so we did it

626
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:05,840
experiment in 10 nursery are in Taiwan

627
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:10,269
so we found that to have a good good

628
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:13,519
quality the median EC must below are

629
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:17,539
point nine something like that so then

630
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:20,929
we are concluded that the fertilizer

631
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:25,460
grade at 100 pata Miam nitrogen was

632
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:29,000
about right under the medium ec r can be

633
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,088
target at one point zero if we are doing

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,599
that by pull through so I gave this

635
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:38,960
recommendation to the grower so the

636
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,570
target ec r is one point zero this is

637
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,418
Simon per meter if they are doing that I

638
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:47,000
pull through and the kind of another

639
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:50,809
girl I like to use a facility like this

640
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,139
so if if they are using a delta t WT

641
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:57,289
sensor the target EC is one point one

642
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:59,800
kind of we do the regression between the

643
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:03,230
eight how we obtain from this our

644
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,680
facility under that from post room so

645
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:12,320
then after this then we kind of tested

646
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:15,889
this idea a more than seven salah/prayer

647
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,440
seven zero zero zero pen so kind of we

648
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:21,139
got good result and very very confident

649
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,179
about this recommendation or to the are

650
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:25,989
fair

651
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:30,848
of course so then here comes to my

652
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:34,568
conclusion that this is the deficiency

653
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:38,500
cistern for nitrogen for phosphorus

654
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:41,048
under for potassium so it's kind of a

655
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,150
little bit similar with other crop but

656
00:35:41,048 --> 00:35:45,940
they are something different they are

657
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,760
they have a very very good capacity or

658
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,460
two stone nitrogen under sometime the

659
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,430
symptoms are different because it

660
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:59,500
nitrogen unknown is the symptom of the

661
00:35:54,429 --> 00:36:02,969
atashi 'm deficiency appear under belief

662
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:06,639
so can the deficiency was very very

663
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:10,000
severe and the further sink on the sauce

664
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:13,150
relationship for nitrogen on the newly

665
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,480
grown organ is the major sink during the

666
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:19,000
vegetative growth under the info

667
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,150
resonance is the major or natural gene

668
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,139
think our orinda or reproductive stage

669
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:30,160
under what organ acts as the nitrogen

670
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:34,868
source is the mature live under the root

671
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:37,618
so and the kind of they are very very

672
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:40,568
good on kind of student nutrient

673
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:43,150
understood nitrogen so even a very very

674
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:46,058
young plant they can store the nitrogen

675
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:50,068
for more than one year and they useful

676
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:52,778
that the development of the Phalaenopsis

677
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:55,588
so on the because the fertilizer

678
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:58,659
nitrogen applied during the for superior

679
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:01,480
accountable the 57 percent of the

680
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:05,440
nitrogen in info racers so it's very

681
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,960
very important to keep get given the

682
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,670
fair analysis attempt read on nitrogen

683
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:16,470
or fertilizer under although we can

684
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:19,599
change the CN ratio by the reduction of

685
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:23,259
nitrogen during the forcing period but

686
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,798
that has a kind of little effect on the

687
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,920
flowering of the fair analysis if they

688
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:32,858
have already stole a lot of money

689
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,720
Trojans so maybe by doing this the

690
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:35,949
quantity of the fed NRC will be

691
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,419
sacrified so

692
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:43,089
I don't recommend to reduce the nitrogen

693
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:46,150
during the fourth in our period so

694
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:48,700
because they are epified underlay cannot

695
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,650
tolerate too high salt but we have to

696
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:53,559
give them a continuous supply of

697
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,289
nitrogen so I will recommend Agora to

698
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:59,349
test the medium easy under it could be

699
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:05,139
targeted at 1.0 by paw through and the

700
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:08,409
1.1 by the delta t weg sensor so this is

701
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:10,989
what I want to share with you and I I

702
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:14,170
thank very much for the invitation to be

703
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:16,599
here to kind of see de Ithaca kind of

704
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:19,720
see the campus again and I think my

705
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:23,799
students all conducted the experiment

706
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:27,639
and I also thank the financial support

707
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,830
from Taiwan government so nice oh my

708
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,469
talk and I thank you for your attention

709
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:36,119
and I would like to have your comment or

710
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:43,799
take any of you a question thank you

711
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:43,799
[Applause]

712
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,870
okay niebo are there any questions from

713
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:58,080
Geneva the best crowd here has no

714
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:58,079
questions

715
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:14,050
thank you the first place look at

716
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,970
concentrations lower than one yes yes in

717
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:20,470
different kind of a stoppie

718
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:23,619
so not in this one okay yeah so we check

719
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:26,980
something like 50 25 but because kind of

720
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:35,969
is kind of another experiment so I

721
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:38,650
didn't brought up here you know you

722
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:46,480
differentiate it for like fertilizer

723
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:49,190
nitrogen from store store not yes like

724
00:39:46,480 --> 00:40:03,230
you know when you grow the plant

725
00:39:49,190 --> 00:40:07,130
any medium mm-hmm yes kind of I kind of

726
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:10,639
yes yeah sometime we cannot do all that

727
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:13,818
influence from the substrate I here

728
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:16,129
because we are compared in that kind of

729
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:19,159
both treatment they were in all our

730
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:22,579
second most but we do the laboring a

731
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:26,000
different time is some kinda odd effect

732
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:30,048
of the specular most yeah if we just

733
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,989
kind of of course for the kind of kind

734
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:34,969
of the deficiency of nitrogen is

735
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:37,788
difficult because it will take even

736
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:40,788
longer because layers some on nitrogen

737
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:43,880
in a substrate but for kind of the older

738
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:48,020
nitrogen 15 study is okay because they

739
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,579
both have the same substrate yeah so we

740
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:54,440
have to think about the nitrogen that

741
00:40:51,579 --> 00:41:15,619
that was provided by the speaker no more

742
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:21,500
so very good point okay so yes that's

743
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:24,650
also a very good question okay so Kaito

744
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:28,068
the gentleman asked kind of the nitrogen

745
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:30,470
form will have some effect on the kind

746
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:33,679
of course of the Friday of fair analysis

747
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:37,429
under within the research and the kind

748
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:40,250
of the best kind of racial the nitrogen

749
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:44,149
form is kind of the nitrous should be

750
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:47,150
high so something like morning are 75%

751
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:50,360
so fair enough scroll quite well our

752
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:56,119
with high nitrate so

753
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:59,630
75% nitrate all 100% natural they just

754
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,759
don't like that much of ammonia and the

755
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,789
the other says is when we are talking

756
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,930
about on nitrogen form we have to

757
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:11,449
consider the pH but if you go to a fair

758
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:15,109
analysis you will always find a very

759
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:18,259
very low pH using a second most as a

760
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:22,160
substrate the ph t''i the ph could be as

761
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,860
though as 2.8 2.9 it's very very

762
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:28,159
difficult for us to image ah it's a

763
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:32,690
reality so but actually for from my

764
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:36,440
study the the fertilizer will make the

765
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:39,289
pH low and the most important factor is

766
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,599
the dude of Phalaenopsis the dutiful

767
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:44,779
alphadon abscess will make the substrate

768
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,170
more acid under tongue to the pH of 3

769
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:50,390
they just like some acid environment I

770
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,539
think it's because fairness is the up

771
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:56,210
fire they just do their best to acquire

772
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:59,500
nutrient so they they made reduce

773
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:02,690
something acid to exchange for the

774
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,480
nutrient so that's what I know about a

775
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:13,190
nitrogen form

776
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:16,039
thank you I do use the terms auto fire

777
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:22,570
to your immobilization for the nitrogen

778
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:22,570
that store no I didn't check that yeah

779
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:38,840
yes oh tissue culture and when I was

780
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,829
doing research I was very very picky for

781
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:46,720
the you uniformity of the plan so I buy

782
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:51,380
the most expensive primitive range I one

783
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:56,119
under then kind of if I need 200 pen I

784
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:59,510
will buy 250 print under then for some

785
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:02,690
research for the length of the first Lib

786
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,140
I even make them all the same the number

787
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,900
of the

788
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:08,629
the size of the festive ebin all the

789
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:22,160
same so they are very very beautiful or

790
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:25,160
prime material no kind of because they

791
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,498
are some micro right on a micro right

792
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:31,038
rather kind of they are important for

793
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:35,449
the termination and the termination of

794
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:37,789
the OTC and an early stage of the OTC

795
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:41,058
during commercially we can just use

796
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:43,369
fertilizer to have a good growth of the

797
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:56,960
Phalaenopsis so we don't need to do that

798
00:44:43,369 --> 00:45:00,019
during the tissue culture stage I

799
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,720
believe so because kind of in a very

800
00:45:00,018 --> 00:45:05,298
very beginning I assure you that we give

801
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,368
different rate of nitrogen are different

802
00:45:05,298 --> 00:45:10,579
rate of phosphorous and different rate

803
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:13,489
of potassium kind of nippy behaviors

804
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:16,309
very very are similar so from my

805
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:18,470
research I demoed demonstrate is a kind

806
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:21,349
of large pool of stone nitrogen I

807
00:45:18,469 --> 00:45:24,709
believe it's the same for other are

808
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,499
adamant so novel a response to the UH

809
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:37,338
Neutron deficit of deficiency who are

810
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:40,429
very very similar I mean this they also

811
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:43,099
have a kind of the storage of function

812
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:46,368
of potassium because with a very very

813
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:49,099
healthy plan you withheld the potassium

814
00:45:46,369 --> 00:46:06,940
for one and a half year yes they will do

815
00:45:49,099 --> 00:46:06,940
it good yes okay okay I would see that

816
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:12,558
is that we have heard of an herbaceous

817
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:15,349
plant that takes two years to do an

818
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:20,600
experiment on my line so it's not just

819
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:24,250
apple trees so Alex thank you very much

820
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:27,289
well thank you okay thank you thank you
