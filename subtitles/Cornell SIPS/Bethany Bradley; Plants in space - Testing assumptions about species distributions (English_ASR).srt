00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,650
thanks so much Steven thanks so much for

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,990
having me here it's really a pleasure to

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,320
be out here so as Steve said my

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,910
background is in geography so I tend to

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,990
you know be interested in something like

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,329
this that you see in the background

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,609
slide here this is an invasion of Sahara

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,879
mustard and the Mojave Desert out in the

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,618
western US but I rarely get the chance

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,689
to actually see any of these things in

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,420
the field because for the most part what

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,920
I do is use data that other people have

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,950
collected from the field to try to

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,710
understand stuff about spatial

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,890
distributions of either distributions or

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,558
abundance of species

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,299
so what biogeography is and that was

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,820
kind of an introduction to it but

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,669
biogeography is basically trying to use

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,308
the distributions of species to learn

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,679
something more about the biology of

24
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:00,448
those species about the ecology how

25
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,640
those species interact with native

26
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,250
communities if we're talking about an

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,340
invasive species like oriental

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,959
bittersweet evolution of those species

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,400
how those species have interacted over

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:17,339
larger time or adaptations to global

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,890
change so we're really saying alright

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,540
people have gone out and collected all

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,689
of these locations where we know that

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,300
species exist and what can that

35
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:31,890
information tell us about in this case

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,629
invasion risk of a species and there is

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,099
an assumption in biogeography and

38
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,659
particularly when we're talking about

39
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,199
regional scale but this affects

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,670
landscape scale models as well but

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,409
basically the distribution of this

42
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,500
species whatever the species is that

43
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,049
you're seeing over here is a reasonable

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,719
approximation of where that species

45
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,090
could be so basically where the suitable

46
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,700
climate is for that species is described

47
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,810
pretty well by where that species is

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,730
right now and that assumption that the

49
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,590
distribution of a species is a good

50
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,480
approximation of where that species

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,610
could be of suitable climate for that

52
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,400
species has been used for a number of

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,920
different papers these ones are you know

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,230
now probably classic papers when you're

55
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,939
talking about global change and species

56
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:22,069
movement and species distributions to

57
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,199
it's things like what species are likely

58
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,750
to go extinct associated with climate

59
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,000
change right there they're here now but

60
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,150
but under warming temperatures and

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,710
altered precipitation the richness or

62
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,450
diversity of species that any one of

63
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,530
these red spots could decrease because

64
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,209
you know because we know what their

65
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,680
ranges are now and you know or we're

66
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,360
predicting what their ranges might be in

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,230
the future that's been done in Europe

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,850
and Mexico globally this assumption of

69
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:51,619
the distributions of species are a good

70
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:53,239
approximation for suitable climate has

71
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,300
also been done for activities like

72
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,460
predicting or assigning conservation

73
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,090
priorities so you know where are the

74
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,879
species now and how does that what does

75
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,189
that tell us about where they could be

76
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:10,359
where lots of them are likely to overlap

77
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:12,650
and these kind of red and yellow areas

78
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,880
it's also been done so this is an

79
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,069
example that that I've done on modeling

80
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,159
potential for invasion with climate

81
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:24,109
change so in this case you've got kudzu

82
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
which is really about us down in the

83
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,590
southeast us right you can see the end

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,300
of that car this is actually a house

85
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,400
under air rights they're not a place

86
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,189
that you want to live if you've got kids

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,219
you in your backyard and this is just an

88
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:39,289
example showing expansion of kids you up

89
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,810
into the Northeast into New York and in

90
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:45,409
Massachusetts where I'm from by the end

91
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,689
of this century with climate change but

92
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,579
again all of these are based on this

93
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,609
assumption that distribution is a good

94
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,200
approximation of suitable climate and so

95
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,390
what I want to do in you know I'm going

96
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,909
to get a little wonky here I think into

97
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,549
the biogeography side of things but but

98
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:03,139
holding to that application of really

99
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,550
what all of this is trying to get at is

100
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,159
how much are we going to trust and in

101
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,469
what cases should we be trusting spatial

102
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,819
models to really inform what we're doing

103
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:12,830
on the ground are monitoring our

104
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,479
management everything else so I'm going

105
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,150
to look at two different questions today

106
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,358
the first one is a question of

107
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,979
comparative equilibrium so how how much

108
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,560
are those species distributions

109
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,290
approximating climate for native versus

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,240
non-native plants and then we're going

111
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,580
to explore the native plants a little

112
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,150
bit further in the second half and ask

113
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,609
whether native plant range

114
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:39,389
are really describing their climatic

115
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,129
tolerance um and so the to start on that

116
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,079
first one the equilibrium assumption and

117
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,990
this is really fundamental to a lot of

118
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:49,399
biogeography equilibrium assumption says

119
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,900
going back to Hutchinson's paper of 1957

120
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,089
species is in equilibrium with its

121
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,069
environment when its present basically

122
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:59,219
everywhere that it could be all of the

123
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,259
suitable areas but not present or absent

124
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,520
and all of the areas that are unsuitable

125
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,800
for that species right and so if we're

126
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,620
doing any kind of model based on whether

127
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,110
it's climatic suitability or other you

128
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,939
know suitability of the soils or other

129
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,430
features of a landscape for a species

130
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,680
we're assuming that this is true for

131
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,209
that species that it is present where it

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,680
could be present and absent where it

133
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:27,719
cannot be present but the problem with

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,819
any kind of distribution model is that

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,330
we could always be missing something

136
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,819
right

137
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:35,459
so if our model is based on all of these

138
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:38,219
gray points in here and we're missing

139
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:41,069
these you know green points of out over

140
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,140
here then the model that we're gonna

141
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:45,209
create is not going to be an accurate

142
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,370
representation of the temperature and

143
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,919
precipitation conditions that this

144
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,449
species could exist in right so why

145
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,009
might be you mean we'd be missing the

146
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:56,550
species out here well it could be

147
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,930
because we just didn't survey that area

148
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,540
we're missing a couple of points that

149
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,550
the species actually exists in it could

150
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,860
be that it's some sort of you know an

151
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,829
invasive species that started out over

152
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,620
here and just hasn't expanded those

153
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:12,599
areas yet it could be that these

154
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,540
temperature and precipitation conditions

155
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,189
don't currently exist on our landscape

156
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,200
but they might under future climate

157
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,290
conditions and so how do we deal with

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,170
those kind of challenges in the modeling

159
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,700
framework so for invasive species in

160
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,830
particular this assumption of

161
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,550
equilibrium the assumption that a

162
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:34,589
species is describing its full niche its

163
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,740
full area that it could that it could

164
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,479
particularly persist in is fundamentally

165
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,980
flawed for an invasive species right

166
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,900
because we know that invasive species

167
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,450
are spreading across landscapes they're

168
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,829
spreading across regions this is an

169
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,829
example of the

170
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:52,680
kudzu beetle this guy over here which

171
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:54,389
does in fact eat kudzu I'm told but it

172
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,980
also eats soybeans so that's the

173
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,379
drawback of why we're concerned about

174
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,170
this particular pest and this is just

175
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:04,259
the spread between 2009 and 2012 right

176
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:07,230
so really broad scale spread of that

177
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,870
particular pest if you only considered

178
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,850
the distribution of where it was in the

179
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,889
early stage of an infestation then you

180
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,020
probably be missing a large scale and in

181
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,569
fact even out to 2012 is probably

182
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:24,479
missing to a large degree where that

183
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:26,399
species could specifically exist so what

184
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,319
we're gonna do is is try to tackle this

185
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,870
question for invasive plants

186
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,120
specifically so we're asking how bad is

187
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,550
this equilibrium assumption how far off

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,129
are we in general when we're talking

189
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,889
about invasive plants from equilibrium

190
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:44,430
with the with the environment and this

191
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:46,949
is from a paper published almost two

192
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,480
years ago in global ecology and by a

193
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,360
geography if you're interested in the

194
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,700
more details but the way we wanted to go

195
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,199
about this is we know that there's never

196
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,670
any species that's going to be in

197
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,079
perfect equilibrium right there's always

198
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,689
going to be someplace that species

199
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,789
either wasn't able to get to or that

200
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,219
space high matically doesn't exist yet

201
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,200
or something like that so there's no way

202
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,750
that we can define this perfect

203
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,909
equilibrium but what we can do is we can

204
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,459
compare native and invasive species and

205
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,320
say relative to each other how far off

206
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,969
or invasive species right how much

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,209
should we be worried about missing

208
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,390
something in terms of our modeling of

209
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:27,299
invasive plants and so here's our

210
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:30,509
hypothesis our hypothesis is that for a

211
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,729
native plant they have had lots and lots

212
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,899
of time you know so if we you know even

213
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,440
just going back to the last glacial

214
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,179
maximum we say 20,000 plus years for

215
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,530
these species to move around and other

216
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,109
places that were less affected by

217
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,600
glaciation you've got way more time for

218
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,730
them to move around and so for a given

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,560
number of occurrences we would expect

220
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,110
that those species of native species

221
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,819
would be more widely distributed and

222
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,580
that they would also have a larger

223
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,770
modeled potential range based on that

224
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,629
broad distribution and contrasts

225
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:05,169
we might hypothesize that non-native

226
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:07,870
plants including invasive plants would

227
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,459
have a much smaller distribution

228
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,279
relative with the same number of

229
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:16,030
occurrences and a smaller modeled

230
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,579
potential range and that those two

231
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,159
things we could sort of say all right

232
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,009
that also affects the longitudinal and

233
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:25,719
latitudinal extent of those species that

234
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,850
that your native species you would

235
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,029
expect to be more widespread and your

236
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,100
and your non-native species so this is

237
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,980
just a way of presenting that previous

238
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,990
graph in terms of some line graphs and

239
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,550
of course as you increase the number of

240
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,139
occurrences you would expect both of

241
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:43,779
these things to go up in terms of your

242
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:45,340
overall potential range but we would

243
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,740
expect that the native species would be

244
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,210
higher overall than than the non natives

245
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,430
so how did we test this we went about

246
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,600
testing this using all of the plants

247
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:58,059
that we could find within the

248
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,820
continental US so we downloaded the

249
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:04,719
whole list of plants from the USDA

250
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,940
plants database that's actually closer

251
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,490
to about 20,000 species that you find

252
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,340
within the continental US

253
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,610
the USDA breaks those into native

254
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,670
species endemic species alien so these

255
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,590
are non-native species and then from the

256
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:22,779
alien ones we also separated out the

257
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,750
invasive species based on ones that are

258
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:28,839
either noxious weeds or identified as

259
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,200
invasive plants on invasive plant atlas

260
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,850
of the US and endemics USDA doesn't

261
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,680
actually break that down so endemics we

262
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,710
got from another database and separated

263
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,229
those out as well in case something

264
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,000
interesting was happening and then we

265
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,279
looked at so we cross-reference that

266
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,230
database against all of the herbarium

267
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,939
records that are available in this

268
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,920
global biodiversity information facility

269
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,650
repository for global or barium records

270
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,110
so lots of states regions are putting

271
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:00,429
their data into that repository these

272
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,399
are where the plants have actually been

273
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:06,069
found and someone has a geographical

274
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,649
latitude longitude record of where those

275
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:11,920
species came from and that ended up with

276
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,028
our 13 585 total species that actually

277
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,639
had

278
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:17,220
enough records in the global

279
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,509
biodiversity information facility

280
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,649
database that we could create a

281
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:26,709
reasonable model based on and so the

282
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,139
analysis of this was that we took a

283
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:31,239
particular species so all these circles

284
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,899
are the location of that particular

285
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,230
species we have a pretty simple PCA

286
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,818
based model to look at potential range

287
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,850
of those species which is showing up in

288
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:44,528
here in this kind of late yellow color

289
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:47,470
and we said potential range is just a

290
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:49,958
count of all of these pixels these

291
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,560
yellow areas of where that species could

292
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,359
potentially be located and then we

293
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,399
looked at one other thing we looked at

294
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,589
range infilling which is basically the

295
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,629
ratio of where all of these species are

296
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,819
present to all of these areas where it

297
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,860
could be present because we thought well

298
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:07,778
we're thinking about invasive species in

299
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,949
particular can we say something about

300
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:13,740
more invasion likely on the horizon

301
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:18,219
associated with where it is relative to

302
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,769
where it could be so just to go back to

303
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,009
that hypothesis again so look first at

304
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,470
latitudinal and longitudinal ranges so

305
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,509
our prediction again is that our native

306
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,910
species both native and endemic species

307
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:34,870
together should be more widespread

308
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:37,000
they've had way more time you know to

309
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,919
spread across landscapes and regions in

310
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,318
which they could have climatic

311
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,229
suitability than our relatively recently

312
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:45,938
introduced invasive and alien species so

313
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,789
there's our prediction and here's our

314
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:51,578
result exactly the opposite of what we

315
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:55,870
predicted so whereas we thought our

316
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:58,778
natives and endemics or I guess I should

317
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,818
say that anytime you read biogeography

318
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,679
literature related to invasive species

319
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:04,838
you always have this kind of clause at

320
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,159
the beginning that says oh we know that

321
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,240
invasive species are not at equilibrium

322
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,769
so this is probably under prediction so

323
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,659
what we're seeing is actually the exact

324
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,730
opposite that it's our natives and

325
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:18,669
endemic species that are much more

326
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:22,209
narrowly distributed both longitudinally

327
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:23,889
and latitudinal II not a significant

328
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,508
difference between our invasives and our

329
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,560
aliens or between our natives and

330
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,990
endemics

331
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:33,008
between the two groups a very strong and

332
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,720
significant difference that second

333
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,818
hypothesis you guys could probably

334
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,069
figure out where we're going on this one

335
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:41,438
that the potential range then of native

336
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:44,019
species would be greater on average than

337
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:47,019
non-native species note we find exactly

338
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,058
the opposite that as you have increasing

339
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,159
occurrences of either non native or

340
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:53,110
native species you're seeing this

341
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:55,448
increase in potential range that you

342
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,579
might expect but consistently it's the

343
00:13:55,448 --> 00:14:00,609
non-native species and non-natives and

344
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:03,188
the invasives that are higher up in

345
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:07,300
terms of the modeled potential range

346
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:09,610
then our native plants are and so we're

347
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,109
fundamentally rejecting this hypothesis

348
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,509
or this sort of framing that it's

349
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,300
actually that non native plants are

350
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:19,028
really not at equilibrium with climate

351
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:21,519
in fact what we're seeing is compared to

352
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:23,169
native plants arguably it's the

353
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,209
non-native plants that are closer to

354
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:27,549
climatic equilibrium the non-native

355
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:33,250
plants that are probably creating better

356
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:36,399
models of distribution of risk of rain

357
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:39,250
shifts associated with with climate

358
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,889
change and so why is that okay so

359
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,448
probably the reason is because we are

360
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:47,500
really good at introducing invasive

361
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:49,838
plants right most of we know that most

362
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,778
of the population of invasive plants in

363
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,319
the u.s. six at least 60% probably more

364
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:56,879
than that

365
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:59,318
are introduced as ornamental plants

366
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,740
certainly a much higher proportion of

367
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:05,409
that for our non-native non invasive

368
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,659
plants are introduced as ornamentals and

369
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:10,088
so here's an example of this is a

370
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:13,688
centaurea species so bachelor button

371
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,429
bachelors button this is declared as a

372
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:17,528
noxious weed and the southeast part of

373
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:19,928
the US I think in Tennessee but is

374
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:22,870
obviously really widespread introduced

375
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:25,360
and planted in our gardens across the US

376
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,188
and its potential range as you can see

377
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,039
from that light yellow really really

378
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:33,698
broad because it's inhabiting all of

379
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:35,198
these different climate conditions can

380
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:39,219
compare that so here's your bachelor

381
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,269
button with 458 occurrences this species

382
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,420
is getting pretty much

383
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:45,490
the entire us it takes almost double

384
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:48,099
that number of occurrences for the

385
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,100
average native species to get even close

386
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,680
to that and it's not even fully getting

387
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,259
there in terms of the full range so even

388
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,629
our most common native species are still

389
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:02,129
showing much more of this clumping

390
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:08,500
bunching than our kind of average

391
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:10,509
non-native or invasive oops so range

392
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,100
filling was that other question okay and

393
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:15,220
you guys can probably guess based on the

394
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,930
way these these graphs look range in

395
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,089
filling is that question of how much

396
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:21,219
more space is there to go how much more

397
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,230
can the species extend so here's our

398
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,930
native species you can see that there is

399
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,480
still a fair bit of of this late yellow

400
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:30,159
space of within its potential range but

401
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,980
for the invasive species there's tons of

402
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,469
that light yellow potential range so if

403
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,720
we look at range in filling we're seeing

404
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,639
that that the native species are much

405
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,190
more kind of clumped together and have

406
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,470
infilled within their ranges whereas the

407
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,470
invasive species not at all

408
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,379
and so for the average invasive plant

409
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:53,470
the average invasive plant is filling in

410
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,200
only half as much of its potential range

411
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,839
relative to the average native species

412
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,430
right so if we think that it your

413
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,170
average invasive plant is going to

414
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:04,000
behave like your average native plant

415
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:06,639
then that means that we are currently

416
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,009
only about halfway there in terms of the

417
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,319
amount of spread within landscapes or

418
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:15,549
within those regions that these plants

419
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:18,308
could potentially do so here's an

420
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:20,529
example this is a bamboo species where

421
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:22,779
you know care all of the locations where

422
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:24,609
this bamboo has been introduced and we

423
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,318
know and in fact this is up into New

424
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,319
Jersey as well and there are a bunch of

425
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,428
you know pictures of people already

426
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,529
getting angry at their neighbors for

427
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,780
planting bamboo that's coming into their

428
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:37,629
into their yards so we know that that

429
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:39,399
these species are likely to this guy up

430
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:43,360
here in New Jersey was pretty angry

431
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,009
about his neighbors bamboo and here

432
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,719
we've got some of you know natural

433
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:49,690
spaces and open spaces that are already

434
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,850
being taken over by that species which

435
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:55,080
is an ornamental plant that's widely

436
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:59,889
widely planted across

437
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:01,569
um so that tells us which is really from

438
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,780
a biogeography perspective this is

439
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:06,519
really interesting because because it

440
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,769
tells us kind of two things one it tells

441
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,799
us that actually a lot of our risk

442
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:13,329
assessments for invasive plants relative

443
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,450
to climate and relative to climate

444
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:18,099
change are probably pretty good or at

445
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,830
least pretty good relative to natives

446
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:23,289
but it also tells us that the natives

447
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:24,699
are projections relative to climate

448
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,920
change might be a little bit sketchy

449
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,870
right because the natives are are not

450
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,269
apparently distributed and and

451
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:35,439
facilitated by us in terms of being

452
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:37,900
introduced in all of these places so for

453
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,580
invasive plants unlike the what we had

454
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,100
expected the invasive plants are

455
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:45,099
actually very widespread it could be

456
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:47,279
considered much closer to this climatic

457
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:50,079
equilibrium than the native plants are

458
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,910
but we also see that there is really low

459
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,579
range filling associated with invasive

460
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:57,220
plants and so there's probably a lot

461
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:59,619
more of these landscape scale invasions

462
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,630
that we should expect on the horizon as

463
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:05,379
if we don't have enough data to deal

464
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,360
with great so that was the first

465
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,050
question so I kind of alluded to the

466
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:14,500
second question when I said that the the

467
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:16,419
equilibrium analysis that we did left

468
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,150
this kind of question about what's going

469
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,759
on with native species right if we start

470
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,080
out with this framing that says invasive

471
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,569
species are the ones that are not at

472
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,799
equilibrium and now we're saying well

473
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:29,079
actually it looks like it's native

474
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,779
species that are less like equilibrium

475
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:34,599
that raises the question of well how

476
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,970
well our native species doing how well

477
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,359
our plants ranges within their native

478
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,710
native ranges describing so sort of

479
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,919
going after that same question but their

480
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,579
climatic tolerance or their their

481
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,920
equilibrium in that case with climate

482
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,720
and there are some there have been there

483
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,350
is ongoing kind of large-scale

484
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,690
discussion of this question both within

485
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:01,750
well particularly within the invasive

486
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:05,590
plant literature this is a paper from I

487
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,450
think 2011 where what they were looking

488
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:09,459
at was basically you have a bunch of

489
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,759
issues that come from Europe and they're

490
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,259
moving to North America North America to

491
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,879
Europe is in this one and Europe to

492
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,190
North America is in this one and

493
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,019
basically the blue on here are areas

494
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,630
that are where that species is

495
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:25,599
inhabiting the same climate space both

496
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,789
in Europe and in North America so these

497
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,829
guys are mostly blue mostly blue on both

498
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:32,619
of these like a little bit of area where

499
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:34,480
the species is expanding its climatic

500
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:37,599
niche basically as it moves from one

501
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,940
continent to another but they're their

502
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:43,329
underlying statement here was that it's

503
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,820
pretty rare for a species to change its

504
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:47,589
climate space basically you know if

505
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,329
you've got a species in Europe and it's

506
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:51,459
within this particular temperature and

507
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,259
precipitation regime you move it to

508
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,610
North America for the most part it's

509
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:57,220
going to be within the same temperature

510
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:59,648
and precipitation regime and that would

511
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,929
suggest if that's the case for invasive

512
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:03,969
species that suggests that for most

513
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,788
species you know like if you've got a

514
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,889
given temperature and climatic regime

515
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:10,629
and that's probably what that species

516
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:13,719
can persist under right so this is

517
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,809
arguing for equilibrium or close to

518
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,750
equilibrium for these range shifting

519
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:21,668
plants there is another study that was

520
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,470
published only a couple years after that

521
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:26,070
they came to basically the exact

522
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:29,798
opposite conclusion but also looked for

523
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:32,888
species that were native to Europe and

524
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:34,898
shifting into North America and

525
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:37,449
basically in this case all of the orange

526
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:41,619
areas are ones where there was this

527
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:44,620
climatic niche expansion and that's most

528
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:46,928
of North America had this niche

529
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:49,239
expansion so these two papers are

530
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:51,850
basically arguing the exact opposite

531
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,429
conclusions with this you know what

532
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:57,158
seemingly similar set of species that

533
00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:00,788
are moving from Europe to North America

534
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,679
and vice-versa so so that is sort of

535
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:05,408
fundamental to this this question as

536
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:08,679
well of well how much are native species

537
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,929
generally in equilibrium with climate

538
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,130
conditions and this is a paper that was

539
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,340
published about a year ago if you guys

540
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,230
want more of the details was actually

541
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:19,240
our first author and this was a UMass

542
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,610
undergraduate student who compiled all

543
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,558
of the data for this

544
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:26,569
so here's our hypothesis our hypothesis

545
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:30,048
is we're just gonna look at species that

546
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:32,210
are native to the US and this species

547
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:34,148
for example if Texas said we're gonna

548
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,919
assume that that has a particular

549
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:38,750
climatic tolerance associated that can

550
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,240
be described based on its native range

551
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,388
and then if that species of Texas says

552
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,159
we're moved over to Nevada or California

553
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:49,579
that it would be within the same

554
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,130
climatic conditions as are found in its

555
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:57,259
native range so here we are looking

556
00:22:52,130 --> 00:23:01,190
specifically at species that are native

557
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:03,470
to the US so described by this biota of

558
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,298
North America program but also have

559
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,350
advent of range so basically a

560
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:11,750
non-native range within the US as well

561
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:14,028
these are almost all exclusively species

562
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:17,349
that are within the ornamental plant

563
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:19,940
industry so they are cultivated species

564
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:22,908
that have been taken from parts of the

565
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,639
US and planted elsewhere in the US and

566
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:27,200
so what we did was we looked for all of

567
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:30,379
the occurrence data that we could find

568
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,110
within both global biodiversity

569
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,679
information facility is one source we

570
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:38,778
also because not all herb area are up to

571
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,309
date in terms of reporting there looked

572
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:42,500
at a whole bunch of different regional

573
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:46,339
orb area for any occurrence data that we

574
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,599
can find in both the native range as

575
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:52,699
well as this advent of introduced range

576
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,740
and we know the advent of range because

577
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,169
the biota of North America program tells

578
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,759
us where its native range is and then we

579
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,130
compare the climate conditions between

580
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,898
those two locations so are the areas

581
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,120
where it's been introduced outside of

582
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:07,058
its native range under similar climate

583
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,619
conditions to the ones where its native

584
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:13,428
so here's an example of a species this

585
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:16,069
is a China this virginica sits a white

586
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:18,320
fringe tree or something like that

587
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:20,480
so what you see on this map are the

588
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,138
light blue areas are all of the counties

589
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,839
that this tree is native to all across

590
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:28,908
the southeast and then we have all of

591
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,859
the occurrence locations that we have in

592
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:33,019
the dark blue dots as well as the red

593
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:34,419
dots the dark blue dots are the ones

594
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,609
where

595
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,710
the occurrence of that species is within

596
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:40,689
its native range and the red dots are

597
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,930
the ones where the appearance is outside

598
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,430
of its native range including up in New

599
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,980
York and Massachusetts and Connecticut

600
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,860
stuff like that and also including up

601
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,890
here in the Pacific Northwest where that

602
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:55,419
species has been introduced and so

603
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,800
here's what we find with that particular

604
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,200
species which probably doesn't surprise

605
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,519
you too much looking at this map we know

606
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,049
that the conditions in New York and

607
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,670
Connecticut and Massachusetts are pretty

608
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:08,319
different from you know the climate

609
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:10,480
conditions down here that generally what

610
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:14,200
we see for this particular species is

611
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,759
that it can it is persisting in these

612
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,730
areas where it's been introduced in

613
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:22,299
areas that are cooler than its native

614
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,769
range and also slightly drier so you

615
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,750
know a couple of points in areas that

616
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:28,299
are slightly drier than its native range

617
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,279
so the Reds on here are all of those

618
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,079
advent of the introduce points in the

619
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,759
blue on here are all of the native

620
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,470
points and you can see that there's also

621
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,940
plenty of overlap so there are lots of

622
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,620
climate conditions and the advent of

623
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,710
range that are well represented within

624
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:44,169
the native range but definitely a little

625
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,329
bit cooler a little bit drier on here so

626
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:50,380
how does that compare to the overall

627
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:53,259
number of species so remember we had 144

628
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,500
species that we were working with 90 of

629
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:57,879
those showed lower precipitation in the

630
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,369
areas where they were introduced

631
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,640
relative to their native range and the

632
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:04,929
median decrease I don't know what the

633
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,960
right word is the median amount of

634
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:10,029
precipitation lower than its native

635
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,670
range was 23 centimeters which is pretty

636
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:14,019
substantive I've done a lot of work in

637
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,420
the western US and there are a lot of

638
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:19,960
places that barely get 23 centimeters of

639
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,500
rain so that's pretty substantive and 90

640
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,350
out of 144 species are showing that

641
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,250
expansion of drought tolerance we're

642
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:31,509
also seeing 56 of the species 56 of our

643
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,480
hundred and forty-four showed an

644
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:36,160
expansion of heat tolerance with the

645
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,309
median amount being one point two

646
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:44,200
degrees C warmer part of the reason for

647
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,460
there aren't super number of species

648
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,519
that are that are going in this

649
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,529
direction may just be

650
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,750
geography of the US that there's a lot

651
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:53,960
more space as you go for their north and

652
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,359
then going south if you look at cold

653
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,829
tolerance so we had 80 out of a hundred

654
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,619
and forty four species showed an

655
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:03,679
expansion of cold tolerance and a median

656
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,989
of 2.9 degrees C different in terms of

657
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,630
that climatic range that could be

658
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,339
described and then that last piece was

659
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,200
that we also modeled the potential range

660
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:15,409
of all of these species right so here's

661
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,289
for that one particular species so China

662
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:21,800
this Inachus the blue is its potential

663
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:24,349
range based on just its native range and

664
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,450
the red is its potential range based on

665
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:28,609
the native plus the advent of range

666
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,009
right so you see in that case we're

667
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:34,459
getting divided by it up into its New

668
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:36,859
England and further north from that that

669
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:41,690
native Southeast range so that's one

670
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:45,079
species on average 128 of our 144

671
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:47,120
species showed an expansion of of their

672
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,240
potential range when you considered both

673
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,429
the native and the advent of points the

674
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,490
median amount of expansion was 35

675
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,500
percent or 700,000 square kilometers

676
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,029
which I learned last night is about five

677
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,700
times the size of the state of New York

678
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:04,819
so that's a pretty big area if you're

679
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,440
thinking about you know okay we want to

680
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:08,119
understand how species are likely to

681
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,539
move with climate change and what their

682
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,149
current range is and we're missing five

683
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:16,250
New York states then and that's a that's

684
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:20,420
a pretty big area that that were

685
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,549
underestimated currently so this

686
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,480
hypothesis that we started out with that

687
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:28,789
advent of locations of that species are

688
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,380
good are going to be really similar to

689
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:35,539
the climate space where they started out

690
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:37,820
is not supportive and not supported that

691
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,230
in fact in fact we're seeing yacht's

692
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,730
right so we're trying to dig a little

693
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,339
bit into this well what sort of species

694
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:46,309
are actually expanding the most in terms

695
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:47,899
of their climate space so he said well

696
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,940
maybe if they have more points than the

697
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,200
advent of range that's going to be those

698
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,120
are the species if they've got water

699
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,779
introductions maybe it'll have this

700
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,189
larger range size expansion and we don't

701
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,839
see that at all there's just kind of a

702
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,350
big clump there so it doesn't matter how

703
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,798
many times

704
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:07,308
you've been introduced but what does

705
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:10,279
seem to matter is the size of your

706
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:14,779
native range so for species that had

707
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,970
relatively small areas to begin with as

708
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:20,329
you start introducing points outside of

709
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:23,589
there we very rapidly get you know a big

710
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:27,288
shift in climate space and a much larger

711
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:30,349
predicted range size as you start adding

712
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:33,470
more advent of locations so these

713
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:35,750
species with small native ranges appear

714
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,940
to be less limited by climate that is

715
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,009
climate you know we can make a really

716
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,288
nice model of climate describing their

717
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:44,240
range but it's not actually climate it's

718
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:48,710
limiting those grant the ranges of those

719
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,960
narrow range species and just to go back

720
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,210
to this comparison early on that initial

721
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,669
framing right where you know early in

722
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,319
saks a huge amount of niche expansion

723
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,690
when you move from north america to the

724
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,149
US and petit-pierre say no niche

725
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,700
expansion when you move from Europe to

726
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:08,000
the US when you actually plot those

727
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,130
species together relative to what their

728
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,589
native range size is you see a very

729
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:15,110
similar pattern if you like the

730
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:16,819
petit-pierre study had a really large

731
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:19,069
like you were really wide spread really

732
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:21,200
species all across Europe to begin with

733
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:23,178
you get introduced to North America

734
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,830
you're not expanding much because you're

735
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,740
all over the place to begin with in

736
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:29,808
Europe but in the early in saks paper

737
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,179
they were looking at a lot of species

738
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:35,240
that were much narrow had much narrower

739
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:37,640
ranges in Europe and so they had a lot

740
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,859
more space to expand and climate space

741
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,580
that they were expanding into when they

742
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:46,089
got to the US so if I tell this

743
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:48,769
basically is when we go back to these

744
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:50,389
you know fundamental concerns and

745
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,589
certainly this is a fundamental concern

746
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,380
when we're talking about climate change

747
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:56,449
of what's gonna happen to rare species

748
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:00,049
you know what's happening to these you

749
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:02,120
know really narrow range species this

750
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:04,158
you know this analysis in my and my

751
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,869
current thinking on this is that well

752
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,549
we've done a lot of climate modeling and

753
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:09,558
constructed all of these things for

754
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:10,289
these really small range species but it

755
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:13,230
may actually

756
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:15,690
be they climate is not what's important

757
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,740
for the ranges of those species so that

758
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,390
doesn't mean that they're not still

759
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,789
threatened by climate change if your

760
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,950
narrow range to begin with you've got a

761
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:25,289
lot of other problems going on too and

762
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:28,250
the climate change may very well affect

763
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:32,039
those species in place to a large degree

764
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:34,500
but what it doesn't necessarily mean and

765
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:37,859
what you know these guys had said

766
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,839
previously doesn't necessarily mean that

767
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,240
those species cannot move into a new

768
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,929
climate conditions or expand into into

769
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,460
other parts so our conclusions from this

770
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,880
or that the the native range is

771
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,789
basically especially small range native

772
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,280
species are not doing a good job of

773
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,129
describing climate tolerance or the

774
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,079
native plant pool at least and this may

775
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,390
be a little bit of a silver lining in

776
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,460
terms of projections of risk climate

777
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,950
changed that many of these small range

778
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,710
species if we were to start considering

779
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,990
tools like assisted migration or moving

780
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,329
some of these species in advance of

781
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,019
climate change that those may well be

782
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:21,240
effective mechanisms currently even if a

783
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,970
distribution model or the geography of

784
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,779
its current location would not suggest

785
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:32,400
that it can establish and persist beyond

786
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:35,069
where it currently does so these are

787
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,550
just that to go back to the conclusions

788
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:40,740
of these two studies that spatial

789
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,720
modeling anytime you guys look at a bio

790
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,150
Geographic model any kind any time you

791
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,620
look at a landscape ecology model that's

792
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,350
based on the distribution of species

793
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,659
those are assuming the distribution of

794
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:55,409
that species is reflecting the habitat

795
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:57,540
of that species and so I hope that I've

796
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,830
told you know like I hope that I haven't

797
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,509
convinced you the distribution modeling

798
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:03,179
is proud because there are definitely

799
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:05,339
some good examples to use it for but

800
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,750
what I but I what I want to convince

801
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:09,959
your today is just that there's more

802
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:13,950
nuance to understanding when we should

803
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,450
really believe the models and when we

804
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,819
should you know kind of raise an eyebrow

805
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,910
and say well you know are you sure that

806
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:23,460
that that model is is representative of

807
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,298
the species that I you know only know

808
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,019
and

809
00:33:24,298 --> 00:34:24,389
or 20 or something like that so thanks

810
00:33:28,019 --> 00:34:26,159
so much yeah so this is a real challenge

811
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,750
in terms of just the data that exists

812
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,338
out there right so anytime that you're

813
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,250
dealing with a spatial model for the

814
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:34,500
most part the underlying data are just

815
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,750
points in space and those points could

816
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,309
be occurrences they could be absences

817
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,929
they could have some abundance

818
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:43,559
information in them but that's that's

819
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:46,139
fairly rare there are a lot of folks who

820
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,899
are really trying to get after building

821
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,858
more spatial demographic models

822
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:52,769
understanding interactions between

823
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:55,019
predator prey or insect inside the plant

824
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:57,778
and the challenge about is just like how

825
00:34:55,019 --> 00:35:02,298
do you get both spatial and demographic

826
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:04,440
data of multiple species together and

827
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:06,719
you know I think it's I think it's

828
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,630
coming it's just it's just that we need

829
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:13,818
to really focus our data compilation and

830
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,818
collection in that direction that you

831
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:18,269
yeah and I mean the other challenges

832
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:20,879
that you end up doing it for you know a

833
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:22,318
couple of specific species some of the

834
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,579
great things about just spatial modeling

835
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:25,190
generally is that you can do it for lots

836
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,990
of different species and try to see if

837
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,599
consistent trends emerge such that you

838
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:33,019
can say something you know something

839
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,019
relevant

840
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:40,760
yeah thanks very much I just a question

841
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:45,199
about your native versus attentive

842
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:48,530
distinction so climate is changing did

843
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:51,379
you look at all the data newer with a

844
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:55,310
modified climate compared to the native

845
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,300
data which tend to be that's a really

846
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:58,789
good point

847
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,620
the other question with that paper also

848
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:04,940
is we don't necessarily know that those

849
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:06,529
species are established we we assume

850
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,300
that they are because they're in

851
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,800
herbarium records and herbarium records

852
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,810
generally go for areas that are

853
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,760
relatively natural and not like in the

854
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:17,779
watered you know fields or something

855
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,880
like that I don't I don't know that we

856
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,890
look specifically of for dates on a lot

857
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,630
of those records a lot of the herbarium

858
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:25,609
records that we have are relatively new

859
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:29,059
so there are definitely some that go

860
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,680
back to the 60s 70s or earlier but the

861
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:33,139
big chunk when you actually look at them

862
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,719
are like from the 90s and later on so I

863
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:37,429
think relative to current climate change

864
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,349
that's probably a time period when we

865
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:42,049
say it's been relatively similar for the

866
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,369
last 20 or 30 years when most of those

867
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:55,760
points are coming from but that's a

868
00:36:43,369 --> 00:37:00,289
really good question in comparing the

869
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:05,270
native species within they occur to me

870
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:09,199
that introduced species tend to be

871
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:12,259
introduced because they are clearly the

872
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,219
ornamentals are introduced because they

873
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,540
have a lot

874
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:19,639
climatic elements you know it gives they

875
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:23,179
only live in Florida and their trunk

876
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,579
license and exclusively you know the

877
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:28,399
conduction he's sold all over the United

878
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:35,349
States so there's there's a vector and

879
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,349
the other is related is that the

880
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:41,629
introduced species going to be

881
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:44,230
disturbance Orion they're they're they

882
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,230
all mister

883
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:59,360
be able to run side native species are

884
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:03,280
largely things that existed in

885
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:07,250
undisturbed habitats and so we go around

886
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,019
astronomy habitats and you get these

887
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:17,239
things existing in a lot of different

888
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:18,920
places whereas the natives well I think

889
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,269
that's a really good hypothesis right

890
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,369
you know like but it's one that hasn't

891
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:24,019
necessarily been tested for a lot of the

892
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,509
native species just because we haven't

893
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:28,909
widely introduced tons of these native

894
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,430
species all across you know different

895
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:32,989
parts of the US I mean I agree with you

896
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:34,669
I think that's probably going to be true

897
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:36,799
that your invasives and your meteor

898
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,930
species or disturbance specialists and

899
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,300
that your native species generally or

900
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:42,409
not but I don't know that you know I

901
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,080
don't know that we've actually done a

902
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:50,629
full-scale test to really nail down you

903
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:52,929
know how different how and the yeah your

904
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,590
first part definitely you know the

905
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:56,299
characteristics that we love for

906
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,730
ornamental plants that they're you know

907
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,580
wide climatic tolerance and they grow

908
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,559
fast and you know like produce lots of

909
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:05,090
seeds and you know showy things and

910
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,529
stuff like that are exactly the kind of

911
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,960
things that we worry about in terms of

912
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,670
invasive plants so there is definitely a

913
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,559
lot of overlap between that selection

914
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,950
pressure coming in and what ends up

915
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,900
within the invasive plant population but

916
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:20,149
I really like your question of whether

917
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:25,460
you know how different they are from the

918
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:27,380
native populations in terms of that yeah

919
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:44,449
in terms of the the range in filling in

920
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:46,690
the tenpin creases they're kind of

921
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:50,119
operating in a persecution scale as is

922
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,650
biome scale right so we think about

923
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:53,039
across the landscape we don't see a ton

924
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,470
variation

925
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,750
in temperature it's what's driving the

926
00:39:55,469 --> 00:40:02,509
variation of that spatial scale almost

927
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:07,099
species abundance we think I think

928
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:07,100
fantastic racial cleansing the wheel

929
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:13,349
yeah so what do I mean the null

930
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,719
hypothesis all popular I guess we could

931
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:18,690
go after that one you know disturbance

932
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:21,379
certainly affects them micro habitats

933
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,420
like soil quality is and you know

934
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,910
abiotic local things you know water

935
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,289
availability aspects and slope and stuff

936
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:30,509
like that

937
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:32,340
presumably biotic resistance has

938
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,900
something to do with not necessarily the

939
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,329
distribution of species but certainly

940
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,639
the local abundance of species so the

941
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:41,489
diversity or traits of your native

942
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,170
community might affect those are those

943
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:45,779
are the things that I think about I

944
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,010
don't know and actually Steve and I were

945
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,660
talking about this this morning is like

946
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,250
whether there are data sets out there

947
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,139
and trying to go after data sets that

948
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:56,730
could actually try to answer those

949
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:58,949
questions spatially the minds with face

950
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,079
experiments we see poison ivy Prince

951
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:03,299
outside of the rain easily no poison ivy

952
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,059
decided tonight so clearly if you don't

953
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:12,600
bility to is limiting growth that I'm

954
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:14,489
certainly not even yeseo to certain day

955
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,130
for invasive plants there's consistent

956
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:19,409
trends of co2 facilitating invasive more

957
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,670
so than it does native plants a lot of

958
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:23,069
that I think it's just that going back

959
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:25,289
to like the definition of meatiness of

960
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:29,609
you know fast-growing species like more

961
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:31,769
resources and so absolutely co2 co2 is

962
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:34,139
is a tricky one spatially though because

963
00:41:31,769 --> 00:42:22,500
you know like it's it's for the most

964
00:41:34,139 --> 00:42:26,339
part everywhere I think that's a really

965
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:28,889
fascinating question I have never done

966
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:32,430
any work on native range as well as non

967
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:33,989
native range of invasive plants but

968
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:36,960
there are a lot of people who are trying

969
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:39,509
to look at those questions of you know

970
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,670
is it one of the things that I think is

971
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:45,930
most fascinating about that is actually

972
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:47,460
the information about the evolutionary

973
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:49,019
history of those species within their

974
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,929
native range and are there places on

975
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:53,699
earth just bio geographically that kind

976
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:55,919
of like breed and basis just because

977
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:59,579
they're like you know more competition

978
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,809
longer evolutionary history more enemies

979
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:02,549
that you could potentially be released

980
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:05,489
from those kind of things you know there

981
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,930
are a couple of studies of that for you

982
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:08,549
know like East Asian species being

983
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:10,559
introduced to the Northeast is one

984
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,320
example and African grasses that are

985
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,239
fire-prone being introduced to a variety

986
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,400
of continents and perpetuating price

987
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,108
cycles there is another example of that

988
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:34,500
so it's a really neat question but I I

989
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:37,619
don't know anything which are based on

990
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:42,809
observational data you're commenting

991
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:46,700
sort of on the organisms that had a

992
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:51,630
smaller range but doesn't this apply

993
00:43:46,699 --> 00:44:03,480
everything that begins observational do

994
00:43:51,630 --> 00:44:06,269
dress just a smaller range alike so the

995
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,869
assumption of people living this one we

996
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,869
have to make

997
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:16,349
[Music]

998
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:28,980
so Lance or not people over to begin

999
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:30,750
with yeah definitely well but then I

1000
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,730
think that what what these studies have

1001
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,530
shown to me is that if you're a

1002
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,329
widespread plant that's not the case

1003
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,130
like the widespread plants actually it

1004
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:40,110
is probably a pretty good assumption to

1005
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,930
say like this is that it's close to

1006
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,820
equilibrium so it's great for me it's

1007
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:46,649
like this narrow range versus wide range

1008
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,240
kind of thing that I would be most I

1009
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,809
would be more skeptical of narrow range

1010
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,909
models and I guess the the intriguing

1011
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:55,529
part for me just bio geographically is

1012
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:56,759
to try to figure out like more things

1013
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,680
like that you know like are there

1014
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,930
particular cases when we should trust

1015
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:03,359
the models more or trust the models less

1016
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:05,609
because that will certainly lead us to

1017
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:17,539
better monitoring and better management

1018
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:24,420
later on you think about fair right

1019
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:32,730
there there applause so so you know it

1020
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:34,590
seems like there's yeah I mean really do

1021
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:39,360
spatial models on bears use very

1022
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:42,809
different methods than plans but part of

1023
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,030
that is also because you have you also

1024
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:48,630
have absence data and you can do you

1025
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:57,840
know like you know things you know

1026
00:45:48,630 --> 00:46:00,360
multiple times through and that's why

1027
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,130
we've been trying to go after abundance

1028
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,050
information more and more because at

1029
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,519
least doesn't necessarily give us

1030
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,430
absence data but at least it gives us

1031
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,289
more insight into like here's actually

1032
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:20,639
invasive versus there it's just like

1033
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:26,779
there is a plant one fun question see

1034
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:29,759
and ideas being a

1035
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:36,870
or is a question for five dated question

1036
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:40,380
whether it is data he where a fetus or

1037
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:43,109
what it is them key strategies to

1038
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,710
implement to help better answer these

1039
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,460
questions

1040
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,929
so maybe abundance yeah we so that's

1041
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,929
that's great that you're asking a

1042
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:53,849
question we actually been trying to to

1043
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:56,129
put together some like recommendations

1044
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:58,110
for the collection of invasive plant

1045
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,480
abundance so there's fantastic work

1046
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:02,039
going on through like IMAP invasives in

1047
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,409
the state of New York through a lot of

1048
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:07,110
the different state level organizations

1049
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:09,239
but those tend to be just occurrences

1050
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,190
and so we don't have absences we don't

1051
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,709
have any sense of how bad the

1052
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,780
infestation is or the areal extent of

1053
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:18,210
the infestation so the two main things

1054
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,100
that I would love to have for plants are

1055
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,380
an estimate of percent cover and an

1056
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:25,139
estimate of the area of infestation and

1057
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,849
those could be completely like just you

1058
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:28,650
know I don't know twenty percent cover

1059
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:30,480
there's a fair bit of it here kind of

1060
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,610
thing and about the size of this room

1061
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,590
that would be totally fine for a lot of

1062
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,789
the modeling stuff that we're trying to

1063
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:41,100
do but we have also been looking through

1064
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:43,019
there is a citizen science and

1065
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,969
management database called ed maps and

1066
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:46,920
we've been looking through that larger

1067
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:48,539
database to try to see what people are

1068
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,690
doing when they're reporting abundance

1069
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:53,849
and those tend to be kind of ranges four

1070
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,309
percent covered or so like less than one

1071
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:59,069
percent went to five five to something

1072
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,779
ten twenty twenty-five pickier and

1073
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:03,980
pickier number there are greater than

1074
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,780
that and those also work really well

1075
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,059
when when we can't because because we

1076
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,310
can't ask you know most managers to go

1077
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:13,049
out and start running like six transects

1078
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:14,789
you know across the landscape but you

1079
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,080
know a thousand points but they're going

1080
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:18,840
to be at a thousand points they could

1081
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,579
probably say you know that's about 5%

1082
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,350
cover or something in these areas and

1083
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:26,690
that information gives us a lot a lot of

1084
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,690
power - thanks for asking
