1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,549
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,549
University

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,169
I pleased to introduce today's speaker

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,820
step on mentally learn before I go

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,679
through the formal introduction though I

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,429
wanted to introduce some work that he

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,980
did in my lab earlier on so Stefan

8
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,419
actually came to Cornell to work in the

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,879
tank Scilab where he stayed for a couple

10
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:28,589
of years and then he came to my life to

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,738
work on the project I'm about to

12
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,739
describe

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,920
to explain what he did I have to explain

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,699
how I got tenure because this slide

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,740
explains what I did during my assistant

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
professorship

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,679
because he came to my lab right after

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,019
that

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,119
so we were what we were interested in

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,550
this question of cytoplasmic meals early

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,899
and gently encoded fertility restoration

22
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,109
this is one of the reproductive

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,109
isolation methods of plants used at the

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,198
time I was assistant professor we didn't

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,228
actually know quite cytoplasmic genome

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,118
was encoding this trait of cytoplasmic

27
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,798
male sterility but it was chloroplasts

28
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,019
and mitochondria we didn't know what

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,670
gene was doing this and we also didn't

30
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,858
know anything about this nuclear

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,469
included fertility restoration gene that

32
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:23,188
could restore the pollen development to

33
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:26,218
this plan so what my lab did was look in

34
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:28,858
petunia to try to find the gene was

35
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:31,038
encoding cytoplasmic male sterility so

36
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:35,239
if you have a

37
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:38,819
fertile line with the

38
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:41,278
recessive allele of the RFG it's 40 if

39
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,278
you have a recessive allele in with the

40
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:46,289
CMS cytoplasm it's sterile you see the

41
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:48,840
lack of Poland about another one and

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,570
then if you have one copy of the

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,810
fertility story you get a normal fertile

44
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,658
plan

45
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,180
so what we found was that there is a

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,859
toxic protein encoded by an abnormal

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,250
gene in my condom and a day and that

48
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,859
sterile plan and the RF allele prevent

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,449
expression of this toxic protein so

50
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,780
that's what we knew and that's how I got

51
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,359
tenure was that finding but then when

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,090
when I came here and Stefan enjoying the

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,030
lab we wanted to find out with the RF

54
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,170
genius at that time we didn't know what

55
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,500
RF genes were so what Stefan did was an

56
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,298
amazing effort to try to identify that

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,209
RF teen and Petunia which is our normal

58
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,830
system at the time there was no genome

59
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,319
for petunia there was no high-throughput

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,209
sequencing there are almost no genetic

61
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,518
resources to step on it and develop

62
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,370
those all from scratch including a a

63
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,459
buyback library all the markers and

64
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,239
after a a an effort that took three

65
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,129
success of two-year USDA grants he was

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,700
able to figure out what the RF gene

67
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,310
encoded he found that it coded in tow

68
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,399
truck of peptide repeat protein this was

69
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,709
the founding member of these

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,230
this protein family for these restores

71
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,500
and it's now known that most restore

72
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,509
genes implants are

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,939
PPR so-called PBR protease you hearing

74
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:18,000
more about them in sedation because in

75
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,310
organelles it's a small world but it's

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,079
it's now known these puppies are now not

77
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,120
to be a large family of RNA binding

78
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,819
proteins that controller can help gene

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,250
expression and this protein turns off

80
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,299
the expression of that toxic gene and

81
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,299
that toxic protein

82
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,859
so Stefan then moved from working on

83
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:41,929
this

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,130
petunia RF projects to working on RNA

85
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,640
editing and that's what he's going to

86
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,650
describe today step on Goffe his

87
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,479
bachelor's degree in biochemistry at the

88
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,370
University of Science and Technology in

89
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:57,829
Montpelier plants and an MS degree and

90
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,289
agronomic science at the inn Romney

91
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,810
swollen too loose and then a PhD in

92
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:06,229
molecular genetics at University cloud

93
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,930
Bernard lyon in France as I eventually

94
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,639
came to

95
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,590
Tanksley lab first in my lab and he's

96
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,779
recently been promoted to be a research

97
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,829
scientist in the department of molecular

98
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,829
biology and genetics

99
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:24,159
thanks for in for this very nice

100
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,740
introduction ok now I have my little to

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,770
the shoe can stop so I'm going to tell

102
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,480
you today about the unraveling the

103
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:36,829
complexity of plant RNA editing

104
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,600
machinery and in the first slide I just

105
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:40,819
an overview of my talk with a little

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,879
background about what plant RNA editing

107
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:46,040
is and then are we identify some of the

108
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,069
components of this plant elitism which

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,500
is the molecular machinery responsible

110
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,750
for this modification and we use the

111
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,610
three different approach genetics

112
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,339
biochemistry approach and then what I

113
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:02,000
call a moto G and I will illustrate what

114
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:03,799
I mean by that in during the talk and in

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
the last part of my talk i'll tell you

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,030
about new editing factors which have not

117
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,310
been published yet and the future

118
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:13,309
direction I want to take my research on

119
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,310
so

120
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:23,809
it's blocked oh

121
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,538
so because I'm not using the right one

122
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:28,610
ok

123
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:31,158
so our editing is a common type of RNA

124
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,919
processing and it occurs in many many

125
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:36,759
species and under very different

126
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:40,068
mechanism so it happens in various

127
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,778
trypanosome squid plant which is going

128
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:48,110
to be the topic of my talk today and

129
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:50,749
even as human being in plant the it's a

130
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,120
post-transcriptional modification some

131
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:55,189
transcripts either sit cited in being

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,949
modified to you reading and this is

133
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:03,229
restricted to only the organelle genome

134
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:06,139
so here the arab adopts this is the plan

135
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:10,068
for them you working on and so in the

136
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:13,218
chloroplast about 40 seas are modified

137
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,778
to yuri Dean and in mitochondria in the

138
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:18,079
same phenomenon except is much more

139
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:22,180
frequent over 600 seas are modified to

140
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:26,149
origin in the mitochondrial genome and

141
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,759
the reaction that that is responsible

142
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:32,509
for this is a germination where the

143
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,120
amino acid here is in a city cited in is

144
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:38,149
replaced by a keto group and thus the

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,189
saturnine is modified to you reading so

146
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:43,728
very often people are wondering why

147
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:45,499
plants edit and so in implants in the

148
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:47,899
plant world this is a corrective

149
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:50,600
mechanism that allows the plant or the

150
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,930
functional protein

151
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,570
because the the

152
00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:01,060
the amino acid after editing is actually

153
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:03,920
encode a more concept amino acid and

154
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,280
also you can create start or stop codon

155
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,830
and ear I give you an example of plastic

156
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,079
transcript and the HD where the start

157
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:15,409
codon in the ACG so it's not a start

158
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,810
column but upon editing vc is modified

159
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,420
to urine in and thus start codon is

160
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,149
creating and that allows the of course

161
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,040
the protein to be translated so this is

162
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,409
an important mechanism for plants

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,540
development because no editing most

164
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,060
article on most article on no protein

165
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,540
and so the loss of editing really

166
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,670
results in many different and various

167
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,750
phenotype depending on where it occurs

168
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:46,000
so here in this example I this is an

169
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:49,670
editing newtons which is unable to edit

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,009
a specific see on the transcript that

171
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,319
encodes the plastid RNA polymerase and

172
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:57,560
as a result this mutant can see is very

173
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,189
sent and as is not autotroph and has to

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,100
be run on a sucrose medium but in our

175
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,290
favorite Newton's in the lab so this

176
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,320
this mutant plants is unable to dt the

177
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,939
specific see on a sec d plastic

178
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,370
transcript and you can see that there is

179
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:15,439
no obvious phenotype associated with is

180
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,199
defect in editing compared to the

181
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,629
wild-type and

182
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,759
here I give another example and this is

183
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:26,540
a mitochondrial

184
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:29,209
mutant in editing so these little plant

185
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,149
is unable to lead to seize on transcript

186
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:34,850
that encode a small ribosomal protein

187
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:37,250
and as a result the translational defect

188
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:41,500
and so these branches are obviously a

189
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:44,000
slow growth phenotype and then when the

190
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,399
defect in editing occurs in very

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,919
important position in the essential gene

192
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,639
it's an embryo if of the plant is not

193
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,649
able to make it

194
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,809
so i told you in the introduction that

195
00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:00,079
not all the seeds are edited to you read

196
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:03,500
in the specificity only for TCS IDT

197
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,480
dinner in a plastic and around 600 so

198
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,289
definitely not all the fees i heated and

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,779
so this the specificity is really

200
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:14,469
dependent upon two elements first

201
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,519
there's this element which is a small

202
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,590
ribonucleotide sequence which is a

203
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,439
upstream of the seeds to be edited and

204
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,629
so in this video figure i showed that

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,690
theses don't add this assignment so they

206
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:29,059
won't be edited this he possess this

207
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,060
assignment and so you will be modified

208
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,639
to origin but that's only a part of the

209
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,829
equation the other obviously is trans

210
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:40,000
factor that's gonna recognize this

211
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,830
element binds to the CC element and then

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,450
process the sea and modify it were you

213
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:50,600
reading and so in this complicated slide

214
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,480
that was done some time ago but by a

215
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,129
postdoc in the lab Charles

216
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,230
the this side showed that this trans

217
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,509
factor that we call plant editor is

218
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,190
actually a small

219
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:05,750
protein complex so what Charles did he

220
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,850
extracts protein from chloroplast and

221
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,610
then sighs fractionated them on the size

222
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,070
exclusion chromatography and so this is

223
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,320
all the fraction from the the big one

224
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,200
for the small one and then he sa each

225
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,910
fraction for editing activity and so I

226
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,519
don't want to go into deterrent to the

227
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:24,980
essay just for you to understand is that

228
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,778
these bands the morning turns his band

229
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,690
and the more active for eating is the

230
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:33,289
fraction and so this van the number 13

231
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,269
is the is the most is where the band is

232
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:38,389
most intense here is the just

233
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:41,028
quantification of this band and this

234
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:43,070
band is again is a comprised between 200

235
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:46,028
and 400 kilo dalton thus demonstrating

236
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,399
that its plant elitism is a small

237
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:52,100
protein complex and so the game in the

238
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,139
lad was trying to find the components of

239
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,750
this plant elitism and because I'm a

240
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,959
geneticist at that time I was working on

241
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,039
on CNS but I also developed this as a

242
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:05,739
side project and these are a different

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,588
ization of

244
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,629
arabidopsis shot from above and the the

245
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,690
point of this slide is just to show you

246
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:17,028
our diverse these plants are in the size

247
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,370
and morphology of there was that leaves

248
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:22,549
and so looking at this pan I thought

249
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:25,399
that maybe also they were differing in

250
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:27,769
the way they edit their seeds and

251
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,190
actually that was a good guess otherwise

252
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:33,318
I won't talk about it and so with the

253
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,230
previous that was years ago 10 over 10

254
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:39,969
years ago with a postdoc in the lab and

255
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,829
launched a teeny we study this

256
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,870
particular

257
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:48,500
transcript ECB 206 which is called also

258
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,909
CC NB and we we were interested we focus

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,578
on this transcript because it's the

260
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:55,610
transcript that possess the highest

261
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:58,068
number of a DDT that's about 40 seas

262
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,759
that are edited so in one experiment we

263
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:04,519
could potentially look for difference

264
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:07,068
between these two widely used as asian

265
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,459
runs very and columbia at 40 position

266
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:11,958
along the transcript and

267
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:13,879
here is an electropherogram and you can

268
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,109
see that this position the columbia is

269
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,838
more edgy than the director because the

270
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,560
T peak is higher in Columbia that it is

271
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,839
in the in Landsberg director and once

272
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,419
once you have a difference in parent

273
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,300
I'll ization that's almost the end of

274
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:32,610
the story not really but in arabidopsis

275
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,649
because then you can use many genetic

276
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,589
resources other people have crossed

277
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:40,198
these two these two guy and so you can

278
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,910
use the progeny to study the segregation

279
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,789
of this differential extent in the

280
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:47,389
progeny and that's what we did several

281
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:50,639
times and a I just show you an example

282
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:52,259
so we found that one of the gene

283
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,230
controlling these differential editing

284
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,778
extent was actually in in this area

285
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,860
which is on chromosome 2 and with a wall

286
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:05,278
tonight was an undergrad doing silly

287
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,750
faces sorry with me what Walter did a

288
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,009
screen many many hundreds of progeny

289
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,620
coming from the cross between landsberg

290
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:15,269
and Columbia and these are this progeny

291
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,220
this plant and they are recombinant

292
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,470
because they have inherited part of the

293
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,810
genome from i'm going to try sell to

294
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,959
shake from lands bearing in blue and

295
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:27,838
part from columbia in red and and then

296
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,698
what Walter dds a the editing extent of

297
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,250
all these progeny is for coming in

298
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:34,948
plants and so again if they were edited

299
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,828
like Columbia River red like a red tie

300
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,599
blue and then it's a regression of the

301
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:41,879
phenotype on a genotype you just have to

302
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,110
look at matching colors and the matching

303
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,259
colors are just between these two

304
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:50,129
recombination point and there there was

305
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:52,639
only one gene that we call rm14 required

306
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,289
for efficiency of mitochondrial editing

307
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,089
so we were pretty convinced because

308
00:13:55,289 --> 00:14:00,389
there was only one gene that was the the

309
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:03,180
gene and this gene again is a PPR as

310
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:06,028
maureen told you in the introduction the

311
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:09,299
restoration of fertility is also a PPR

312
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:11,159
PPR because went a tripeptide repeat

313
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,359
that's the only time i'm going to tell

314
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:18,649
it it's composed by a repeat which are

315
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,720
35 I mean long and in addition this

316
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,539
protein content some extra motif at the

317
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,840
c-terminus and

318
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:30,149
so in order to demonstrate that these

319
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,100
this gene was really disappointing was

320
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,829
an editing factor we looked at the

321
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,528
mutant DNA insertional mutant and we

322
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,200
found one and then we compared the level

323
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:42,870
of editing instant in the homozygous

324
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,610
newtons which add this T DNA which

325
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,370
disrupt the expression of this gene and

326
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,980
the almost arias wild-type and yes there

327
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,210
was a significant difference in the

328
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,339
level of imaging stand for this

329
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,009
particular side thus demonstrating that

330
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:59,310
rm1 was really the editing factor

331
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:01,169
recognizing this mitochondrial site so

332
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:05,189
that illustrate the genetic approach

333
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:06,838
which was pretty cumbersome so here the

334
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,920
so we're going to build up the model as

335
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,650
a puzzle so this PPR protein and a lot

336
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,449
have time to show you the evidence but

337
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,819
the other one that are the recognition

338
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,220
factor they recognize the season event

339
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,930
and bind to it and they are found both

340
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,600
in the crop last and in the

341
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:28,289
mitochondrial editors oh but there are

342
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,970
other other component because I told you

343
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:32,549
at the very beginning but that we knew

344
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,550
that the this elite ozone is about 200

345
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:38,338
and 400 kilo dalton and the size of the

346
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:41,309
PPR is way below that so we knew that

347
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:44,370
there were other components and so the

348
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:46,229
way we decided to chase this component

349
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,360
and that's a work that I did in

350
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,810
collaboration with Wade error who used

351
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,009
to be a vc MV student in in the lab so

352
00:15:51,809 --> 00:16:00,299
what way did he put a

353
00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:02,399
flag on on one of the our favorite PPR

354
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,889
factor called rare one and then using

355
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,399
antibody

356
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:10,500
against this rare one it was able to

357
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,990
immunoprecipitated the all complex and

358
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,490
then with the collaboration with the Van

359
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,320
Wyck club where we were able to identify

360
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,529
one of the components of these complex

361
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,930
as being required for RNA editing factor

362
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,470
interacting protein 1 and so because

363
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:29,669
this reponn was member of these complex

364
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,129
obviously we wanted to know whether it

365
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:36,689
was also an editing factor and so as

366
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:40,379
usual we looked at gdna mutant and we

367
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,620
found two while which was in in the in

368
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,950
the central and as I told you before

369
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,690
obviously these protein this gene is

370
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,390
essential gene because we were unable to

371
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,650
recover homozygous mutant for this new

372
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:57,929
talent but luckily for us we are also a

373
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,850
cdna inserted in the promoter and we

374
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:01,739
were able to recover almost i goes

375
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,589
newtons and you can see that this plant

376
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:09,779
is very effective in its development and

377
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:12,329
then by using bulk sequencing we were we

378
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:15,059
analyze all the ad term meaning all

379
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,859
these the ADT's in the chloroplast of

380
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:20,789
the plastid and in the mitochondria and

381
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:22,949
what we found was that this mutant was

382
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,109
effective in about a third of this

383
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,330
plastinated inside meaning that the

384
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,189
level of editing in the mutant for this

385
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:31,919
site was much reduced compared to the

386
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,570
wild-type but more importantly about

387
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,100
three quarter of the site in the

388
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:39,529
mitochondria were effective and about

389
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:41,599
100 was really the the level of editing

390
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:44,990
was not even the detectable by Bach

391
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:47,599
sequencing it was gone and that was a

392
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,700
very exciting result because it was the

393
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,469
first time that

394
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,470
member I mean a component of the plan

395
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,559
todito Sam was not a PPR protein rip one

396
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,440
is not a PPR protein

397
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,750
so then we wanted to know because the

398
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,740
PPR I told you bind recognize and bind

399
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,240
the RNA so we were wondering how the

400
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,640
specificity work for a point what its

401
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,579
targets because it doesn't affect all

402
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,610
the all the Seas many fees but not all

403
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:20,240
of them and that was a work that was

404
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:23,899
done by tau tau son was a produced plant

405
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,349
bio grad student working in lab and what

406
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:30,530
style showed by using East library that

407
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:32,449
actually the recognition of our free

408
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,970
porn for its target was mediated through

409
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,789
its interaction with a recognition

410
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,650
factor and so in order to make you

411
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:42,920
understand what I just said I have this

412
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,790
little animation we're here you can see

413
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,250
that in the power blast kyosho Darrell

414
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,529
one interact with rip one sorry rip

415
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,690
interact with the rare one it also

416
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:56,750
interact with another recognition factor

417
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,850
called CR 28 I'm not responsible for his

418
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,109
name and then but then rip one doesn't

419
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:05,449
interact with here 21 and so when the

420
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:08,149
new in the mutant rip one is not there

421
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:12,980
anymore or is very reduced and then only

422
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:15,470
the site that for which reprod interacts

423
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,990
with the recognition factor are affected

424
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,039
in the mutant the sides for which rip

425
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,799
one doesn't interact with the

426
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,720
recognition factor does don't see there

427
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,419
editing little effective in the mutants

428
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,009
and what's true in the chloroplast is

429
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,930
true also in the plastid and

430
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:36,740
tell showed also that rip one was able

431
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:39,950
to a modular eyes by Easter hybrid okay

432
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,839
so that's all this story that the second

433
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,779
part was to illustrate the biochemist

434
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:49,149
call approach in order to identify

435
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:51,109
components of the plants elitism and and

436
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,509
now I'm going to tell you about the

437
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:56,029
amala G and what I meant by that is that

438
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:58,700
rip one is a member of a small tiny of

439
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,779
protein in the arabidopsis there are

440
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:06,590
nine members

441
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:09,470
this is good so r upon which we found

442
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:12,230
was a involved in mitochondria and plus

443
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,860
TD editing and there's all these factors

444
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,110
and I identify them by using

445
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:22,429
software and this broke we call in the

446
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:24,139
rib motif it just amuro G block we don't

447
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,220
know really what the function obviously

448
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,940
they are important because they are

449
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,740
conserved in the rib family and then of

450
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,320
course we were wondering are any of

451
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,779
these other protein also editing factors

452
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:40,419
and so and this time instead of using

453
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:43,460
bulk sequencing I develop a

454
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,620
method based on a next-generation

455
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,809
sequencing to analyze Newton's or

456
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:51,279
silence tissue from this from this other

457
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:56,240
gene and so briefly it's very easy

458
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:59,389
method where I use a specific primer for

459
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,210
all the organelle jeans so is is the

460
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,159
real RNA and some RNA are edited more

461
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:08,460
than other and then I do rt-pcr and then

462
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,169
this thing are you know cdna whether you

463
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,169
eat transforming tea and then I share

464
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:16,139
the cna and use these shield fragments

465
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:20,909
to build up alumina library and then I

466
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:23,939
just align align these rates on the

467
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:27,989
genome and then I just count really then

468
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:31,259
the number of thread being t or blue

469
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:34,259
being c and the ratio of red rubies need

470
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,348
a very accurate measure of the level of

471
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,479
editing and that

472
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:42,138
collaboration that I did with the robot

473
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:45,749
bukovski was a bioinformatician here

474
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:50,248
so I use these methods to analyze the

475
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:53,460
mutant and and silence tissue in this

476
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:55,079
other member and i found that rib to and

477
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,419
replying were preceded in character

478
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,178
while rid three and repay or my token

479
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,999
you're dissing factor

480
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:05,879
but also using these motifs to integrate

481
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:09,329
the database i found that there was this

482
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:11,158
weird protein that we call on 14

483
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:14,069
organelle RNA recognition motif

484
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,080
containing protein 1 and it's a weird

485
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:19,229
one because

486
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:20,908
it has a duplicated REEP REEP domain

487
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:23,759
which is also truncated you can see

488
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:28,139
there's some other blogs are missing and

489
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,868
in addition it has a motif and c

490
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:33,868
terminus which is called RN for RNA

491
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:35,668
recognition motif and so we were of

492
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:38,189
course interested to know whether this

493
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:40,249
on one also was an Indian factor and so

494
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,439
as usual we

495
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:45,419
looked at the GDN a mutant in the first

496
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:48,298
exam and so you can see that this plant

497
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,909
is really morphologically okay but when

498
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:52,739
we surveyed the editor we found that the

499
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:54,869
mitochondrial item was not affected but

500
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:57,179
the placidity term was effective in each

501
00:22:54,868 --> 00:23:00,208
mutant and about two-third of the

502
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,099
editing site where they were reduced in

503
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:05,749
the newton with 12 side which had a

504
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:08,848
major loss of editing and

505
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:10,348
again we were interested so I told you I

506
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:12,168
don't know if you remember that this

507
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:15,538
protein here as

508
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:19,259
22 part rip rip that's how we identified

509
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:21,778
it and the RM and we were curious to

510
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:24,239
know which which part is important for

511
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:26,278
the editing ability of this protein and

512
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:29,278
again that's a work that was done by a

513
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:31,138
towel so here I show the 12 side that

514
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:33,628
are severely reducing the editing

515
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:36,028
instant in a mutant so the bar the blue

516
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:39,269
bar is the level editing in a white hat

517
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:43,788
but very high and in the mutant very low

518
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:45,929
and so what's tau did was to present he

519
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:49,919
transformed protoplast for the mutant

520
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:52,309
first with the reprint and when he did

521
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,469
that nothing really happened and when we

522
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:58,739
did the same experiment with the RM it

523
00:23:55,469 --> 00:24:02,338
was able to complement most of the site

524
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:05,278
at least partially and so that was the

525
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:07,348
and to our surprise actually because we

526
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,878
were expecting more than repaid to be

527
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:12,058
involved in anything because that's how

528
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:13,978
we identify this protein but actually to

529
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:16,648
our surprise it's the are and parts of

530
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:20,640
this protein that was responsible for

531
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:20,639
the editing each of these protein

532
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:27,599
so and then as for rip 1 tau using East

533
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:31,899
why breed

534
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:34,539
studied all these on one was recognizing

535
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,570
is target and it's the same story as 401

536
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:40,799
the the recognition is mediated through

537
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:44,139
its interaction with the with non

538
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,599
recognition factor which are PPR and so

539
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:51,340
again in the in the in the mutant when

540
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:53,980
on one goes down only the site for which

541
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:55,839
on one interacts with the PPR see there

542
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,269
editing extent to go down in the mutant

543
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,730
not this one because again on one

544
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:03,069
doesn't interact with real one and also

545
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,279
tell showed that on one was interacting

546
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,869
with other non

547
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,899
editing factor from the rib family reap

548
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:12,359
102

549
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,000
so now we are

550
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:18,909
we just add other parts in the puzzle

551
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,569
the reap members the aam one for the

552
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,000
chloroplast and if I put on one touching

553
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:27,369
the RNA in this model it's because by

554
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,429
with collaboration with the back lab

555
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:33,609
I've shown that this on one has some

556
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:37,419
specificity for the RNA target and this

557
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:39,879
is a GF gel shift assay and you can see

558
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:43,830
this is one of the one of the target of

559
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:47,140
m1 and thus nice ships compared to a

560
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:50,168
non-target and this now we have a new

561
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,860
student at Andrew in the lab was going

562
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:56,169
to study more deeply these the

563
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,469
recognition and the binding of on one

564
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:01,929
for its RNA targets

565
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:06,100
okay so this is for the chloroplast what

566
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:07,720
about the Mitel so again the defining of

567
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:12,129
these are M being involved in editing

568
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,319
open a new a new or all area for us to

569
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,049
explore because the iron is very

570
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,839
frequent motif in the protein world and

571
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:24,039
in a bit of ceaseless about 200 protein

572
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,839
that contain this RN and so I'm sorry so

573
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:29,470
we could have you know use brute force

574
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:32,589
and and test least one with proteins

575
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,990
that's much work and so we're trying to

576
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:38,259
be smart and what we did was a video

577
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,569
genetic analysis of the based on the RM

578
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:43,779
motif of all this protein in arabidopsis

579
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:46,230
so this RI motif is about 18 amino acid

580
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,569
and what we

581
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:52,240
observed was on one this new editing

582
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:55,089
factor was part of this specific played

583
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,120
continuing about 20 members and

584
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:59,980
obviously the

585
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,678
question then was are these also

586
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,839
potential editing factors so we got a

587
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,330
grant with maureen that just ended up

588
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,789
for which more in what the main pii was

589
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:12,548
the copy i but lucky for us we just got

590
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:15,908
a new brand for which now I'm the P I am

591
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:17,548
wearing is the copy I and so here now

592
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:21,460
i'm going to show you

593
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:23,700
the work from Shaolin was a grad student

594
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,950
in the lab and

595
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,769
just finished and so she study a this

596
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,450
clade of on protein and so that's

597
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:33,879
another way to represent all these

598
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:37,870
proteins so with the funding father is

599
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,240
on one so it has the reprint RM and all

600
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:43,089
the other protein which belong to

601
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,000
displayed and they do because the RM

602
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:49,808
found in his other arm are very similar

603
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,200
to the RN found in on one and so what

604
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:56,079
challenge shown during a

605
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,990
PhD was that on two three and four when

606
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,000
mitochondrial editing factor and the m6

607
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,339
is a plastid in fact random chicks has

608
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,519
not been published yet and I'll talk

609
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:08,250
about that at the end of my talk and

610
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,700
some of these other

611
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:14,579
member also possess extra domain glycine

612
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,140
rich domain

613
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,949
so here are just going to show you an

614
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:24,049
example of

615
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:25,669
showering work again same story she out

616
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:27,950
to demonstrate that um three was a

617
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:30,799
mitochondria leading factor she looked

618
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,808
at the mutant and she got a mutant in

619
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:36,138
the Texan and then she compared the

620
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:38,690
level of editing in mitochondrial side

621
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:41,209
actually this this all three is involved

622
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,610
in the control of editing of twenty

623
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,720
percent of the mitochondrial side over

624
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:50,898
100 side but er just show only two so

625
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,419
here is the level of editing extent in a

626
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:55,158
white type in grain and in magenta in

627
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:56,809
the mutant and you can see this is a

628
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,940
very significant difference level of

629
00:28:56,808 --> 00:29:01,339
editing sent between the white side in

630
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,000
the mutant and the same is true for this

631
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:08,449
other side then what cha indeed was to

632
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,349
complement the these mutants by putting

633
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:14,929
a functional functional on three under

634
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:17,240
the control of 35s promoter and you can

635
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:19,100
see that she was able to restore the

636
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,440
level of editing and increase it very

637
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:24,079
significantly when compared to the

638
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,080
mutant the leveraging was from around

639
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,879
forty percent for this site to about 85

640
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:32,599
to 90 percent in the transgenic plant

641
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,389
and then we were wondering I told you

642
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:38,558
that the four on one what was important

643
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:41,269
was the RM motif and

644
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:45,019
another repeat and i'm free as to motive

645
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:48,019
as the RM and the glycine reach motif or

646
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:49,788
domain sorry and and then we of course

647
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,589
were wondering whether it was the same

648
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,798
story as four on one whether it was the

649
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:56,959
RM domain or the glycine which domain

650
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,720
that was important for the editing

651
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,169
ability of this protein and so what

652
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,259
shall indeed was to again so here's a

653
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:08,840
mutant for a specific site and its low

654
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:12,619
edited about fifteen percent when she

655
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:16,490
when china the all flanks on three she's

656
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:18,678
able to restore the editing level two

657
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,460
forty five percent and when she used

658
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,919
only the RM again she's able to

659
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,169
significantly increase increase the

660
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,749
level of editing extent thus again

661
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:30,580
demonstrating that what's important for

662
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:34,440
the editing ability of this protein is

663
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:37,329
the RM motifs

664
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,538
okay and then as usual she was

665
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:42,668
interested to know whether these these

666
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:44,349
new editing factors was part of the

667
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:47,710
editors amande was interacting with

668
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:51,398
other non editing factor and here I just

669
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:53,558
show you an example see she used by a c4

670
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:57,699
bimolecular fluorescence complementation

671
00:30:53,558 --> 00:31:00,849
and so she put half of your pure four on

672
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,749
each part of the protein that she wants

673
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:06,939
to study the interaction on three and in

674
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:09,038
this case rip one and if they interact

675
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,179
then he will bring the two part close

676
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:14,048
enough so that they are able to

677
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:15,899
fluoresce and so then she did that in

678
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:19,118
eco sheeana and

679
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:22,868
this is a negative control so these are

680
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:24,579
in red of the auto pure sent from the

681
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:27,878
chloroplast from the chlorophyll and

682
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:30,638
here is a close-up you can see that this

683
00:31:27,878 --> 00:31:32,558
nice sports fluorescence when she did

684
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:36,808
this experiment demonstrating that all

685
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:40,470
three and rip one can interact in planta

686
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:43,509
so now now what's true for

687
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:45,909
for chloroplast is true also for

688
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:50,009
mitochondria so you have PPR you are

689
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:54,730
bleep and you are also on okay

690
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:58,240
and then we steal an interrogation mark

691
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:01,929
here as you can see and so we now also

692
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,079
worked on again by towel he did like use

693
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:07,350
the same strategy as why did but he put

694
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:11,470
a flag on the on one and

695
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:13,118
immunoprecipitated eat and then again

696
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,019
with the collaboration with the

697
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:18,019
transferrin week

698
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:21,349
and we determined by mass spectrometry

699
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:25,009
that one of these protein that was

700
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:28,299
pulled down with on one was 0 z 1 z 1

701
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:32,109
for organization or one because this

702
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:35,379
protein contains zinc finger motif and

703
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:38,629
because Ozzy one was

704
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:40,160
immunoprecipitated with on one again we

705
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,070
were wondering whether Ozzy one was a

706
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:46,160
leading factor and as usual we looked at

707
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:48,740
the DNA insertional mutant and this time

708
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,190
unlike on one these mutant is not very

709
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,799
happy that's the mutant here so it's an

710
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,230
albino it's small and it has to be one

711
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,079
on sucrose medium and when we looked at

712
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:02,000
the editor of this mutant what we found

713
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,069
is that the majority of the plastid

714
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,890
editing side were affected in this

715
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:11,179
mutant and because this Aussie one was

716
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,580
identified for its interaction with on

717
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,680
one we were wondering whether there was

718
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:17,480
overlap in the site under the control of

719
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,039
these two editing factor and yes

720
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,990
actually the majority of the site 21 are

721
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:28,509
cedar editing incense severely affected

722
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:33,319
in both m1 and the Aussie one mutant

723
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:35,599
so Ozzy one belongs to a small family of

724
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:37,429
protein there's four members and again

725
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,279
this is a little diagram of how they

726
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:43,880
look like with the homology block and

727
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:45,649
the only really non motif is as I told

728
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,130
before he's a sinking a motive in this

729
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:51,410
light blue turquoise Ozzy one possessed

730
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:56,390
two of the zinc finger motif oh sorry oh

731
00:33:51,410 --> 00:34:00,380
g1 or g2 as 20 z three 3 &amp; 0 0 4 and

732
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:02,420
then of course the obvious question to

733
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,780
ask because he worked for it works for

734
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,529
all of these other members also editing

735
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:10,500
factors

736
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:13,679
so now I hope I convince you that the

737
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:17,360
planted is awesome our complex protein

738
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,730
small but complex which contain several

739
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,409
protein so

740
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,449
and that also they contain the same

741
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,880
protein in both the mitochondria ID

742
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:28,559
tourism and the progress PPR which had

743
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,000
the recognition factor that bind to the

744
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:36,000
target rip on an Aussie Aussie has been

745
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,230
just demonstrated in Pro procedures are

746
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,230
not yet in the mitochondria

747
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,400
okay so now in the last part of my talk

748
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:49,070
I'm going to tell you about a new

749
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:54,079
plastic editing factor on six

750
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:56,580
OOP yes anaam 6 actually as the

751
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,259
from the start we had a strong

752
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,650
presumption that this was also an easy

753
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,530
teen factor because the RM found in this

754
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:08,250
protein is the most similar to UM one so

755
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,240
again what we did was to study

756
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:14,489
editing mutant sorry mutant t-dna

757
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:17,209
international mutant and when we use SDS

758
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:20,250
pcr sec this next generation

759
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,369
based approach to study the editor of

760
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,929
these mutants we found that there was no

761
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:27,420
mitochondrial editing defect but there

762
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:30,210
was plastic editing effect so again here

763
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,760
in green is a level of editing extent in

764
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,960
the white type in magenta in were in

765
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,240
mutant for this particular protein on

766
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,710
six and you can see that this strong

767
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,989
reduction of anything in stand for this

768
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:46,260
side accd from one hundred percent goes

769
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:50,779
to thirty percent even more pronounced

770
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,070
for this I'd PSB f77 for which the

771
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,860
editing goes from one hundred percent to

772
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:59,880
five percent and just to show you that

773
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,710
it's not affecting this this other side

774
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,050
for which the same level of editing

775
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,940
instant in the white type and in the

776
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,970
mutant and it is another way to

777
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,280
represent the reduction it's the the the

778
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:13,349
the difference reported to the value of

779
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,780
the other white type so you can see that

780
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:19,759
the the side that explain the most

781
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:23,519
drastic reduction is this site on PS DF

782
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,770
so as we were as n decide this these

783
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,360
mutants are

784
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:29,579
shorter growth phenotype and also

785
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,340
detecting the photosynthetic efficiency

786
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,710
and so as we were working on this

787
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,990
Newton's actually we found out that

788
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,559
another

789
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:43,679
group was working on this mutant yan liu

790
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:47,070
and but she's a photosynthetic person so

791
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,529
she did not use the same screen to to

792
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,230
identify this Newton and that's that's a

793
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:54,570
word basically this wet floors and it

794
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:57,260
shows that the this mutant is affected

795
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:01,110
in this a photosynthetic efficiency

796
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,080
again shalin showed that objects was

797
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:06,280
part of these plastics and elitism by

798
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,159
studying its interaction with non in

799
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,780
fact I was by FC and ear I just show a

800
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:15,609
few example of arm sixth

801
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:20,880
interacting with rip one here and there

802
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:24,070
are with the OC one year and there and

803
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,490
so I told you that mostly there's two

804
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:31,690
sides which are affected in the mutant a

805
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:33,729
CCD and PS BF and eighth and so and this

806
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,280
phenotype too and so the question was

807
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,780
which which side is responsible for the

808
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,920
phenotype and we had strong presumption

809
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,480
that it was the PS BF defect in editing

810
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,490
because we add a mutant in the lab which

811
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,050
is affecting in the acc d and i show you

812
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:49,509
a picture at the very beginning of the

813
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,730
talk and there's no phenotype associated

814
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,250
with these mutants so in order to

815
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,800
demonstrate that the PhDs deflecting

816
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,889
editing was responsible for the for this

817
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,720
phenotype small growth and

818
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:03,789
photosynthetic

819
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:08,709
deficiency what he indeed was a pretty

820
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:11,650
cool experiment she took PS BF and with

821
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:15,309
the g genomically encoded and she

822
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:18,010
transformed a plant mutant and so you

823
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:19,690
can see here it's translated and here in

824
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,880
green is the transit peptide that allows

825
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:25,000
the protein to goes in a chloroplast and

826
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,119
again this red meaning that the this

827
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,550
protein is already edited

828
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,619
and then by doing that she was able to

829
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,470
at least partially complements the

830
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:37,179
defect the morphological defect where

831
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:39,730
you can see you have to trust me but the

832
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:42,519
even though these transgenic plants are

833
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,769
not at the level of the white side they

834
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:46,780
are much better and much bigger than the

835
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:49,059
than the mutant and also the

836
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,670
photosynthetic efficiency even though is

837
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:54,429
not at the level of the wild-type is

838
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,409
much better than Newton's and so in

839
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:57,779
other words that demonstrating that the

840
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,809
defect

841
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,850
of picea PS BF editing is a one

842
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:05,250
responsible for the the morphology

843
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:06,949
morphological defect we observe in

844
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:11,840
English mutants

845
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:14,609
so in summary I hope that today I

846
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,650
convince you that the plant it is ozone

847
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:20,099
is complex and contain at least for

848
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:23,630
protein families for the plastid so the

849
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,630
PPR which are the recognition

850
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:31,579
sorry the PPR the ribs which are also

851
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,840
called moss the arms and the O's but

852
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:36,090
only three protein families have been

853
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,910
identified of sofa in the mitochondrial

854
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:44,039
editor zone and they are the same the

855
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:46,319
PPR the more ribs and the arms also the

856
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,809
plant elitism is really diverse in its

857
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,690
composition not only in ppl at the

858
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,639
content because the PPR differ for every

859
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,280
side you got the ugly the recognition

860
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,650
factor but also in regards to these

861
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,530
other components there are other rib and

862
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:05,610
for instance so today I told you about

863
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:08,280
20 m 1 and m 6 which are plastic aging

864
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,860
factor and the side another control of

865
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,840
difference the two sides mostly affected

866
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,410
by the m6 mutants are not affected by

867
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,600
the on one mutant so in other words they

868
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:20,940
are editors am classically to them that

869
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,400
content on one and order that contain

870
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:28,679
object depending on which side the gonna

871
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:31,680
modify and m6 is a unique usual on

872
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,169
protein because it really recognized a

873
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,839
very small number of targets only really

874
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:40,349
two mostly to when other or all the

875
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:43,470
other on the plastid or or mitochondrial

876
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:45,789
really recognize and affect many many

877
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:49,939
sides

878
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:53,009
