joining us here today for the our panel

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,640
presentation that is entitled genomics

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,478
and the future of Agriculture and I'd

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,799
like to start this afternoon by giving

25
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,719
you a little bit of background on the

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,439
Liberty hide Bailey lecture series and

27
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,959
and that is the Liberty hiy Bailey

28
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:24,199
lecture series that we are celebrating

29
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:27,919
this afternoon this is an annual feature

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,680
of our reunion events here in the

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,640
college and this featur

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,040
this event features distinguished

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,840
faculty who are working in key priority

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,000
areas for the college in previous years

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,719
topics have included for example why

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,159
Social Media Matters and we also have

37
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:51,559
taken a look at the debate on the role

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,759
of GMOs in feeding our growing Global

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,000
populations it is my hope today that

40
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,959
this Liberty hiy Bailey lecture will

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,159
both deepen your understanding of

42
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,399
genomics and help you see the future of

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,680
Agriculture and further we hope that

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,679
this lecture today will help demonstrate

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
the impact that the College of

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,039
Agriculture and Life Sciences has had

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,400
and will continue to have as we look

48
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:21,519
toward addressing complex Global issues

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,120
it's particularly fitting that the name

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,439
of this lecture is Liberty Hyde Bailey

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,959
and Liberty Hyde Bailey was the very

52
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:32,280
first dean of the College of agriculture

53
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,000
at Cornell University and I think you're

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,840
all aware that the iconic Bailey Hall

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,158
right across the street here is named

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,080
after our first Dean now Bailey had many

57
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:46,719
roles throughout his lifetime he was a

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,200
botanist a horticulturalist he was a

59
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,560
plant breeder certainly a teacher a very

60
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,878
successful administrator he was a

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,840
lobbyist a very very prolific writer he

62
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,959
was an editor he was a poet he was a

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,598
rural sociologist he was a philosopher

64
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,799
he was a traveler and certainly he was

65
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,079
an

66
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,000
environmentalist it is not in any way an

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,159
understatement to say that he

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,080
single-handedly helped to create the

69
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:21,199
science of horiculture his tireless

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,719
lobbying of the New York State

71
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:28,119
Legislature led to the establishment in

72
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,519
1904 of the New York State College of

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,759
Agriculture right here at Cornell

74
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,959
Bailey was an early Visionary in terms

75
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,639
of seeing agriculture as an academic

76
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,598
discipline and to him the fundamental

77
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,559
purpose of Education was to serve the

78
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,759
people and he believed that the

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,080
resolution of agricultural problems were

80
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,959
every bit as important as resolving

81
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,560
other cultural ethical and legal issues

82
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,799
and hence his bringing agriculture to

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,598
the four as an academic discipline he

84
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,319
led a remarkable life and a remarkable

85
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,878
career and his influence not only here

86
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:11,518
at Cornell University continues to

87
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:14,280
resonate to this day now just like

88
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,798
Liberty Hyde Bailey today's panelists

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,079
are pioneers in their fields not only

90
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:22,879
are they conducting groundbreaking

91
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,560
research they're also helping to fulfill

92
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,680
the College of Agriculture and life

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,560
science's mission of providing knowledge

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,800
with public purpose to the people of the

makuch Greg Martin and Jim giovanoni are

98
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:48,638
not only Pioneers in their field they

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:53,160
are all former alumni of Liberty Hyde

100
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:57,720
Bailey Professor Amer Steve tanksley's

101

105
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,839
would really be appreciated so Steve

106
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:19,038
timson Steve's work in molecular

107
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,959
genetics revolutionized modern plant

108
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,680
breeding by creating the first

109
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,799
chromosomal maps of plants and by

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,639
pioneering genetic techniques that are

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,759
absolutely essential to development of

112
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,759
new crops his research paved the way for

113
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,439
improvements in size nutritional value

114
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,319
and disease resistance of major food

115
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,240
crops his work also helped to lay the

116
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,919
foundation for the Breakthrough

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,240
technology that is known as marker

118
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:50,198
assisted selection which is critically

119
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,478
important tool for plant breeding Steve

120
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,038
did his undergraduate work in Agronomy

121
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,079
at Colorado State University and he

122
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,240
earned his PhD from the University of

123
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:02,359
California Davis where he worked on

124
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,400
rudiment M AR genetic maps for plants he

125
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,919
came to Cornell in

126
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,799
1985 as an associate professor in what

127
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,519
was then the department of plant

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,120
breeding and biometry over the ensuing

129
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,120
decade he and his team developed tools

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,360
that allowed for complete mapping of the

131
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,560
Tomato genome and in

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,199
1997 he spearheaded the Cornell genomics

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,120
initiative which coordinated way more

134
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,240
than 50 faculty members from more than

135
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,160
20 departments across the entire

136
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,038
University to help helped develop

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,639
synergies that were based on the

138
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,038
University strengths in the Life

139
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,519

bioinformatics company that he founded

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,960
in 2006 in addition to all of the other

149
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,120
achievements that I've already mentioned

150
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,839
Steve won the Alexander Von humble

151

157
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,840
was awarded the Japan prize which honors

158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,800
scientists and this is in quotes whose

159
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:35,239
original and outstanding achievements

160
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,639
are not only scientifically impressive

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,800
but have also served to promote peace

162
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,360
and prosperity For All Mankind Steve was

163
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,960
one of two honores that were honored

164
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,800
this year Steve not only had the vision

165
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,158
to transform the whole field of plant

166
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,960
breeding his legacy also includes

167
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,000
mentoring the next generation of

168
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,158
groundbreaking plant scientists here at

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,319
Cornell and build the university into a

170
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:05,560
world leader in genomics and and here's

171
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,439
something that you may not know right

172
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,879
now by us and news and World Report

173
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:14,158
Cornell University is ranked number one

174
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,360
in the world in plant sciences and to a

175
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,839
very large extent that is the legacy of

176
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,000
Steve tanksley and his team so that's an

177
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,038
incredible accomplishment for Cornell

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,319
University and thank you for that so now

179
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,478
building on Steve tanksley's Legacy here

180
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,199
at Cornell I'd now like to introduce

181
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,158
today's panelists and they'll come up

182
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,680
one by one to give their presentations

183
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,799
and then when they're finished with the

184
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,359
presentations uh we'll all be seated

185
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,918
here uh at the front uh but for now I'll

186
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,120
talk a little bit about each panelist

187
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,439
and then I'll invite Susan up to to give

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,039
the first presentation so I'll start

189
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,680
with Susan and Professor Susan makuch is

190
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:54,039
one of the world's foremost experts on

191
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:57,239
rice and rice breeding she received her

192
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:00,159
ba from Smith college her Ms from the

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,000
University of Massachusetts and her PhD

194
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,519
from Cornell in 1990 during which time

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,159
she worked in Steve's lab she spent 5

196
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,320
years with the international rice

197
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,360
Research Institute in the Philippines

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
before joining our faculty here at

199
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,039
Cornell in

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,560
1995 Susan's Research into the genomic

201
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,759
variations of different varieties of

202
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,078
rice has led to the development of new

203
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,399
rice strains that are more Pest and

204
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,559
drought resistant and that provide

205
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,159
higher yields for farmers and very

206
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:34,039
importantly Susan's work has created a

207
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:37,600
more stable Global Supply of this

208
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,639
essential food source our next speaker

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,360
will be Greg Martin and Greg is a

210
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:44,679
professor of Plant Pathology and plant

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,639
microbiology and he is an expert on

212
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,719
tomato disease resistance since 2005 he

213
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,639
has been the Boyce schultzy Downey

214
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
professor at the Boyce Thompson

215
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,799
Institute for plant science here at

216
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:01,599
Cornell Greg received his BS his Ms and

217
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,000
PhD from Michigan State University and

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,040
he was a National Science Foundation

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,879
postdoctoral fellow at Cornell from 1989

220
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,679
to

221
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:14,120
1992 and it was as postto that Greg

222
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,879
worked in Steve tanksley's

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,320
laboratory Ste uh Greg's research

224
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,600
focuses on the mechanisms that bacteria

225
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,200
use to infect plants and in turn the

226
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,320
mechanisms that plants have evolved to

227
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,920
interfere with the bacterial

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,879
pathogen our third speaker this

229
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:36,479
afternoon is Jim giovanoni and he is an

230
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,320
Adjunct professor of plant biology in

231
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,680
the school of Integrative plant science

232
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,519
he's a research scientist for the US

233
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,159
Department of Agriculture agricultural

234
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,759
research service and he's a professor at

235
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:50,360
the Boyce Thompson Institute Jim earned

236
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,480
his PhD in molecular and physiological

237
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,959
plant biology at the University of

238
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,480
California Berkeley in 1990 and that was

239
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,199
followed by two years as post-doctoral

240
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,000
researcher

241
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,519
in Steve's lab so you see how this all

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,320
connects Jim was recently elected to the

243
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,919
National Academy of Sciences and let's

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,440
give Jim a round of applause for that

245
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,439
incredible

246
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:21,000
apption Jim's research focus is on the

247
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,839
molecular and genetic analysis of fruit

248
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,600
ripening and the cons and the

249
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,120
consequences of those um effects on

250
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
ripening on nutritional quality so now

251
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,759
I'm going to turn the podium over to

252
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,920
Susan makuch and Susan if you would join

253
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,879
me up here

254
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,278
please so it's a pleasure to be here and

255
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,639
uh this is of course honoring Steve it's

256
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,519
a rare opportunity that we get actually

257
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,159
to tell somebody who has influenced our

258
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,159
lives so deeply how much we appreciate

259
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,600
what they pass on and I think we all

260
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:54,639
know the importance of a professor so it

261
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,759
also resonates back to each of us as

262
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,879
professors uh hoping to influence

263
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,879
another generation of students

264
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,278
so this is the Steve tanksley I knew in

265
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,879
1986 when I joined his lab we were in

266
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,439
418 Bradfield Hall the department of

267
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,278
plant breeding and

268
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,639
biometry Steve arrived at Cornell with

269
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,240
big visions of what molecular genetics

270
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,600
could do for plant breeding for

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,560
agriculture and for Global Food security

272
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,278
and in 1986 the world faced many of the

273
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:33,198
same Grand global challenges that we

274
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,600
face today although I think the

275
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:36,599
understanding of what global climate

276
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,879
change would represent had not yet

277
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,159
become embedded in our minds in any case

278
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,600
Steve was bringing new tools and a new

279
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,120
vision to the Department of plant

280
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,560
breeding and biometry and molecular

281
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,639
markers would revolutionize the field of

282
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,479
plant

283
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,399
breeding and of molecular genetics

284
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,680
particularly interesting to me was that

285
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,440
it had immediate application in the

286
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,799
opportunity to translate the discoveries

287
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
that were being made in some of the

288
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,359
basic Sciences into important products

289
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,519
in agriculture medicine and

290
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,919
environmental science and to me this was

291
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,560
music to my

292
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,519
ears I had a background in history and

293
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,919
literature I was coming from a liberal

294
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,799
arts background I had lived and worked

295
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,240
extensively in the developing world and

296
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,639
during my first few weeks in the

297
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,120
tanksley lab I quickly realized that I

298
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,879
was going to have to learn an entire

299
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,919
enely new language it was one of the

300
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,159
most exciting periods of my

301
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:40,319
life I joined the team working to create

302
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,719
the first molecular map of rice and with

303
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
funding from the Rockefeller

304
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,199
foundation's program on International

305
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,239
rice

306
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:53,078
biotechnology I joined two colleagues

307
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,879
jenang Wang and XI Hong Yu who were

308
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:58,399
recent um recently emerged from the

309
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,439
cultural revolution in China this was

310
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,198
among the first wave of scientists to

311
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,000
come out of China and we were very uh

312
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,198
excited to have them in the lab working

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,958
on this the development of the rice map

314
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:13,958
it consisted of

315
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,599
135 rfl rflp markers and it was

316
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,719
published in theoretical and applied

317
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,600
genetics in

318
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,278
1988 when I finished my PhD in Steve's

319
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,120
lab in

320
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,759
1990 I took a position as a rice breeder

321
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,240
at the international rice Research

322
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,959
Institute in the Philippines and and I

323
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,120
worked there for 5 years during that

324
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:38,439
time we established the first molecular

325
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,000
marker lab which was called The genome

326
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,720
mapping lab and it was the foundation

327
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,240
for the application of genomics in

328
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,959
breeding at the time which was all

329
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,839
devoted to the concept of marker

330
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,719
assisted selection the lab remains

331
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,079
productive to this day and during the

332
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,000
time I was there one of the more

333
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,519
exciting aspects of being in the

334
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,440
Philippines other than the fact that I

335
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,919
had the rice patties right outside my

336
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,480
window was the fact that we had the Jean

337
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,759
bank right on campus and part of the

338
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,920
opportunity was to start to mine that

339
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,360
Gene bank for natural variation that we

340
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,078
could use in breeding and many of the

341
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,480
genes that are actually present in

342
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:19,758
ancient land races and wild species that

343
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,920
are housed in the irie Gene Bank have

344
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,399
now been deployed through the use of

345
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,120
this technology marker assisted

346
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,399
selection not GM technology but actually

347
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
through back Crossing have been deployed

348
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,639
to confer heightened levels of disease

349
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,240
and insect resistance drought tolerance

350
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,480
submergence tolerance and many other

351
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,198
traits and those varieties are now

352
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,639
planted on hundreds of thousands of

353
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:48,159
hectares across Asia Africa and Latin

354
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,079
America other students in the tanksley

355
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,958
lab built on the work that we had done

356
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:56,599
in rice using the rice genome as an

357
00:15:52,958 --> 00:16:00,078
anchor to start to map other related

358
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,480
genomes that were larger and more

359
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:06,359
complex the first comparative map was

360
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,319
the rice maze map and as you can see in

361
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,759
this uh diagram here we have a rice

362
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:15,240
chromosome in the middle and we have two

363
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,199
corresponding uh comparative segments

364
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,720
that were conserved in Ma and the

365
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,719
interesting thing about this is that

366
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,360
rice is a very small genome and it was a

367
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,480
fairly conservative and fairly uh stable

368
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,000
genome so it provided a very robust

369
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,519
framework for this comparative mapping

370
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,078
to assemble these much more complex

371
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,519
genomes and it demonstrated that these

372
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:43,120
related cereals they went on to develop

373
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:46,039
maps of rice wheat and Maze and

374
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,839
eventually many other comparative Maps

375
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,879
but these three related cereals which

376
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,880
are the foundation of the world's food

377
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:56,480
supply were mosaics of their last common

378
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,000
ancestor and they all shared large

379
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,600
segments of chromosomes that were still

380
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,439
recognizable after 3 million years of

381
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,959
evolution despite being rearranged and

382
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,679
reorganized in modern crop genomes for

383
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,640
those of you who are familiar with this

384
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,319
it's not surprising today but at the

385
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,480
time it was really a very profound uh

386
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:21,399
strategic concept that started to in

387
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,360
inundate the field of molecular biology

388
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,559
and molecular genetics and these

389
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,639
comparative Maps had enormous

390
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,240
implications for application in both

391
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,720
Agriculture and

392
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,000
medicine because of its small size the

393
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,400
rice genome was the the also the first

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,759
crop to be fully sequenced and it

395
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,960
provided a scaffold that allowed us to

396
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,519
more easily assemble the more complex uh

397
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,440
Maze and wheat

398
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,359
genomes now maze is six times larger

399
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,400
than rice it's about the size of the

400
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:56,000
human genome and it was a slow and

401
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,679
difficult process to assemble the genome

402
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,480
sequence of maze but even more difficult

403
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,360
was was wheat hexaploid wheat is 30

404
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,159
times the size of the maze genome and it

405
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,959
was only just recently completed in

406
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,679
2014 in any case the comparative Maps

407
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,319
laid the foundation for this major

408
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,038
accomplishment in the field of the plant

409
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:20,079
sciences and I might say also paved the

410
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,038
way for my return from Erie to join the

411
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,480
Cornell faculty in

412
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,759
1995 because it if it had not been that

413
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,279
Rice was the foundation for the more

414
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,400
important crops in the West nobody would

415
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,519
have thought of investing a faculty

416
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,720
position in a person who would devote

417
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,639
their life to

418
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,079
rice in any case with so much attention

419
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,080
focused on genotyping and sequencing of

420
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,480
genomes people sometimes seem to forget

421
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,399
the reason for doing it and the

422
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,240
creativity and effort that would be

423
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,480
needed to translate that sequence into

424
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,960
products that would ultimately impact

425
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,880
the human Li human Liv lives around the

426
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,880
world now I returned to uh joined the

427
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,159
faculty in 1995 and by

428
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,520
1995 things were starting to get

429
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,200
underway at Cornell many people were

430
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,720
involved in aspects of genomics but

431
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,038
everyone did it in their own lab B

432
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,480
buying their own Machines working

433
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,119
independently and ofing often having to

434
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,000
learn very difficult lessons each one on

435
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,759
their own and there was no forum for

436
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,679
sharing information and Technology

437
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,279
across the campus the way there is

438
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,360
today and Steve at that time had started

439
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,319
to think about what the implications of

440
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:43,119
the discoveries in the basic Sciences

441
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:45,158
meant for institutions and institutional

442
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,479
organizations and I'm going to quote to

443
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,120
you some actually I took this off of an

444
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,440
overhead slide and I thought of coming

445
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,279
in and putting up the overhead projector

446
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,558
so that you could actually see I still

447
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,839
have this this these slides in my in my

448
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,240
uh vast repertoire of old pap papers and

449
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,038
this is some of the these were some of

450
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,240
the insights that Steve uh shared with

451
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:09,558
many of us at that time the DNA sequence

452
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,599
will soon be known for most major life

453
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:16,000
forms not just for the major species but

454
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:18,199
for most major life forms and biology

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,960
will move from being an information

456
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,480
limited science to a science that is

457
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,400
limited only by our ability to organize

458
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,079
and analyze information and today we

459
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,038
live in the era of big data and digital

460
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,798
information and we all know what a

461
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,640
burden it is to have an overload of

462
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,720
information biological research will

463
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,320
shift from a reductionist to a synthesis

464
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,000
approach in fact it has dramatically

465
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:49,480
shifted from dissecting complex genomes

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,960
to predicting and synthesizing future

467
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,679
outcomes more basic discoveries will

468
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,519
emerge from biology in the next 30 Years

469
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,679
than from any other single discipline

470
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,400
well I joined Steve's lab in

471
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,720
1986 and here we are 30 years later I

472
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,759
would say we've had a pretty good

473
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,480
ride and Steve's one of the most lasting

474
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,798
contributions that Steve made to the

475
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,519
Cornell research Community was his

476
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,879
unswerving support and Leadership of the

477
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,000
Cornell genomics initiative under this

478
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,120
initiative we would initiate a new

479
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,839
campus-wide hiring strategy that allowed

480
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,199
candidates for faculty positions to

481
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:33,359
interview with prominent scientist s in

482
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,558
genomic related fields all across campus

483
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,959
we would form a set of core facilities

484
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:40,759
that provides the entire Cornell

485
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,600
community and survives to this day with

486
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,640
access to the latest in genomic

487
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,079
Technologies at a cost that was finally

488
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,559
manageable for Cornell researchers due

489
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,158
to the economy of scale that came from

490
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:57,119
uniting the campus and departmental and

491
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,360
college boundaries would be lowered as

492
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,839
faculty staff and student students

493
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,639
started to get to know each other

494
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:07,439
through their shared research interests

495
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,240
and the kind of uh consolidation and

496
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,640
interactions that I think Katherine

497
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,200
mentioned cut across many many different

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,720
colleges many different departments and

499
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,080
has affected the lives of many people

500
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,880
who were either at Cornell who or who

501
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,918
were recruited to Cornell under the

502
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,360
genomics

503
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,640
initiative when somebody says to you

504
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:34,158
well you know what you did for your PhD

505
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,840
that took you four years and was 135

506
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,520
markers on a map is going to be done in

507
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:42,319
10 minutes a few years later you kind of

508
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,839
look back at your thesis and you think

509
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,439
wow those were a lot of late nights in

510
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,240
the lab manually running gels and

511
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,840
waiting for things and turning them

512
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,359
around and all I can say is that it was

513
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,278
hard to imagine what somebody at that

514
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,639
time could have foreseen when we talked

515
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:03,119
about being in data Rich environment but

516
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,320
indeed I just want to end by saying that

517
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,959
currently the largest project in my

518
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,960
portfolio is called the Gobi project the

519
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,960
genomics and open- Source breeding

520
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,519
informatics initiative this is a project

521
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,240
funded by The Bill and Melinda Gates

522
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,558
Foundation there are four piis principal

523
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,319
investigators from plant breeding and

524
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:26,079
genetics alone one from bti and one from

525
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,918
computer science

526
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,319
department it is the objectives of this

527
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,240
Pro of this project are to program the

528
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,558
software that that is needed to

529
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,679
facilitate the use of big data in

530
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,720
breeding and the goal is to assist

531
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,120
breeders in the public sector working to

532
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,319
accelerate the rate of genetic gain for

533
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,439
staple food crops in the developing

534
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:51,480
world so you can see how this thread has

535
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,200
actually permeated my entire career here

536
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,319
and I just want to close by saying that

537
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,960
the Gobi project encompasses three

538
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,798
different International crop Improvement

539
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,159
centers simmit in Mexico rasat in irie

540
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,639
and rasat in India and irie in the

541
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,520
Philippines there are three institutions

542
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,400
right here in Ithaca all of whom have

543
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:18,359
pis on the table the USDA the Cornell uh

544
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,919
Cornell and that's cows n bti and we are

545
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:24,158
addressing simultaneously five of the

546
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:28,000
world's most important crop species rice

547
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:31,000
ma wheat sorghum and chickpea and this

548
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,798
is in fact I think a consolidation of

549
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,440
the vision that Steve expressed so many

550
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,440
years ago just to show you that Cornell

551
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,960
Still Remains I think a leader in the

552
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,200
field and I am very impressed Katherine

553
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,200
by your news today uh that the plant

554
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,519
Sciences is ranking so highly I must say

555
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,440
I'm not surprised but I think it's

556
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,319
important for us all to recognize the

557
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,480
Excellence that is housed here at

558
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,720
Cornell and with that I'll close by

559
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,519
saying I think I've done my part to

560
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
contribute to the Next Generation as

561
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:07,158
well so thank you very much

562
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:09,679
[Applause]

563
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,200
well thank you very much Susan and next

564
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,278
we will hear from Greg Martin so

565
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,399
Greg well I'd like to begin just uh

566
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:20,798
simply by thanking Steve for his

567
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:24,798
mentorship and for really his friendship

568
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,918
over many long period of time now so I

569
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,720
was actually also a beneficiary of the

570
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,600
Cornell genomics initiative because it

571
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,120
provided me an opportunity to return to

572
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,839
Cornell I first uh joined Steve's lab as

573
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,199
Katherine mentioned in

574
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:43,240
1989 which is hard to imagine that that

575
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,679
was actually 27 years ago and then uh

576
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,079
and then of course was then able to come

577
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,919
back in in 1998 I guess is what it was

578
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,000
so it's interesting for me reflecting

579
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,799
back in that period of time back in the

580
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,440
late 1980s and the early 1990s was it

581
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,158
turned out to Encompass a really

582
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,399
interesting intersection between two

583
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,559
important developments in in my field in

584
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:08,199
Plant Pathology and that is it was the

585
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:11,079
uh first development of new experimental

586
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,360
systems genetic systems that allowed the

587
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:16,158
genetic characterization of how plants

588
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,798
respond to pathogens and then of course

589
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,679
the second important development were

590
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,319
the methods of using DNA markers that

591
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,440
was spearheaded in Steve's lab and those

592
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,639
two different developments again

593
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,399
intersected and allowed then the

594
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,278
identifications of genes from plants

595
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,959
that confer disease resistance and that

596
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:36,519
uh ended up being the basis of my career

597
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,399
so what I want to do today is to give

598
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,119
you an overview a very kind of uh broad

599
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:44,158
overview of what we've learned in the

600
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,239
past 25 years about plant disease

601
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,399
resistance and then I'll touch a little

602
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,919
bit about how on about how we can use

603
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,319
this knowledge to to make better plants

604
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,240
to make plants more disease

605
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:59,398
resistant so if anyone is a home

606
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,120
Gardener you'll know that plant

607
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:05,558
succumb to all sorts of different

608
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:08,158
diseases they attack uh let's see stems

609
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:11,558
fruits leaves and not shown on this

610
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,000
slide but also Roots um they of course

611
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,759
have a huge impact they can have a huge

612
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,798
impact on yield but also on quality and

613
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,960
if you're a large farmer that affects

614
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,839
the marketability of the crop if you

615
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,240
like this kind of thing and I do they're

616
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,959
also really interesting to study

617
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,798
diseases because you can learn a lot

618
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,519
about about how the pathogens actually

619
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:35,960
cause symptoms how they were able to

620
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,879
suppress defense responses in the plant

621
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,640
so aside from the the fact that it's

622
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,240
just a lot of interesting biology and

623
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,559
it's kept my lab occupied for about 25

624
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,960
years of course plants also uh sorry

625
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,759
diseases also have a major impact on on

626
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,440
Plants so it's kind of hard for me to

627
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,798
see this up here but 10% of food

628
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:59,000
production it's estimated is lost due to

629
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,960
diseases um they it's to control

630
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,759
diseases and cost a lot of money and of

631
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,798
course involved the application of a lot

632
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,480
of

633
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:07,599
pesticides there have been a

634
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,240
introduction of important diseases into

635
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,519
the United States that have had a big

636
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,798
impact on all of us the the American

637
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,919
chestnut tree was lost to an exotic

638
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,798
pathogen that came in and of course

639
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,759
we're now currently dealing with Citrus

640
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,240
Greening which is shown here and then

641
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,038
the problem and it's just like the

642
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,839
problem with the super bugs that are in

643
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,480
the news recently is that plant

644
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,759
pathogens also evolve very quickly and

645
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,519
they develop resistance to uh different

646
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:38,119
pesticides that are currently being

647
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,640
used so the good news is that plants

648
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,918
actually have a very effective immune

649
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,759
system and in some ways it's analogous

650
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,159
to the human immune system and it's

651
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,759
important that some plants actually have

652
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,039
a natural of disease resistance in the

653
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,679
form of certain genes that allow them to

654
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,599
resist infection so this is a just a

655
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
simple picture that makes the point that

656
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,359
in this case both of these plants were

657
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,159
inoculated with the same bacterial

658
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,599
pathogen but you can see that one plant

659
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,519
appears to be uh completely resistant to

660
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,199
the disease it really doesn't show any

661
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,599
symptoms whereas the other one has

662
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,000
really succumbed to this disease so this

663
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,398
is an important point is that plants

664
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,079
naturally have these genes that confer

665
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,239
resistance so where do they come from

666
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,079
many of them have actually come from

667
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,278
Wild relatives of tomato and these were

668
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:32,439
collected back in the late 19 50s and

669
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,519
early 1960s by Dr Charles Rick who was

670
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,519
at the UC at University of California

671
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:40,319
Davis and was Steve's PhD adviser so

672
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,759
seeds of these uh different wild

673
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,158
relatives were collected and are

674
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,398
available now for us to analyze and

675
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
that's the sort of work that we've been

676
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:51,199
doing over the last 10 or 15 years is

677
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,960
screening these to identify new uh

678
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,278
disease resistance jeans that could then

679
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,360
be uh introduced into tomato varieties

680
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:02,119
so how do we do this it's a little bit

681
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,759
complicated and I'm not going to go into

682
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,359
all the details but the main point is is

683
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,960
that we're able to take advantage of

684
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,439
both sort of classical genetics and

685
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,159
classical Plant Pathology as well as a

686
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,759
lot of the more contemporary genomics

687
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,559
Technologies in order to very precisely

688
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:21,960
map a gene on a particular chromosome

689
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,398
get down to a very fine level and be

690
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,159
able to pick out the individual Gene

691
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,199
among the 35,000 or so genes that are in

692
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,799
tomato the individual Gene that's

693
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,600
important that is that's actually

694
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,398
conferring this disease resistance so as

695
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,918
Susan alluded to already this sort of

696
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,359
technology has really expedited things

697
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,720
25 years ago when I cloned a resistance

698
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,278
Gene when I was a postto in Steve's lab

699
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,759
it took four years and many many people

700
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,200
working on it uh we recently cloned a

701
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:53,119
gene and it took four months so that's

702
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,038
the sort of progress in the field we're

703
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,599
able to identify these genes much faster

704
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,558
and of course that will benefit the

705
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,199
plant breeding in the

706
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:04,918
future so what do these resistance genes

707
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,798
do uh I just sort of describe this in a

708
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,038
very simple way we now know that

709
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:13,240
resistance genes produce proteins and

710
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:15,919
these proteins allow the plant to detect

711
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,839
the pathogen so pathogens produce

712
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,880
certain proteins in their process of of

713
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,599
infecting the plant is in the process of

714
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,679
causing disease and these proteins that

715
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,918
resistance genes make we refer to as

716
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,240
receptors they can act either inside

717
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,880
inside the cell or outside the cell once

718
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,278
they detect a pathogen protein it

719
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,240
activates uh the immune response in the

720
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,720
plant and lead to disease

721
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,798
resistance so this is really kind of the

722
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,519
basic thing that we've learned in the

723
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:46,558
past 25 years but you can imagine with

724
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,638
so many people studying it in lots of

725
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,839
different Labs we actually know a little

726
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:53,798
bit more than what I'm showing and

727
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,439
that's Illustrated in this slide and

728
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:57,960
sort of again actually a rather

729
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,320
simplistic view of of what we actually

730
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,720
do know about the immune system we know

731
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,678
a lot of different components that act

732
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,919
both in recognizing the pathogen and in

733
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,200
the plant response how it actually uh

734
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,720
resists infection Downstream and so each

735
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,519
one of these different sort of items on

736
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,240
this slide represents a different

737
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,319
potential Target that plant breeders can

738
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,200
use to then uh introduce into new tomato

739
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,319
varieties and that's exactly what

740
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,600
they're doing using the sort of genomics

741
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,879
technology that was pioneered in Steve's

742
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,398
lab back in the in the late 1980s uh

743
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,399
plant breeders in this case tomato

744
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,879
breeders are using genomics Technologies

745
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,479
in particular DNA markers to be able to

746
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,278
very rapidly breed uh more disease

747
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,200
resistant

748
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:46,038
tomatoes so with that I'm just going to

749
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,840
end with this sort of a simple summary

750
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:51,440
slide to tell you that uh plants uh

751
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,839
sorry that diseases of course do have a

752
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,720
huge impact both in agricultural

753
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,158
settings but also uh to the impact the

754
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,240
economic impact on the farmer there's

755
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,919
been a lot of progress in understanding

756
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,440
exactly how the plant uh immune system

757
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,559
works and that's due to many different

758
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,600
labs and we've been fortunate to have

759
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,599
really an excellent level of federal

760
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:16,439
funding at least in the past 20 years or

761
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:18,638
so not as as much currently and that's

762
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,200
allowed a lot of progress in this field

763
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:22,638
and then as I mentioned the genomics

764
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,960
Technologies allow both the detailed

765
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,719
study of the immune system but they also

766
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,480
facilitate the breeding of of more

767
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,740
disease resistant plants

768
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:39,440
so I'll end with that thank you very

769
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:41,759
[Applause]

770
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,200
much well thank you very much Greg that

771
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,119
was great and now we'll hear from Jim

772
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,798
janon so

773
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:52,918
Jim okay well thank you very much first

774
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:55,440
I'd like to again thank Steve um you

775
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,278
really changed my life uh and in a a

776
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,720
very positive way so some people have

777
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:04,159
changed other ways but you had a great

778
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,558
impact um and I'd also like to thank you

779
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,960
and Susan and Greg because I never get

780
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,039
to talk to so many people so it's a it's

781
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,358
nice to have a big crowd

782
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:18,480
also um so I'm going to uh I guess tell

783
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,159
you a little story about some of our um

784
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,039
work some of the implications of our

785
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,838
work in Fruit development and fruit

786
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:28,159
biology but before that to really just

787
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:30,559
emphasize that it all started uh with

788
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,599
coming here to Cornell for a postto and

789
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:37,519
coming to Steve's lab um at the time as

790
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,639
Susan and Greg mentioned the technology

791
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,759
marker technology was being developed

792
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:46,079
and applied to both the utility and

793
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,240
genetic selection for breeding purposes

794
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,480
but also

795
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,799
towards understanding and identifying

796
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,199
genes so it's being used both for

797
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,800
practical and for basic biological

798
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,519
purposes and at the times the first

799
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,119
targets that Steve was approaching and

800
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,880
that Greg implemented was the cloning of

801
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:09,440
of the first disease resistance Gene uh

802
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,880
from a plant and but before that Jee had

803
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,079
been cloned I had met Steve and said

804
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,640
look I'm interested in fruit and these

805
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,160
funny ripening mutants and Steve said

806
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,838
yeah maybe there's something about those

807
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,239
disease genes that's not going to work

808
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:25,119
out so why don't you come and work on on

809
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,358
the fruit jeans just in case um because

810
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,358
the fact is disease resistance is much

811
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:33,319
more important you never get a fruit if

812
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:36,559
the plant is sick um so that's why I

813
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,320
ended up here um and uh and it was a

814
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:44,358
very good thing

815
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,680
okay so thinking about fruit um you know

816
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:50,519
we all know that in meeting our needs

817
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:53,519
for food security having enough to eat

818
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,639
in our state in our country in the world

819
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,719
we often think about yield but there's

820
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,639
another part of that equation and and

821
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,959
Greg alluded to it and that's how much

822
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:05,199
we can keep how much we can actually get

823
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,838
to the table so shelf life storability

824
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,318
these are all important seeds are

825
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,078
designed through Evolution to last right

826
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:14,759
they'll overwinter they'll make it to

827
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,000
the next year but the plant organs are

828
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,160
not necessarily so designed and so fruit

829
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,519
and vegetable tissues tissues of the

830
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,960
plant that we consume often have much

831
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,838
more of a problem in terms of

832
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,599
storability in terms of Decay and the

833
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:30,199
fruit in particular I is a is an

834
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,800
interesting organ because it's one

835
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:37,799
that's designed through Evolution to be

836
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,720
eaten so you think about um the fact

837
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,240
that uh most of what a plant is doing as

838
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,799
Greg just mentioned is defending itself

839
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,479
and suddenly in this stage of

840
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,720
development an organ is going just the

841
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,480
opposite saying come here and get me

842
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,799
consume me and to do so so as to release

843
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,119
the seeds because the fleshy fruit has

844
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,560
really evolved as a means of releasing

845
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,440
seeds uh for the Next

846
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,239
Generation but that process that makes

847
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,039
the fruit attractive the ripening

848
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:10,078
process also eventually leads to Decay

849
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,119
and that's the other part of our

850
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,720
equation in trying to meet our food

851
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:20,318
security needs how much can we produce

852
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:22,959
but also can we get it uh to the to the

853
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,800
consumer so this process that I've

854
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,720
mentioned or referred to as ripening is

855
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,880
really the sum of all those activities

856
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:33,439
the physi physiological changes the

857
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,480
biochemical changes that sum together to

858
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,119
make the fruit attractive to some

859
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,559
organism that will consume it and

860
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,119
Liberate the seeds and again if it

861
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:45,599
doesn't come along Plan B is become

862
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,920
susceptible to things that will rot the

863
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,599
fruit and let those seeds out so that's

864
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,039
always the challenge how do we get high

865
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,760
quality and something desirable to eat

866
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,920
without getting into that later phase of

867
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,640
what's referred to as overripening and

868
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,440
eventually Decay so fruits do a lot of

869
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:06,239
things uh and they don't all do the same

870
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,159
thing they accumulate different pigments

871
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,639
they become different colors some get

872
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,480
soft some don't get soft but they have

873
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,799
many of the similar properties so they

874
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,639
generally accumulate sugar they

875
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,920
generally produce volatile compounds

876
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,118
often compounds and these are what give

877
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,760
fruits their characteristic Aromas

878
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,000
they're attractants they smell nice to

879
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,359
you they're often derived from necessary

880
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,199
nutrients so they're also signals that

881
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,799
there is quality there Beyond uh just

882
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,559
something that's fun to eat it's

883
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,720
actually going to be good for you um

884
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,358
they again typically accumulate pigments

885
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:45,199
but different Pathways and different

886
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:47,400
fruits are activated and nutritional

887
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,000
content often changes in the fruit as

888
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,519
well and finally as noted in the corner

889
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,039
eventually they rot this is all part of

890
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:57,800
the same developmental process the same

891
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,920
genetically controlled program so all of

892
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,760
this is going on as the fruit reaches

893
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,000
that stage of

894
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,880
maturity and again the challenge is how

895
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,079
do we get it to the consumer without

896
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,280
losing too much of the crop to uh to

897
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,519
Decay and we put a lot of money into

898
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,800
this a lot of energy a lot of time we

899
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,880
hold things in uh modified atmosphere

900
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,039
storage this is an Apple Shed in the

901
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,680
Pacific Northwest where fruit are held

902
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:32,559
uh in modified CO2 and oxygen levels and

903
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:35,480
at low temperature and that allows us to

904
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,159
keep them for 9 months U Beyond Harvest

905
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,400
and get them to Market virtually all

906
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:43,920
year round uh but in certain parts of

907
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:47,720
the world uh often the the resources are

908
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,720
not available or the means for uh

909
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,399
sustaining uh quality product is not

910
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,439
necessarily there it's too expensive

911
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,720
it's simply not available the energy is

912
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,000
not there so we lose a lot and we lose

913
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,639
the most of parts of the world where we

914
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,480
need uh that food the most so it's a

915
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:07,000
challenge to address this problem and it

916
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,079
begins with us for really understanding

917
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,639
the basic biology of the ripening of the

918
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,560
fruit and uh we do this in tomato and

919
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:20,480
again because really in Steve's lab so

920
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:23,000
much was developed in terms of molecular

921
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,719
uh resources things like the genetic

922
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,880
Maps eventually the DNA sequence that

923
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:32,639
Steve really uh ch championed the the

924
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,720
sequencing effort in tomato and uh a

925
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,318
number of other attributes of those of

926
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,199
you who grow tomatoes in your backyards

927
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,599
no it's pretty easy so I can grow

928
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,679
tomatoes and without killing them uh off

929
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,280
uh the genetics is good because it's an

930
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,719
important crop breeders have collected a

931
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,519
lot of the type of genetic diversity of

932
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,439
wild species that Greg mentioned and

933
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,400
also just a lot of mutants because they

934
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,280
see interesting things they put them

935
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,079
into the the seed Storage Bank so

936
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,599
there's a lot of genetic material that

937
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:05,640
we can use to ask questions about plant

938
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,640
biology and particularly the

939
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:10,439
fruit so I mentioned the sequencing

940
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,639
effort I'm just going to highlight this

941
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,838
for a second because again this was

942
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:17,440
really Steve's Vision um and he got

943
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,199
together the group that started the

944
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,519
sequencing effort and it was you know

945
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:25,039
tomato is not a crop that is that

946
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:27,280
important anywhere for anybody to be

947
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,400
able to do it by themselves so you organ

948
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,839
ored an international Consortium that

949
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,599
that tackled this uh problem and this is

950
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,440
all the tomatoes represent the countries

951
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,400
where there was actually funding um

952
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,480
starting with a white paper that Steve

953
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,680
organized that everybody submitted to

954
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,358
their respective governments got money

955
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:50,279
to uh bring about this project and many

956
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:53,759
other countries who didn't have funded

957
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,680
grants also participated as well the US

958
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,599
was really the lead group uh and Steve

959
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,598
is biggest here not because he has the

960
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,280
biggest head but because he had the

961
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,480
biggest impact uh and but what I point

962
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,240
out with this slide these are all the

963
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,318
groups in the US and many of the people

964
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,838
here are people that either worked with

965
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,480
or were students here's Zack Litman one

966
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,719
of Steve's former students Andy

967
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,079
Patterson another former student Rod

968
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:20,719
Wing a former postto so many of the

969
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,240
people who are working on this project

970
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,358
as faculty had come out of Steve's lab

971
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:28,039
earlier

972
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,719
on and the sequence was is important not

973
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,519
just because tomato is important but

974
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:34,318
because it's closely related to a lot of

975
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:37,318
other important uh fruit and vegetable

976
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,880
crops potato eggplant pepper you combine

977
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:41,639
those tomato and you really have the

978
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,519
most important fruit and vegetable crops

979
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:48,000
in the world and even coffee is not so

980
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:50,639
distantly related and Susan showed you a

981
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,719
while ago the comparative Maps between

982
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,920
the cereals that were done with rice and

983
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,879
Maze but Steve had also done this

984
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,318
between tomato and coffee demonstrating

985
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,000
that these genomes are not that

986
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:03,318
different and that you can use one

987
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,880
genome to make inferences about the

988
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:10,400
other um one of the real um great

989
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,760
impacts of of uh of Steve's vision and

990
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
his

991
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,000
leadership so I'll spend a few more

992
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,119
minutes now kind of coming back um to

993
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,960
some of some of the things I did and put

994
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,640
it in the context of of how I ended up

995
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:30,760
here uh at Cornell also I did my PhD at

996
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:34,078
UC Berkeley in the late 1980s and I was

997
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,839
working on a gene in tomato called polyg

998
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,720
galacon and and uh that's referred to up

999
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,400
here with the PG polygalacturonase

1000
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,838
becomes very highly expressed in the

1001
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,519
ripening fruit it's uh the predominant

1002
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:49,519
protein in the cell walls of the fruit

1003
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,679
as they mature and what it does is it

1004
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,719
breaks down the pectin in between the

1005
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,879
cells so think of a brick wall and if

1006
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,199
all the mortar started liquefying that's

1007
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,838
what polygalacturonase does it breaks

1008
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:04,598
that down it was thought that that

1009
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,000
caused the fruit to soften and so a

1010
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,480
company you may have heard of called

1011
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,559
Calene said let's make a genetically

1012
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,358
engineered tomato that won't soften

1013
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,359
it'll last longer we can leave it on the

1014
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,279
vine longer it'll taste better because

1015
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,000
we don't have to harvest it too early

1016
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,359
just so that we can ship it across the

1017
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,920
country uh and I assume probably many of

1018
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,039
you have heard of the flavor saver

1019
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,720
tomato and Calene and that was the first

1020
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,358
GM crop so so I was doing my PhD and it

1021
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,879
was actually to test the function of

1022
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:36,318
that Gene and my PhD was that's not

1023
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,160
going to work so what we did was Express

1024
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:40,639
that we did the opposite experiment we

1025
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,199
overexpressed it in a hard green fruit

1026
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,558
and said does it get soft the answer was

1027
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:48,799
no the hard green fruit we used were a

1028
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,839
mutation called the ren mutation or

1029
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,359
ripening inhibitor that actually arose

1030
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,519
spontaneously here on the Cornell campus

1031
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,318
in Henry munger's Greenhouse so Henry

1032
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:04,000
Munger former Alum and also a faculty

1033
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:05,880
for nearly 40 years passed away recently

1034
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,559
uh was in the plant breathing Department

1035
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,720
here and this mutation arose

1036
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,920
spontaneously in his Greenhouse the

1037
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,759
fruit do not ripen at all that let me

1038
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,960
test that hypothesis but it also made me

1039
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,640
much more interested in well what's

1040
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,639
wrong with this fruit that it won't

1041
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,799
ripen and that's what led me to Steve's

1042
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,440
lab because he was pioneering the

1043
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,359
technology that allowed one to go from a

1044
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,838
phenotype to the that underlies that

1045
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:32,799
defect um so that's why I was here in

1046
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,679
the early '90s I was actually in the

1047
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,519
same aisle as Greg Martin we were

1048
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,358
bouncing into each other not as much as

1049
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:43,358
we would now I was much smaller then um

1050
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:45,679
but still did once in a while so the the

1051
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,000
ren mutation what I just showed you and

1052
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,000
and you can see again here is a

1053
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,239
homozygous mutant fruit never ripens so

1054
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,559
that's a pretty serious defect it

1055
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,279
actually has practical utility a lot of

1056
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,880
it it's used very widely and Commercial

1057
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,160
Tomatoes as a heterozygote where you now

1058
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,039
get a long shelf life slow ripening

1059
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,639
tomato that nobody likes right everybody

1060
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,358
Tomatoes never taste as good as they do

1061
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,960
when I grow them in the backyard this is

1062
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:13,358
one main reason why but they do have

1063
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,440
long shelf life you can ship them across

1064
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,480
the country easily and it's really

1065
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,358
partly because we haven't focused too

1066
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,519
much on the quality we primarily focus

1067
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:24,960
on making sure we can produce the crop

1068
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:28,759
and get it to Market but a lot of the

1069
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,639
Breeders now uh uh are focusing back on

1070
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,520
the quality of the fruit but again our

1071
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:36,358
interest was this must be something

1072
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,519
really important if you can alter this

1073
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,519
single Gene and and have such a big

1074
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:43,400
impact on the ripening of the fruit and

1075
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,400
so in our lab and work I started in

1076
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,079
Steve's lab and then completed a little

1077
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,960
bit later we identified the underlying

1078
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,680
Gene it's a transcription Factor so it's

1079
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:58,039
a a master regulator of other genes and

1080
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:59,799
uh it basically we know now controls

1081
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:02,358
almost every Gene that we know is

1082
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,160
involved in ripening or has a change of

1083
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:07,598
expression in ripening this Gene sits on

1084
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:10,759
its promoter and influences its

1085
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:14,000
expression so it's a key regulator there

1086
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,200
are many other interesting tomato fruit

1087
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,280
mutants in implementing these same kinds

1088
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:22,519
of positional cloning technologies that

1089
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,480
Greg mentioned earlier we've identified

1090
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:26,960
many of those genes as well in fact

1091
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,240
virtually every important or kind of

1092
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,838
major effect mutation in tomato has now

1093
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:33,639
been cloned either by our group or in

1094
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,400
collaboration with

1095
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:39,639
others and Julia rebov who did a lot of

1096
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,400
this work is a former uh Cornella lump

1097
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:45,118
she received her PhD here um and we one

1098
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,720
of the interesting things we've done is

1099
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,680
once we had this Gene we asked well is

1100
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:52,039
this just tomato or is it other species

1101
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,480
we know now working with a number of

1102
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:57,558
collaborators generating Knockouts in

1103
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,119
this Gene through GMOs and banana and

1104
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,640
melon and strawberry that this Gene's

1105
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,519
very well conserved and if you alter its

1106
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,318
expression you alter the ripening of the

1107
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:09,759
fruit so it's a very basic regulator of

1108
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:12,119
ripening and it's a very well conserved

1109
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,760
through Evolution regulator of ripening

1110
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,680
so if you're interested in controlling

1111
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,400
shelf life variation in a gene like this

1112
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,639
is probably one you should be looking

1113
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,400
at as I mentioned there are a lot of

1114
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:26,759
other interesting mutants I'll just

1115
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,880
point out one U here that we've

1116
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,359
identified the gene for another Cornell

1117
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,880
Alum Kong Wen did his PhD on this uh

1118
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:37,279
this is a gene called uniform ripening

1119
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,920
so this is a a wild type non-mutant

1120
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,559
tomato it has this kind of green

1121
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,639
shoulder on the top most Tomatoes you'll

1122
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:46,000
find in the supermarket carry the

1123
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:48,679
uniform ripening mutation so they're

1124
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,599
uniform in color when they ripen they'll

1125
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:53,639
be uniform red the older varieties and

1126
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:55,559
you know if you're interested in

1127
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,440
heirloom tomatoes one marker of an

1128
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,798
heirloom is if they have the green

1129
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,960
shoulder um it's thought that that's not

1130
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:04,798
a nice appearance so it's been bred out

1131
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,798
using the uniform mutation what we know

1132
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:09,798
now is this is another transcription

1133
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:12,199
factor that greenness up here is of

1134
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:14,159
course due to chlorophyll if you remove

1135
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,960
that you have less chlorophyll you end

1136
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,159
up with less sugar you have less

1137
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,318
chloroplasts so you also get less

1138
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:24,358
carotenoids you actually have probably a

1139
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:26,400
less nutritious fruit but it looks nice

1140
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:29,480
um so but it's an unintended consequence

1141
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,559
and we understand this now and uh we can

1142
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,519
probably do things about that because of

1143
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,160
that knowledge to bring back some of

1144
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,318
that

1145
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:40,480
quality as Greg mentioned we're also

1146
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:42,920
using genetic diversity now to look at

1147
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,880
um to basically to identify additional

1148
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,280
genes for which we don't have mutations

1149
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,200
uh but for which there is uh diversity

1150
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,760
in the wild germ plasm and this is just

1151
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,759
um an example of a

1152
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,040
population that was developed largely

1153
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,799
using the marker technology that Steve

1154
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,639
had had developed um and he's also

1155
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,960
developed some of these populations in

1156
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,199
his work as well here we're just looking

1157
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,639
we're interested in in the nutritional

1158
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:12,679
quality and one of the main attributes

1159
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:15,440
of that in tomato is the carotenoids

1160
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,759
lopine beta carotene that gives them

1161
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,480
their typical orange reddish colors and

1162
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,200
I think you can see just looking over

1163
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,639
this slide there's a lot of variation if

1164
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,519
we extract those and measure them and

1165
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,679
just plot the different compounds across

1166
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:32,199
the different lines you can see a lot of

1167
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,719
variation in different nutritional

1168
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:37,480
compounds so we're using that now to map

1169
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:40,879
new Loi and identify new genes that

1170
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,880
regulate this particular pathway and the

1171
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,559
outcomes and again this was another

1172
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,280
Cornell Alum um Ryan mcquinn who

1173
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:50,359
received his PhD here just last year who

1174
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,160
did a lot of this

1175
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:56,358
work so I thought I'd end if I have a

1176
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:59,000
minute to end with just one last slide

1177
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:01,318
about about you know who are our our

1178
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,760
greatest faculty and of course we can

1179
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:06,318
replace this word here with Steve tley

1180
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,280
these two words so he fits all of them

1181
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:12,119
and uh we didn't coordinate but you

1182
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,280
heard a lot of these words uh from Susan

1183
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,039
from the dean from Greg earlier uh so

1184
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,640
I'm glad to see we're all thinking of

1185
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:22,119
the same things when we're thinking of

1186
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:24,400
Steve an educator an innovator not just

1187
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:26,720
in science but also in the in the

1188
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,880
university community and how science is

1189
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:32,039
done uh Vision to see things I think

1190
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,680
Susan showed that very well with her

1191
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:38,199
slide um you know when we were sitting

1192
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:40,480
here uh running gels it was hard I think

1193
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:42,719
certainly for me to imagine where we

1194
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,920
would be now and I think Steve saw that

1195
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,919
coming and help bring us there so that

1196
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,798
leadership as well and the most

1197
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,519
important thing I think is still a human

1198
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:56,000
being in the end very compassionate

1199
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:57,280
person um and also sometimes he helps

1200
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,119
keep you out of

1201
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,760
jail um so I'll tell you a little story

1202
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,160
it's not not as bad as it sounds but

1203
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,160
when I was a postto here I was out in

1204
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,440
the field in Varna you know where Varna

1205
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,279
is down

1206
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,838
366 Steve had his tomato Fields there

1207
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,880
and it was a Saturday morning and I was

1208
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:19,838
out with another postto Rod wi and we

1209
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,358
were harvesting tomatoes from our uh

1210
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,199
crosses so these wild species crosses

1211
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:28,838
they make little tiny

1212
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:31,318
tomatoes and along Along came a Cornell

1213
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:32,759
University Police Officer wondering what

1214
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:34,599
we were doing out there on a Saturday

1215
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,319
morning picking tomatoes he thought we

1216
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:40,359
were stealing them he didn't seem to buy

1217
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:42,719
the fact that across directly 12T away

1218
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,239
from us was Martha much's field for

1219
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,838
breeding tomatoes that had these big

1220
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,679
beautiful tomatoes and we had all these

1221
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,599
little tiny orange tomatoes so he gave

1222
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,358
us a

1223
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,640
test it's not the kind of test you see

1224
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,719
here but he would turned out was a

1225
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:59,039
recent Cornell Grant he gave us a plan

1226
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,439
physiology test in the

1227
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,318
field we couldn't believe it and the

1228
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,920
funniest thing was both rod and I were

1229
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:07,480
do you know that do you know started

1230
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,400
asking us about photosynthesis about

1231
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,639
hormones he had taken a hormone uh from

1232
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,838
uh from Peter

1233
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:18,879
Davies uh very uh very uh excited young

1234
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:20,639
police officer and after that we told

1235
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,720
Steve of course we tried calling Steve

1236
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,598
there was no cell phones in those days

1237
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,959
so he was calling into the police

1238
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:30,200
station to call steveen lab who was in

1239
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,920
the greenhouse so we couldn't get

1240
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,838
rescued by Steve but after that we

1241
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,880
always carried a letter from Steve out

1242
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:40,039
in the field saying we actually worked

1243
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:44,160
from him and we were not um tomato

1244
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:47,558
thieves so so um yeah that was quite an

1245
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:50,078
experience so I I will end there uh and

1246
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:52,480
just uh thank again all of you for

1247
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,210
coming today and uh and thanks Steve for

1248
00:53:52,480 --> 00:54:02,240
so much

1249
00:53:54,210 --> 00:54:04,720
[Applause]

1250
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,039
and now if I could ask Susan and Greg to

1251
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,439
please join us all up on the stage we're

1252
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,440
going I have a a series of questions

1253
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,880
that I'll be asking our panelists and

1254
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,720
then I'll open up the conversation to

1255
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,240
everyone who's here today but I cannot

1256
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:24,078
tell you how happy I am to finally learn

1257
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:27,639
the answer to the riddle why those

1258
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,920
Supermarket tomatoes never taste as good

1259
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,879
as the ones you grow yourself so Rin

1260
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,880
I've got that now that's terrific so

1261
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,798
anyway let's start our

1262
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,720
conversation uh here among our group and

1263
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:43,440
the first question that I'd like to ask

1264
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:46,598
our panel here is what do you see on the

1265
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,760
horizon what are the the the the number

1266
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:50,480
one Challenger question I'd like to hear

1267
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,799
from each of you that you see on the

1268
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,400
horizon that will be important for plant

1269
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,289
scientists to research and address in

1270
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,369
the coming decade

1271
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:00,369
[Music]

1272
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:04,399
just like that just like

1273
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:14,639
that so one of the things that I think

1274
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:18,000
is really exciting is how to develop and

1275
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:21,318
deploy diversity meaning genetic

1276
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,400
variation in time and space in a way

1277
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,960
that will help us mitigate the effects

1278
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,400
of the variability of the climate so if

1279
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,240
you can't predict something you can't

1280
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,200
you can't really work with a uniform

1281
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,078
agricultural system you have to now

1282
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:36,078
reintroduce diversity how are we going

1283
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,480
to do it what's it going to look like

1284
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,720
and how are we going to manage it so

1285
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:44,440
that it's actually both productive and

1286
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:47,959
um appropriate for the challenges at

1287
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,720
hand I guess we

1288
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,880
here well I think uh I I try to sort of

1289
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,279
illustrate this in my talk in my field I

1290
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,119
think the biggest challenge is how we're

1291
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,559
now going to start to take advantage

1292
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,760
really of what we've learned over the

1293
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,400
past 20 or 25 years about the immune

1294
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,960
system we've we know a lot about it we

1295
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,599
know about the individual genes but

1296
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,798
we're just at the sort of uh inflection

1297
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:13,680
point of now starting to uh use those

1298
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:15,318
into improve disease resistance in the

1299
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:17,679
field and that's going to be really

1300
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:19,558
important I mentioned also super bugs in

1301
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,038
the news that does happen with plant

1302
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:25,079
pathogens and we need to be able to

1303
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,440
understand how to actually use multiple

1304
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,880
resistance genes in the same variety to

1305
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,679
be able to uh thwart the attack of these

1306
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,798
kind of super bugs that are always

1307
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,798
evolving out

1308
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,599
there I guess uh I mean one way I would

1309
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:45,000
answer that is what keeps me up at night

1310
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:48,519
which is what what do we do with all the

1311
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,960
data I we generate I mean and this is I

1312
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:54,519
speak for myself we generate so much

1313
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:57,159
data that we uh maybe pick a few

1314
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:59,920
cherries from or or anal Anze in a very

1315
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:02,000
specific way and extract some nugget

1316
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,240
from but there is so much more potential

1317
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,358
there uh and I think you know actually

1318
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:10,239
being able to take advantage of all the

1319
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,480
data that we generate um more

1320
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:14,919
efficiently than than I know at least I

1321
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,199
do now I think is one of the the big

1322
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,240
challenges uh probably for many groups

1323
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,000
certainly for our group The the good

1324
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,879
news is that I think we're all thinking

1325
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,480
about that and we're starting to address

1326
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,079
it you see that in the types of people

1327
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,000
you know we hire there's much more you

1328
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,760
now the typical student I think in the

1329
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,880
lab is spending half their time at the

1330
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,039
bench and half their time doing

1331
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,480
computational work so that they are

1332
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:42,240
certainly changing how they do things

1333
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:45,000
but I still look back and see we

1334
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:47,399
generate so much that we really just

1335
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,920
scrape the surface off of so I think

1336
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,480
that's an opportunity it's not a

1337
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,519
negative thing but it's something

1338
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,000
certainly we need to figure out how to

1339
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:57,119
take better advantage of a terrific

1340
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,798
theme in all three of the is about

1341
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,680
complexity and complexity of biological

1342
00:57:59,798 --> 00:58:04,599
systems and taking advantage of what we

1343
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:07,838
can learn from that so terrific now you

1344
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:10,318
all are renowned scientists and and you

1345
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:13,358
come from from years in fact of of

1346
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,558
focusing on scientific questions as

1347
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:18,838
scientists what would you like the

1348
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:22,000
nonscience community to know about plant

1349
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:24,679
biology and genomics what what would you

1350
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,119
say if you could distill it into the

1351
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:27,519
most critical thing for nonscience

1352
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,000
scientists to wrap their head around

1353
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,000
what would that

1354
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,240
be I could start off with that I think

1355
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,520
for me it was sort of a revelation I was

1356
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:41,959
at a dinner party two or three years ago

1357
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,759
and and somebody asked me what I worked

1358
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,559
on and I started talking about the plant

1359
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,440
immune system and many people just kind

1360
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,359
of stared at me blankly because they

1361
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,880
hadn't really thought about the fact

1362
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:54,199
that plants have an immune system and so

1363
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,720
I guess that's the one thing I'd like to

1364
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:58,239
be able to communicate to to people into

1365
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,679
the public is that plants do have an

1366
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:03,038
immune system it has a lot of really

1367
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:05,159
fascinating aspects to it a lot of

1368
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,920
parallels actually to the human immune

1369
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,960
system and what we uh learn in plants is

1370
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,079
of course important for making disease

1371
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,039
resistant plants but it's also can have

1372
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:17,440
an impact in how we understand the human

1373
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,440
immune

1374
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:23,920
system

1375
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:27,920
ahead I was still

1376
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:32,119
thinking um I I guess you know maybe one

1377
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:35,920
of the most important things um is to

1378
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:37,519
just uh keep in mind how much potential

1379
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,358
there is out there I think I think it's

1380
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:45,079
so easy to go to the supermarket and you

1381
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:47,078
see a ear of corn or a a a fluet of

1382
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:49,720
broccoli and you think that's it you

1383
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:52,519
know that that is broccoli that is corn

1384
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:56,159
that's a tomato and there's so much

1385
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:58,038
diversity that we still don't exploit in

1386
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:01,159
crop breeding there's so many

1387
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:03,440
opportunities to bring in new traits to

1388
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:06,159
bring in more disease resistance to

1389
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,119
bring in different fruit quality uh that

1390
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,719
there's a lot more out there and that it

1391
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:13,119
I think Al also a lot of people when you

1392
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,078
think about something different I know

1393
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,280
what if I always get asked you are those

1394
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:20,680
orange Tomatoes GMOs or how about the

1395
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,640
yellow ones um and you know all of that

1396
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:26,118
is non- GMO there's no GMO tomato out in

1397
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:28,879
the marketplace so this is all natural

1398
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:31,920
genetic diversity that's being brought

1399
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,519
into uh modern breeding programs and

1400
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:38,720
there's still just a tiny tip of the

1401
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:38,719
iceberg of what's potential that's being

1402
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,880
exploited I think one of the things that

1403
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:49,519
has always impacted me a lot is to look

1404
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,119
back at the underlying commonality that

1405
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:53,920
all living things

1406
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,599
share and that's the reason

1407
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,920
why comparative Maps

1408
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,838
work it's the why it's the reason why

1409
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,039
you can take a gene out of one organism

1410
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:05,279
and put it in another is because

1411
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:09,280
fundamentally living

1412
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,559
things honestly they at their B at their

1413
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,599
base genetic level they're very similar

1414
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:17,160
and they function in very similar ways

1415
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,440
and so I wish that the public could

1416
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:22,838
understand that that we're not so

1417
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,920
different in many ways we look and

1418
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:27,239
appear different and we emphasize our

1419
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,440
diversity but fundamentally underlying

1420
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:33,519
that diversity is this incredibly common

1421
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:36,440
origin that we share and that's a very

1422
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,559
profound thing that genomics has helped

1423
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:42,000
us to

1424
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:45,319
understand thank you those are great now

1425
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
switching just a little bit how are the

1426
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:52,079
objectives of plant science research

1427
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,639
influenced and changing in the context

1428
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:58,519
of climate change in the context of

1429
01:01:54,639 --> 01:02:00,278
globalization population growth and how

1430
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:03,960
we are going to feed our global

1431
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:06,039
population so how how do you see plant

1432
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,960
science changing to address these

1433
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:08,960
emerging Global

1434
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,519
needs it's obviously a really big

1435
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:18,440
question a lot of really huge problems I

1436
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:20,679
guess the one that I think a lot about

1437
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,760
because it really does impact the what

1438
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:25,278
I'm working on and that is that climate

1439
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:28,160
change is going to have a huge impact

1440
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:30,440
actually on diseases because as as the

1441
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,399
climate changes different pathogens are

1442
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,318
able to adapt so we're going to see

1443
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,039
entirely new diseases start to develop

1444
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:40,239
that we just haven't had a problem with

1445
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:42,079
in the last you know 20 or 30 years and

1446
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,879
uh yeah disease are going to appear in

1447
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,640
different uh further north than they

1448
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,318
used to and further south in different

1449
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:50,078
crops so that's going to be a huge uh

1450
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:54,079
problem going forward and it's and it's

1451
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,079
and it's due to climate change

1452
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,079
I think we can already see an emphasis

1453
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,880
on local production and I think that the

1454
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,760
return to thinking about being locally a

1455
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,960
little bit more self-sufficient and less

1456
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,680
dependent on some Grand scale is very

1457
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,960
important in the face of both population

1458
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:20,278
pressure climate change and also our

1459
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,318
appreciation of the varying interests

1460
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:24,559
and um let's say preferences that

1461
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:27,400
different consumer communities have and

1462
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,760
so it's both out of interest for the

1463
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,680
diversity and it's also out of I think a

1464
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,400
need to find a system that has both a

1465
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:37,639
local as well as a a more Global content

1466
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,480
that I think that emphasis is a growing

1467
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:43,239
one and one that's quite healthy for us

1468
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,400
to have an much more direct connection

1469
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:50,798
to our food supply our water supply and

1470
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,798
the sources of things that we need to

1471
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,639
survive I I think my colleagues have uh

1472
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,960
have covered these big topics very well

1473
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:02,598
I'll focus a little bit on the fruit um

1474
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,679
and I think you see certainly the

1475
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:05,680
effects of

1476
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,000
globalization right you get Summer

1477
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:11,798
fruits all year round now because they

1478
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
come from someone else's summer um and

1479
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:16,119
but you know and they're different often

1480
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,440
different varieties they're growing in

1481
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,880
in different uh growing regions maybe

1482
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,079
different climates so they're not

1483
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,079
necessarily the same varieties you would

1484
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,880
be seeing in the summer here say if

1485
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,278
you're looking at peaches or something

1486
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,920
like that uh so that it's from that

1487
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:33,719
perspective there's certainly a lot more

1488
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:36,720
uh opportunity there's a lot more things

1489
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:39,159
that maybe we didn't have uh not so long

1490
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:43,000
ago but at the same time there are you

1491
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:45,558
know the challenges of growing just U

1492
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,278
you know a narrow selection of genetic

1493
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,359
diversity I think we probably often

1494
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:52,119
appreciate that there isn't the quality

1495
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:54,519
you get when you have something locally

1496
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:57,400
grown because you're dealing with all

1497
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:00,000
the realities of of uh shipping and

1498
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:03,240
transport and storage it's often it's

1499
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,838
just hard to get that same uh quality

1500
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:08,239
that you can get from something that's

1501
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:10,119
fully matured on a plant that is close

1502
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,759
by and then picked the day before and

1503
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:15,318
brought to you uh so I think in the end

1504
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,240
I think what all this represents is just

1505
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:20,000
a lot more opportunity for plant

1506
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:21,919
scientists like us because as we

1507
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,400
understand better the biology of these

1508
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,639
systems we'll be able to understand

1509
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,440
which of these issues we can actually do

1510
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,920
something about which are going to be

1511
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,240
more difficult which which maybe there

1512
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:37,760
is no really good solution right now um

1513
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:40,679
so I I think you know these um big

1514
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:43,200
issues are impacting all of us and we

1515
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:46,038
think about them all the time in our

1516
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:48,278
research um and they do certainly change

1517
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,079
how we how we focus our research and

1518
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:52,358
certainly where the money comes from to

1519
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,680
do our

1520
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:58,278
research okay now this is your cue this

1521
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,759
this is the last question coming for me

1522
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:03,039
before we open up the conversation to

1523
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:06,920
the audience and and it's intentionally

1524
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:09,799
meant to be provocative and that is how

1525
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:13,119
do you see GMOs fitting into the current

1526
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:15,559
research arena in the plant sciences and

1527
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:19,400
tell us if you see Alternatives perhaps

1528
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:21,359
to to the strategy for uh creating uh

1529
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,039
plant varieties that we will need to

1530
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,960
address some of the issues that we've

1531
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,960
been discussing here

1532
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,559
well my my research has taken tremendous

1533
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,559
advantage of GMO technology over the

1534
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:37,798
past 25 years we couldn't have done many

1535
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:41,760
of the experiments that we have done

1536
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:43,639
without GMO technology um obviously

1537
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,160
commercialization uh using GMO

1538
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:48,078
technology has met a tremendous amount

1539
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:49,838
of resistance from the public and and

1540
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,000
the uh the good news there is that there

1541
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,599
is a new technology available now it's

1542
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,358
being referred to as genome editing you

1543
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:59,000
might be hearing about it on the on the

1544
01:06:56,358 --> 01:07:01,519
news and in the newspaper so it really

1545
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,318
is a new technology that so far is not

1546
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:07,318
being considered GMO it really isn't a a

1547
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:10,079
genetic or GMO it doesn't fit that def

1548
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:13,038
definition of GMOs and allows a very

1549
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,440
precise uh change to be made in a plant

1550
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,760
genome and so the good news is is that

1551
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,838
it looks like this is not going to have

1552
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,278
as much uh regulation and hopefully not

1553
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:25,159
as much concern on the part of the

1554
01:07:22,278 --> 01:07:28,358
public in its use and it'll be more

1555
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,358
it'll be be used more

1556
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:35,000
[Music]

1557
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:38,199
widespread

1558
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,880
ready I I I was yeah just kind of

1559
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:43,318
jumping to the microphone because I I

1560
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,318
think in a lot of ways the the path that

1561
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:47,880
uh some of the work we do and Greg does

1562
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:49,838
is similar we identify genes that we

1563
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,000
think are responsible for a process and

1564
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:55,599
we often test that function in a GMO

1565
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,798
plant we alter its expression we

1566
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,798
overexpress it and we asked does it

1567
01:07:57,798 --> 01:08:02,239
change the trait that we think it might

1568
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:04,920
be changing so it as a research tool

1569
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:06,639
it's certainly extremely important but

1570
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,240
again as as Greg mentioned there's been

1571
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,598
a lot of resistance um you know

1572
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:14,838
something like tomato after flavor saver

1573
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:18,600
it's been uh 25 years there hasn't been

1574
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:21,679
another GMO tomato um so there are new

1575
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,319
technologies and I think also with uh

1576
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,679
more appreciation and more exploitation

1577
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:29,640
of available genetic diversity there's

1578
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:33,239
more opportunities for solutions that

1579
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:35,480
don't necessarily necessitate a GMO

1580
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:38,238
approach so and I think practically

1581
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:40,759
that's probably where a lot of the the

1582
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:43,879
seed companies are focusing if I can

1583
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:47,119
solve this problem by using available

1584
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:51,119
genetic diversity why get into the the

1585
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,119
the storm of uh GMO

1586
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:58,640
controversy I think one of the

1587
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:59,479
underlying reasons why GM technology is

1588
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,719
is

1589
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:08,358
so considered so essential in some of

1590
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:10,158
the uh in some of the big a applications

1591
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:12,000
is because it's easy to patent because

1592
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,000
you can see it because you can prove it

1593
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,119
because you can prove it's yours okay so

1594
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,798
you can defend it so that's very

1595
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,759
important what's interesting about the

1596
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:23,759
new technology is that as Greg started

1597
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:27,000
to say you can do something very

1598
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:30,279
precisely and it leaves no Trace no

1599
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,359
footprint no fingerprint it would look

1600
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:34,960
just

1601
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:38,520
like nature does it it's a mutation

1602
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:41,719
exactly like what nature does so I think

1603
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:44,679
what's interesting is will the public

1604
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,798
now that the human can do what Nature

1605
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:48,480
has done

1606
01:09:45,798 --> 01:09:51,838
before will the human find that

1607
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:53,798
acceptable or if the intervention of the

1608
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,158
human not the thing itself but the

1609
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:59,279
intervention of the human is the thing

1610
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:01,079
the public objects to will that then be

1611
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,000
the grounds for further rejection but

1612
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:06,119
what if you can't prove it so we're

1613
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,679
entering a whole new terrain I think

1614
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:13,279
of really

1615
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:17,279
complicated uh Concepts about ownership

1616
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:19,960
and the defense of patents if this new

1617
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:23,039
technology leaves no footprint and I

1618
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,960
will say that I think it's both um an

1619
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:27,238
opportunity and it's very terrifying at

1620
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,158
the same time time and I think that we

1621
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:34,079
should all be quite thoughtful about

1622
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:36,238
what it is that we're willing to do and

1623
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,840
yet at the same time I think if if

1624
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,079
you're the one who's faced with the zika

1625
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,560
virus or you're the one who's faced with

1626
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:47,399
a malarial epidemic that can no longer

1627
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:51,000
be treated by any antibiotic or any uh

1628
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:54,639
there's no medicine to treat

1629
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,920
something would you just sit down and

1630
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,280
let that m microbial population overtake

1631
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,480
your life so I just feel like we're at

1632
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:03,920
the moment of real

1633
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:06,079
ethical turning points and it's going to

1634
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,840
take it's not about whether it's good or

1635
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,399
bad it's just going to take a lot of

1636
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,960
real thought on the part of many many

1637
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:15,799
people to understand when and how and

1638
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,119
under what conditions we use the

1639
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:22,760
technology that the human being is

1640
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:26,000
endowed by nature to be able to conceive

1641
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:30,280
of and develop because that's who we are

1642
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,479
too anyway I find it to be worthy of

1643
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:35,920
great thought and I'm not ready to say

1644
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:37,158
it's uh A Brave New World or not I just

1645
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,520
I think we're at

1646
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:41,759
the we're entering into some very

1647
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,000
unknown

1648
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,280
territory that was very profound and at

1649
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,960
this moment I'd like to open to the

1650
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,840
floor uh further questions that you

1651
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:55,039
might have and uh I think our panelists

1652
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,600
might be willing to stay um after for a

1653
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,719
little little bit if you would prefer to

1654
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,320
do one-on-one conversations for a little

1655
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,719
bit anyway but we have our first

1656
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:02,719
question

1657
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:09,679
here yes I've been confused about uh the

1658
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,879
Uproar over GMOs because I've always

1659
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:15,279
thought it was a great idea but it

1660
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,159
appears that the uh objection relates

1661
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:20,840
more to the kind of

1662
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:23,759
chemicals uh that have been the Monsanto

1663
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:28,039
uh curse I guess to and the people are

1664
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:32,480
afraid that the uh all of this uh

1665
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:34,960
auxiliary um stuff is that's going on is

1666
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:38,238
is polluting the vegetables that we're

1667
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,039
eating and the crops and I thought well

1668
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:42,519
this is a wonderful time to ask this

1669
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:44,519
question because I've been uh very

1670
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,199
curious I've always thought the GMO

1671
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,440
approach was great so uh maybe uh

1672
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:56,119
somebody can explain to me why there's

1673
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:57,479
such uh fear and uh desperation about it

1674
01:12:56,119 --> 01:13:00,039
yeah I think you sort of put your your

1675
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:02,079
finger on it there is that the the first

1676
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:05,399
really sort of commercially successful

1677
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:08,000
use of the technology was for herbicide

1678
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:10,158
resistance and that did uh sort of it

1679
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,560
was Associated then with more herbicide

1680
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,679
use which was really effective in the

1681
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,719
field the farmers you know accepted the

1682
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:19,279
the

1683
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:21,399
technology um uh the sort of downside of

1684
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,319
that was that there was then a lot more

1685
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:24,799
regulations that occurred around the

1686
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:26,599
technology and this partly relates to

1687
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,239
the public public concern about it so

1688
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,199
there became more and more regulations

1689
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:32,479
and it actually prevented more

1690
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:34,839
widespread use of the technology it was

1691
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,759
sort of counterintuitive but it became

1692
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,279
so expensive to regulate crops that

1693
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,400
there were very few companies that could

1694
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:43,238
actually do it so you know Monsanto of

1695
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:46,519
course was one of those companies that

1696
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:48,479
were able to uh deploy the technology

1697
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,880
and it sort of uh you know it sort of

1698
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:53,158
stained the the use of the technology I

1699
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,719
think in the in the minds of the public

1700
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:56,960
it just so happened that that was the

1701
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:00,158
the first first use of the technology if

1702
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:02,158
it had been used for you know uh proving

1703
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:05,359
disease resistance or a number of other

1704
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,719
things improving nutrition of crops uh

1705
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:10,079
and there were subsequent uses of it for

1706
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:12,279
those purposes it just uh it might have

1707
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,559
been completely

1708
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:16,759
different actually let me just add to

1709
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:21,440
that I think the other big use

1710
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:22,760
of um GM early on was insect resistance

1711
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,359
in the form of

1712
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,320
BT and the impact globally has been to

1713
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:29,839
reduce the use of pesticides by

1714
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:31,679
somewhere between 20 and 25 and 50%

1715
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,960
depending on the crop in the

1716
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:37,600
region so the use of GM technology has

1717
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,719
actually improved Environmental Quality

1718
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,880
and the lives of many many many many

1719
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:44,960
many millions of farmers around the

1720
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,119
world many small farmers in fact just in

1721
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:51,760
case you don't know the average size of

1722
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:55,359
the farm using BT uh BT cotton today is

1723
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:57,159
less than a hectare of land so there's a

1724
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,158
huge mythology out there that it's only

1725
01:14:57,158 --> 01:15:00,920
the big farmers that benefit it's not

1726
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:02,599
the truth but it is in fact the

1727
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:05,039
mythology and now I think it's so

1728
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,480
confusing in people's minds between the

1729
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:10,158
use of glyphosate and then this

1730
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:12,439
alternative that it's not one and the

1731
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:14,839
same thing and so if you had to somehow

1732
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:17,638
create one monolithic

1733
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,279
understanding it's very confusing

1734
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:22,159
because it's not one thing or the other

1735
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:25,800
it depends where and how and who it's

1736
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:30,198
like any other form of intervention

1737
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:32,039
right too much is not good but we're at

1738
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:34,519
that point where I think it's been very

1739
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:34,519
very very

1740
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:46,000
confusing I think part of the problem is

1741
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,520
that this extends Beyond plants you get

1742
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,800
this Frankenstein element of well we're

1743
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:54,679
introducing different species and mixing

1744
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:58,880
with humans and uh we're modifying DNA

1745
01:15:54,679 --> 01:16:03,880
and so forth and um part of us goes well

1746
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:05,800
beyond um uh the plant uh development to

1747
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,719
concerns about what the limits of

1748
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,239
science are in in areas that directly

1749
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:13,639
relate to

1750
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:16,000
human uh the human uh development and so

1751
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:19,159
forth and uh some of that fear of the

1752
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,198
Frankenstein element is is coming into

1753
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:24,198
um uh the area of plants and vegetables

1754
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:32,439
I mean actually the

1755
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:37,039
technology is applied to all forms of

1756
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:39,879
life but so far we don't apply GM to

1757
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:43,560
human but we do apply it to try to

1758
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:46,079
improve human quality of human life in

1759
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,400
different Arenas including probably most

1760
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:51,119
of the medications you take

1761
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:53,359
today you know we don't chew on the bark

1762
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:56,399
of the willow tree to get our

1763
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:58,158
aspirin uh we don't you know are if any

1764
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:02,079
of you are diabetic and you have to take

1765
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:04,079
insulin it's GM insulin so we forget how

1766
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:07,198
many of the things that we think are

1767
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:09,079
fine are GM technology as well but I

1768
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,319
agree with you that is the confusion and

1769
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:16,079
I think it has implications

1770
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:21,840
for we have a an understanding that life

1771
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:23,039
was natural before GM which is another

1772
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,560
one of

1773
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,560
those bizarre concept cepts that

1774
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:35,800
we've I I have actually two

1775
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,760
questions it seems to me that the known

1776
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:42,039
genetic diversity among all the major

1777
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:45,760
crops and the fact that each of them is

1778
01:17:42,039 --> 01:17:48,238
susceptible to uh different pathogens

1779
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:51,360
that have po

1780
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:54,879
specificity is it possible this is

1781
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:58,319
thinking 10 years from now or 20 to use

1782
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:01,520
that information from one uh main

1783
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:05,719
cultivar like wheat to use genes that

1784
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:09,560
confer resistance to put them into corn

1785
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:11,800
to confer resistance to uh pathogens

1786
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,840
that now can't recognize that because

1787
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,600
the pathogens of corn don't under know

1788
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,480
have never interacted with wheat jeans

1789
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:21,039
or whatever the the products of wheat

1790
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:25,599
jeans I me in a very diverse way it

1791
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:27,719
seems to me uh this understanding of uh

1792
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,360
all the diversity and and then making

1793
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:33,198
use of that in a global way could really

1794
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:36,439
uh arrest some of the problems that we

1795
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:39,839
have with the ability of microbes to to

1796
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:42,238
become adaptable to to now infect the

1797
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,679
resistant cultive our four five six

1798
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:48,519
years down as the way we have with rust

1799
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:51,319
variants and and wheat for

1800
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,080
example yeah in fact it's not even 10

1801
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:55,719
years from now that actually has already

1802
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:58,479
been done so there are examples where a

1803
01:18:55,719 --> 01:19:01,399
gene has been identified in a a mustard

1804
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:03,198
plant and was transferred to tomato

1805
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:06,000
tomato in this case didn't have any

1806
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:07,960
genetic resistance to a certain disease

1807
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,119
uh of course you can't cross a mustard

1808
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:13,239
plant and a tomato plant so they were

1809
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:15,800
able to use GMO technology to move the

1810
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:17,718
gene from mustard to tomato and it gave

1811
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,719
really effective resistance there's

1812
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:21,480
others examples too where it's not been

1813
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:23,000
commercialized right oh no this has not

1814
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:25,158
been commercialized yet but it's being

1815
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,119
tested this happened paper was published

1816
01:19:25,158 --> 01:19:28,679
a couple of years ago and there's many

1817
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:31,359
other examples in the literature of

1818
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:33,960
moving Gene from rice to ma to corn and

1819
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:36,479
so forth so the technology is available

1820
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,480
there again probably the main holdup has

1821
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:41,839
again been the acceptance or lack of

1822
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:44,279
acceptance of GMO technology terrific my

1823
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:47,800
my second question is really directed to

1824
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:51,759
you uh the plants have uh quite good

1825
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:54,719
innate immune mechanisms but not

1826
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:58,320
Acquired and is there any way to

1827
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:00,439
introduce into plants an ability to

1828
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,920
learn from the experience and even

1829
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:05,879
transfer that immunity to the seeds so

1830
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,520
that the Next Generation I mean that you

1831
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,960
know that there's some resistance that

1832
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,679
gets conveyed through the germ plasma

1833
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,719
yeah that's a great question it I mean

1834
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:17,600
we do view plants having an innate

1835
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:20,119
immune system just the way that humans

1836
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,239
do it doesn't rely on antibodies but

1837
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:25,119
humans also have this sort of system

1838
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:26,638
that basically like plants every cell

1839
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:29,760
needs to be able to respond to a

1840
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:32,560
pathogen so in a sense I mean that is

1841
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,520
acquired they they evolve over a longer

1842
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,760
period of time but they plants don't

1843
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,120
have antibodies in the sense of they

1844
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:42,000
meet a entirely new pathogen and acquire

1845
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,000
that and it's passed

1846
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:52,039
on good good afternoon um I'm I'm here

1847
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,239
from San Francisco I work with some of

1848
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:57,639
the big egg Growers and processors

1849
01:20:55,238 --> 01:21:01,198
um and mostly in product development

1850
01:20:57,639 --> 01:21:04,119
post uh Harvest and uh one of the

1851
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,839
frustrations I have is everybody um in

1852
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:08,359
in the the production business and the

1853
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:10,880
marketing business fears getting a label

1854
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:13,880
of oh this is a GMO product and so I'm

1855
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,800
going to go back to to Professor Jon's

1856
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:19,880
first bullet point on on what are the

1857
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,480
the mission and that is to educate and

1858
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:25,039
particularly when it comes to I think

1859
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,919
some of the hysteria about genetic

1860
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:28,840
engineering is a lack of understanding

1861
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:32,199
and so I'm going to throw it to you to

1862
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:37,639
say what are you doing to educate people

1863
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:39,519
the EU last week cleared GMO crops that

1864
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:42,520
there's no Health effect negative health

1865
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,920
effects from this and on the record and

1866
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:46,880
yet they still oppose it they're no uh

1867
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:51,399
they're not allowed to import any GMO

1868
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:56,199
products into to the EU so what would be

1869
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:59,839
what standards would you propose

1870
01:21:56,198 --> 01:22:03,238
to uh demonstrate safety both from a

1871
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:05,400
plant side from a biological side and I

1872
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:07,319
the bigger issue is other health issues

1873
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:09,559
uh but is there a standard that would

1874
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:13,198
meet your criteria and how are you going

1875
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,199
to get get that that standard out

1876
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,039
there thank you for the

1877
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:22,560
[Laughter]

1878
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:25,519
question so I no I mean I think uh you

1879
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,360
hit on a lot of important observations

1880
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,040
right so it it's it certainly is a big

1881
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:33,559
problem in terms of perception of GMOs

1882
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:36,639
and I I'll just start first with one

1883
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:40,199
antidote so I I was at a dinner once in

1884
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,880
France with the head of an inra lab so

1885
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:44,960
this a lab that's kind of the equivalent

1886
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:47,639
of a USDA lab and this was a lab that

1887
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,800
was doing a lot of GM modification this

1888
01:22:47,639 --> 01:22:52,560
was a lab that was promoting the

1889
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:56,480
positive benefits of

1890
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:58,520
GMOs um very aware of the fact uh and

1891
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,079
promoted the fact that there are EU

1892
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,120
studies there's National Academy of

1893
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:05,198
Science studies there's many studies

1894
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:07,198
addressing kind of the inherent risk you

1895
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:09,079
know is there you could probably design

1896
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,359
something sure you could you could

1897
01:23:09,079 --> 01:23:13,039
express uh something that'll cause an

1898
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:15,399
allergy and that would be dangerous but

1899
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:18,600
is there anything inherent about GMO

1900
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:20,559
technology that is dangerous and and

1901
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,360
many have come to the inclusion

1902
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,600
conclusion that that's not the case so

1903
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:28,639
here we are at the dinner

1904
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:31,440
and the wife of the director who is so

1905
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:35,319
positively Pro GMO says I will never

1906
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:38,599
touch anything GMO because I think it's

1907
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:41,198
dangerous so he can't convince his wife

1908
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,440
U so some some people I think are not

1909
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:46,000
going to respond to the logical

1910
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,839
arguments no matter what whether it's

1911
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,399
because you know some of the this is

1912
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,920
food right it's something we put in

1913
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,399
their mouth that's probably the thing

1914
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,800
you're going to be most concerned about

1915
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:58,158
um before everything everything else I

1916
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:00,440
think in the end the best arguments as

1917
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,920
has been mentioned before is going to be

1918
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:05,279
um products and you're in that area

1919
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:07,319
where the consumer appreciates the fact

1920
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:10,319
that it's GM because it's more

1921
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:12,719
nutritious because it has better quality

1922
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:16,039
um I think just right now it just I mean

1923
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,719
I yeah I understand I talk um to to a

1924
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:19,600
lot of the seed companies and yeah they

1925
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:21,079
just don't want to touch it they they

1926
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,480
don't want to be the one to take the

1927
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:27,238
arrows let somebody else do that um

1928
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:29,919
because there is a lot of negative

1929
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:32,000
perception and I'm not sure that it's as

1930
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,960
simple as education there's a lot of

1931
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,960
people you can explain and they have

1932
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,719
other agendas other reasons why they're

1933
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:41,399
not interested in maybe necessarily

1934
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:44,039
following the the logical arguments and

1935
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:46,638
again you know in there not to be too

1936
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:49,880
negative I think again because it is so

1937
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:52,760
basic our food is so basic to us we are

1938
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:54,639
probably the most risk averse with that

1939
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:57,400
more than many other things so that's

1940
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:02,719
people a lot of people have a lot of

1941
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:07,198
concern is stand is way to

1942
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:10,079
come yeah biolog I I think I I can't

1943
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,919
really address that question but I think

1944
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,439
Susan alluded to it'll be really

1945
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:17,440
interesting to see how people respond to

1946
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:20,158
the editing technology where it's very

1947
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:21,960
you know that we use mutation breeding

1948
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:23,638
all the time natural variation all the

1949
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,639
time these are going to be changes that

1950
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:29,199
will be EXA exactly the same as what you

1951
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:31,679
would get through natural variation are

1952
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,839
people going to respond to those as okay

1953
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:37,960
yeah that's fine are they still going to

1954
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,760
say you intervened so therefore it

1955
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,198
doesn't meet my standard of what I

1956
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,760
accept and it it's true again you know I

1957
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:46,399
was you'd never see anything you see

1958
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,880
practically growing in the supermarket

1959
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:50,359
in the wild right it's all the product

1960
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:54,000
of

1961
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:56,000
manipulation but in the end the reality

1962
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,639
still is a lot of

1963
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:04,439
people don't want it my answer is label

1964
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:06,960
it label it GM now we should have done

1965
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:09,439
it at the very beginning we pasteurized

1966
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:13,118
milk people hated it at the beginning we

1967
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:14,678
labeled it it's fine but you don't label

1968
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:17,000
it it looks like you're trying to hide

1969
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:18,840
something you people don't believe you

1970
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,479
because they you don't tell them the

1971
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:23,760
truth tell them the truth it's GM

1972
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:25,519
they'll get over it they'll try it I

1973
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:28,159
don't think it's I wish we would just

1974
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,080
label it I I I would stop everything

1975
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:33,960
else and just put the label

1976
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:36,840
on that's my answer we have time for one

1977
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:39,679
more question so you were speaking

1978
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:42,360
earlier uh about some of the issues with

1979
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,800
the zika virus and malaria that's

1980
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:48,920
resistant to a lot of antibiotics and

1981
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:52,000
Other Drugs um as sort of a way that uh

1982
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:54,719
um something that unifies people behind

1983
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,560
uh some of the genetic modification um

1984
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,198
but I was kind of curious about uh

1985
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:02,639
something such as golden rice where we

1986
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:07,599
see like widespread beneficial impact of

1987
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:09,679
of this uh possible um variety of rice

1988
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,920
and uh you still see a lot of groups

1989
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:16,239
such as Green Piece uh like vly uh

1990
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:18,359
against these sorts of things so uh in

1991
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:21,399
the problem of like kind of implementing

1992
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:23,679
these uh this technology um are we

1993
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:25,759
looking at like a vocal minority that

1994
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,199
that we need to like out Lobby or

1995
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:32,440
something like that is this an issue I

1996
01:27:28,198 --> 01:27:37,799
think maybe about um universities not

1997
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:41,559
being able to uh go to governments or or

1998
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,920
consumers with information as readily as

1999
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:45,639
uh organizations that you know aren't

2000
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,960
governed in the same way that we are so

2001
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:50,199
I'm kind of curious like how do you see

2002
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,840
us changing the minds of not just

2003
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:55,638
consumers who I think are probably a

2004
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:58,239
little bit uh easier to reach but but

2005
01:27:55,639 --> 01:28:02,600
the people who are really like affecting

2006
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:06,198
change policy wise on these

2007
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:08,880
issues I want to I want to just say

2008
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:10,879
um it sounds like you think golden rice

2009
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,279
is a

2010
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:17,159
product no no no no you know it's never

2011
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:19,960
it's there is no golden rice you know

2012
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:22,158
that right it doesn't exist as a product

2013
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,719
on the market it nobody is eating golden

2014
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:30,198
rice anywhere in the world right yeah

2015
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:30,198
okay so why hasn't it gone out you mean

2016
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:35,679
yeah many reasons probably I mean I know

2017
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,440
some reasons but I think

2018
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,880
you're my my

2019
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:44,198
my my thought is that there's been a lot

2020
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:46,279
of attempt on the part of many people on

2021
01:28:44,198 --> 01:28:49,599
all sides of this argument on all sides

2022
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:53,198
of the fence to reach policy makers and

2023
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:56,119
to discuss at in a logical scientific

2024
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:58,479
way and I actually agree with Jim I

2025
01:28:56,118 --> 01:29:01,479
think the fundamental reason that the

2026
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:05,479
scientific arguments The Logical the

2027
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:08,158
rational don't necessarily convince is

2028
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:10,839
because the objections are

2029
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:13,839
not uh logical rational or

2030
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:16,679
scientifically based so you cannot

2031
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:19,239
counteract them with those kinds of

2032
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:22,679
arguments I have I I have an

2033
01:29:19,238 --> 01:29:22,678
understanding that actually

2034
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,479
many I don't know if this is true but I

2035
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:30,118
think many

2036
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:31,959
um having talked to many people I think

2037
01:29:30,118 --> 01:29:35,920
many people have a deep-seated

2038
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:37,679
understanding that uh comes from judeo

2039
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:41,639
Christian

2040
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:43,600
beliefs that the world was made in God's

2041
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:46,279
image and

2042
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:50,280
any changes

2043
01:29:46,279 --> 01:29:53,000
are against the law of

2044
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:54,960
God and that's why I think evolution is

2045
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,399
not taught in some some

2046
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:01,679
schools it's the same fundamental Clash

2047
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:04,039
of some very very very basic belief

2048
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:07,440
systems it's not reachable by science or

2049
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:09,479
by Logic so I I actually believe that

2050
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:11,638
that's underlying a lot of the

2051
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:14,238
resistance and it's not something that a

2052
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:17,440
policy maker can change it's not

2053
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:19,759
something a university class can change

2054
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:24,638
it's something that

2055
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:26,440
people um maybe the reason people change

2056
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:27,920
is because they're confronted by a

2057
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:30,559
greater

2058
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,840
evil and it forces them to reconsider

2059
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,400
their belief systems sometimes but as

2060
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,520
long as you can hold on to your belief

2061
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:39,519
system I know there's a fundamental deep

2062
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:42,560
deep seated belief system that probably

2063
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:45,560
each of us has we will defend it to the

2064
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:48,520
death and I think that's the at that's

2065
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:50,840
actually where you know when cernus or

2066
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:53,600
any of the the great discoveries in

2067
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,760
science that that the Earth revolves

2068
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,039
around the sun things don't revolve

2069
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,840
around us anything that takes us out of

2070
01:30:58,039 --> 01:31:03,000
the center is somehow very threatening

2071
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,400
so I actually believe it's at that level

2072
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:09,800
and that's

2073
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,799
why um it it doesn't follow a linear

2074
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:16,719
course it never disappoints me when I

2075
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,920
hear conversations among cornellians

2076
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:22,158
this was a fabulous session this

2077
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,279
afternoon I thank each and every one of

2078
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:27,359
you for joining us for this thoughtful

2079
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:31,359
conversation and please join me in

2080
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:31,359
appreciating our panelists this

2081
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:44,560
afternoon this has been a production of
