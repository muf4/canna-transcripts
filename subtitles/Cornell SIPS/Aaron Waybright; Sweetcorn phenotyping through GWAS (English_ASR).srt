1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,240
our next presenter is Aaron we break my

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,339
Aaron's from Gettysburg Pennsylvania and

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,019
he was mentored on this project by Mike

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,939
Gore with healthcare undergraduate James

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:24,778
Chalmers and after graduation he plans

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:29,160
to an intern at civic mix with us the

9
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:31,259
seminar title is filled in affecting 3G

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,759
once again my name is Aaron way bright I

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,719
am a senior plant science major

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,500
graduating this in a few weeks now and

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,378
concentrating in plant breeding and

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,960
genetics so the project I was working on

15
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:47,728
with the gore lab yep I took I got

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,558
inspired to just work in the gore lab by

17
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:51,658
taking Michael Gord octor Michael Gore's

18
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,919
class nutritional quality improvement of

19
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:58,048
field crops most of my exposure to clamp

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,900
reading thus far had been to maximize

21
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:02,759
traits that maximize yield and the

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,349
approach they were taking was to work on

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,259
traits that increase the nutritional

24
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,118
quality of it so it's kind of difficult

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,710
because they're not as easily quantified

26
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,328
but ultimately they're resulting in

27
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,759
higher quality crops which i think is

28
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:17,399
something that's very important so I

29
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,920
signed on for it as a field assistant

30
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:21,750
the following the following summer and

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,700
stayed on with the lab to continue

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,228
working with the data I collected over

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,240
the summer in a fall research project so

34
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,640
most of the work was done at Aurora

35
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,489
where a member of the gore lab Matmos a

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,858
geo PhD student is working on a breeding

37
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,810
project this was the third year of the

38
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:42,809
breeding project to increase vitamin A

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,649
and E content and sweet corn adapted for

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,570
the New York environment so I was

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,829
spending most of the time working on

42
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,868
that a little bit of time working with

43
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,459
the field corn for another project but I

44
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,039
was gaining a lot of exposure to

45
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,530
phenotyping tools so as breeding

46
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,450
projects become you know more expansive

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,210
and as the technology really increases a

48
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,889
lot we had the capability to collect

49
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,509
simply a ton of data now which key no

50
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:08,460
can only can only lead to better results

51
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,740
so I spent the majority of my time

52
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,719
working with this phenotyping we had a

53
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,879
mobile field book app which was you know

54
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,949
a little just a smartphone app and we

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,780
had barcodes and scanners we were using

56
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:21,780
to collect our phenotypic data

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,280
so this was a really made it much easier

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,319
back that than back to the days when you

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,539
had to you know use your ruler and write

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,789
down your measurements so we took things

61
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,699
such as flowering time plant height ear

62
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:34,859
height node council etc plant height is

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,939
the trait that most relevant to the rest

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,420
of this talk so we've collected all of

65
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,099
this data over the summer and I was

66
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,708
still really interested in I asked stay

67
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,299
one in the fall to work with this data

68
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,789
to help me involved in this breeding

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,219
project and I was advised by James

70
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:56,269
Hammes someone who recently graduated

71
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,830
was also working in the gore lab I

72
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,689
wasn't I've been learning a lot about

73
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,550
genetics in school but I was finding now

74
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,650
that at the aforementioned large big

75
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,570
datasets I really had to learn a lot

76
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,950
about computers so James was very

77
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:10,439
invaluable in this and I was

78
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:13,469
particularly relevant for organizing the

79
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,289
data after I had the data organized I

80
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,509
had to perform calculations which I will

81
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:21,000
we'll get more into later and then the

82
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:26,069
final ultimate step G loss here which I

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,409
will also explain in more detail so this

84
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,139
here is an example of what the data kind

85
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,629
of looks like after it's coming through

86
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,399
the mobile field book app so it's just

87
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,590
kind of who collected this data some

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,709
some metadata is in the metadata is the

89
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,019
data about the data so like this is when

90
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,330
it was collected the trait and then you

91
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,310
kind of got this here the barcode number

92
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,500
for the plant and the other relevance

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,819
here the relevant measurements as you

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,180
can tell it's kind of messy it's not a

95
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,159
not really particularly useful not not

96
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,650
easily easily analyzed for for a

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,019
breeding project so this was the end

98
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,060
result took me took me a lot of time to

99
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,319
learn computer programming to process

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,689
all of this instead of sorting it by

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,289
hand so you know this is nice and

102
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,430
organized we've got the field terms here

103
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:15,689
you know and then then the height

104
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,340
measurement there so I did most of this

105
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,738
through Python which was actually pretty

106
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,689
easily accessible I learned a lot of it

107
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,639
through the C yet computer science notes

108
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,079
I never took the course but all the

109
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,300
notes are freely available through the

110
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,659
glass so that was definitely a big help

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,860
and I learned a lot of computer skills

112
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,200
here you know how to

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,509
process these these large large data

114
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,879
sets that you could what take you years

115
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:42,930
and years and then a two months too much

116
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,759
time to process by hand so one thing I

117
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,709
really encountered and this is something

118
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,099
that I really learned a lot about in in

119
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:52,469
a field trial here so oftentimes the

120
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,110
data is not perfect so right here one of

121
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,030
the example was a you know should be

122
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,310
obvious to large just like just okay is

123
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,219
that data good wrong tool use that's

124
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,930
concerning bar code was upside down also

125
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,880
concerning so I had to go back through

126
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,069
and check to make sure that this data

127
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:12,629
was actually usable and then you know

128
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:14,759
adding the the necessary Corrections so

129
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:16,560
the next step after all the data was in

130
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,800
an organized will form was to perform

131
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,480
Bluff calculations so the sweet corn

132
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,250
diversity panel we had planted out a

133
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,080
bunch of different genotypes to see how

134
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,519
they perform in the New York environment

135
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,870
then you know we could choose from those

136
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,870
for the breeding program as it

137
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,910
progresses but a field trials there they

138
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,800
got a lot going on so like one portion

139
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,290
of the field was like just riddled with

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,490
corn rootworm if you guys remember over

141
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,160
the summer there was a really big

142
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,350
drought so like it's not these perfect

143
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,380
numbers the perfect values for what the

144
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,660
value of this plants genotype so the

145
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,399
bluff calculation uses a mixed model so

146
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,340
multiple variables considers multiple

147
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,079
variables in terms to get a standardized

148
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,169
value so like it takes in all this field

149
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:01,349
terms I mentioned and kind of it kind of

150
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,370
works that out so it uh it makes a blob

151
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,140
stands for best linear unbiased

152
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,120
prediction so like you know if we can

153
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,639
remove the biases from like the drought

154
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,990
and from the corn rootworm hopefully we

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,879
can get the true value of this genotype

156
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,210
and then we can actually consider it for

157
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,279
the breeding program the bluff wrapper

158
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:20,339
which is a program we used in our

159
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,109
statistical analysis software considers

160
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,819
all of these terms for significance and

161
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,770
decides to see which ones are impacting

162
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,810
it and then adjust the value that the

163
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:31,529
that the bluff value for that genotype

164
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,439
accordingly and then the REM will is

165
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:37,619
also part of this to reach this this

166
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,079
true value it gives so to understand it

167
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,480
puts weights on like field terms like

168
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,800
the the field organizational statistics

169
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,370
or the field yet

170
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,168
and gives you like the necessary weights

171
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,668
to give it true a true value of what

172
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:55,439
your what the genotypes you're

173
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:56,818
considering so after we had I kind of

174
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,439
got a good grasp on this we were going

175
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,939
to do some height trait analysis this

176
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,370
was we chose this because it was my

177
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,709
first time working working with this

178
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,300
type of bioinformatics process so this

179
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:09,388
is to be a pretty straightforward trait

180
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,460
you know wouldn't wouldn't be would it

181
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,370
be too too difficult to assess so we

182
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,258
decided to move forward with that so I

183
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:22,348
had to learn a little bit more computer

184
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:25,680
skills to process this data so here is

185
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:27,990
is the result of the blocks so this

186
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,408
straight line here would be like you

187
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,870
know a truly a truly standardized line

188
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:36,598
these little dots here are the genotype

189
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,699
values so if it was a perfect fit all of

190
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,718
the little dots will be on the line that

191
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,550
is you can see we've got some trailing

192
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,829
off here at the top and trailing off at

193
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,598
the bottom meaning that even you know

194
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,978
even with the all the statistical

195
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,990
information we put in there we were

196
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,939
still not able to get good values for

197
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,658
these genotypes good estimates of what

198
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:57,209
their Worth was but fortunately because

199
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:59,009
I came in later after three years of the

200
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:02,399
breeding project existing I was able to

201
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:05,968
draw upon 2014 and 2015 data to to

202
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,908
bolster the strength to this analysis so

203
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:10,620
here are the model terms so like you

204
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:12,209
know genotype year super these those are

205
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,769
filled terms and the program considers

206
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:15,568
those you know two feet to see which

207
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,038
ones are impacting it and we got a much

208
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,229
better fit here a little bit of trailing

209
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,329
off but that's expected so we could we

210
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:23,399
could a we could work with these values

211
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,990
so now we had a good understanding of

212
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,620
what these each one of these genotypes

213
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,288
was words so now we decided to move on

214
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,810
to Jia Jia stands for genomic wide

215
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:35,098
Association study so all the genotypes

216
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,649
we were working with are you know pretty

217
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,770
well studies pretty well mapped plenty

218
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,450
of snips which are single nucleotide

219
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,059
polymorphisms which represent like a

220
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,839
known location in a genome that yeah we

221
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,969
can scan for and tag that very quickly

222
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,600
so we were testing for the relevancy of

223
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,190
these snips for plant height so

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,528
you know a bunch of the really tall

225
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,690
plants had all had the same snips like

226
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:02,689
it seems like likely that those nips are

227
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,350
linked genes that are influencing plant

228
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,079
height so we tested the stiffs relevant

229
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,050
to here each blue dot their counselor

230
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:15,349
the snip and if they were high above the

231
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:16,969
red line that indicates relevancy and as

232
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,610
you see this was kind of surprising most

233
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,399
of them were high above the red line but

234
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,199
because most modern maize breeding is do

235
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,299
you cross these lines back and forth

236
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:28,519
there's a lot of relatedness which could

237
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:32,299
make snips seem more relevant than they

238
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:35,089
actually are so we connect corrected for

239
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:37,309
this kinship and we got this resulting

240
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,259
graph and all the snips here are right

241
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:41,568
along the blue line are right along the

242
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:44,120
red line which which actually indicates

243
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:46,759
that there were no significant no

244
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,240
significant snips in influencing plant

245
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,490
height this is a Manhattan plot each one

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,068
of these different colored portions is a

247
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,289
chromosome and the height of the dot

248
00:09:55,068 --> 00:10:00,019
height of the snip indicates the

249
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:02,120
relevancy of this to plant height and

250
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:05,919
they would have to be much higher for

251
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,179
for a relevant result or a relevant hit

252
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,338
so this was kind of disappointing but

253
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:12,409
ultimately not super surprising because

254
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,600
plant height is a very quantitative

255
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:17,208
trait meaning that there are many many

256
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,120
many small genes each influencing the

257
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:22,338
ultimate result of the plant height so

258
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,709
we were not able to identify any

259
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,639
particular genes that were having a

260
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:30,078
major impact so once again no

261
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,180
significant results which was kind of

262
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,429
disappointing but gave me a big a big a

263
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,198
nice look into how science is done and

264
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:39,198
this is how oftentimes the results of

265
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:41,019
these projects so I got a real real feel

266
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:43,219
for how is how what's this got going on

267
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,980
but it was really good for me to gain

268
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,778
experience and you know in how a

269
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,240
breeding project is actually conducted

270
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:52,309
like I can only you know don't we get

271
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,079
such a feel for it from from learning

272
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:55,758
through the classroom like the field

273
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,179
study was definitely surprised we really

274
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,169
had to encounter a lot of a lot of

275
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:01,849
obstacles and things that would change

276
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:03,649
our data and keep it from being like the

277
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,720
perfect green house trial experiment

278
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,600
that's obviously not achievable in a few

279
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,980
study the data organization I think was

280
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,409
really important to learn because

281
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,970
computer programming and big data big

282
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,948
bioinformatics is only going to be more

283
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,410
relevant in the breeding field moving

284
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:20,508
forward and I was able to be involved in

285
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:22,909
this analysis which is which was a you

286
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:25,039
know helping to decide the value of

287
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:26,899
these genotypes and I look forward to

288
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,750
learning more about possibly into grad

289
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,519
school how to select from that analysis

290
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,458
what what genotypes you want to work

291
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,009
with moving forward and yeah

292
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,778
bioinformatics very important I like to

293
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,000
give acknowledgments to these members of

294
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,528
the gore lab dr. Michael Gore for taking

295
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,559
me on and giving you the opportunity to

296
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:47,059
work in his lab with his with his

297
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,068
facilities James Chambliss for advising

298
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:51,979
me throughout the project Nick asmar the

299
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:53,299
lab advisor for also continuing to

300
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,850
supply a lot of advice and helping me

301
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:58,068
work through problems map pistachio this

302
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,189
was his project after all so of course

303
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:02,719
after thank him and dr. LD Quezada for

304
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:14,208
providing the bluff wrapper for the

305
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:18,110
statistical analysis any questions I was

306
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:24,588
unclear what made the analysis by Olivia

307
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:28,250
model this is the overview talking this

308
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:35,959
one here okay so whatever you're shown

309
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:38,740
the model goes a couple of this here huh

310
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,479
the otherwise with this so you set it up

311
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:48,049
copy on BIOS prediction what makes it on

312
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:53,240
by if I'm not clear so ok so if we

313
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:54,828
planted the planted the genotypes it's

314
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,350
not a normal linear model because it's

315
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:59,269
considering multiple factors here like

316
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,550
the fixed effects and the random effects

317
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:06,500
so that is what make it a different than

318
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:08,859
a linear model if I'm answering your

319
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,860
question

320
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:15,389
so I would understand - in figures you

321
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:17,579
have a decimal in your position and you

322
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:21,600
have a sesame on five addition some

323
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,789
could ask what my connection is

324
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,298
definitely on five that makes that would

325
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:28,349
I buy it

326
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:30,538
Shilla oh yeah so the the unbiased

327
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,939
portion takes out the the field study

328
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:35,038
bias so for example part of the field

329
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:37,858
that we planted out and had a corn worm

330
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:39,448
corn rootworm and if we were to not

331
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,249
correct for that we would just think

332
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:43,469
there's genotypes for crap when really

333
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:45,329
they might be valuable but uh they just

334
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,668
had the unfortunate luck of being

335
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:49,678
planted in a blighted portion of the

336
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:53,278
field so this helps to correct for that

337
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:54,928
some of them block yeah it utilizes the

338
00:13:53,278 --> 00:14:00,028
field blocking the utilizes of the field

339
00:13:54,928 --> 00:14:06,988
blocking terms you go about two more

340
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:09,239
slides forward again sure thing so can

341
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:11,189
you explain to what the basis of that is

342
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:16,100
and how we do the corrections just tell

343
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:19,048
me about steamships it was okay yeah so

344
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,720
because a lot of these genotypes had

345
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:23,308
been you know had lineages exchanged and

346
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,129
they're in their history and the arrival

347
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:27,928
to this final product they are all

348
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,058
related to some degree and we're all

349
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:33,149
sharing some of the snips to some degree

350
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:35,850
and so this was making snips seem more

351
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:38,369
relevant than they actually were so we

352
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,159
included a kinship matrix which helps

353
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:43,980
tone down the relevancy based on how

354
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:49,230
related the two genotypes the genotypes

355
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:53,668
were to each other the diversity and

356
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,819
supposed to a limited extent another to

357
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:55,818
know

358
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:03,759
I'm shocked if there's that much

359
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,070
relationship so because we were were

360
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,319
planting out maize lines we planted out

361
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,028
maize lines that were expected to grow

362
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,760
you know fairly well in this climate

363
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:15,669
that so that you know those types of

364
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:19,028
made lines probably had similar similar

365
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:20,229
backgrounds and ancestry to result you

366
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:22,889
know and it's the same climate

367
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,889
adaptiveness

368
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:40,399
yeah good one that was fun I wouldn't be

369
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,600
a normally distributed or not what

370
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,029
relevance does that have to do with

371
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,440
whether models accurate are just a

372
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:50,629
little bit unclear okay so we didn't

373
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,820
expect any of these genius types to be

374
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:54,620
like rockstars like we they were all

375
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,810
kind of similar so like if one of them

376
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,879
was suddenly so much better than all of

377
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,069
the other ones like that would be an

378
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:05,720
issue so we wanted a nice distribution

379
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:08,960
of seeing how they perform so which

380
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,129
which was was the straight line there

381
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:15,680
and so like after after we correct

382
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:18,070
unbiased the the results we were able to

383
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:26,089
get a nice distribution along that line

384
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:28,190
that's if I'm answering a question this

385
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:33,940
has been a production of Cornell

386
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,940
