1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,638
University all right well thank you all

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,960
for coming and thank you for inviting me

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,399
um this is my second trip to Cornell I

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,920
gave a seminar in Hort the old Hort

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,599
Department I guess about 10 12 years ago

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,080
and I can't remember for the life of me

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,160
what it was on so hopefully it wasn't on

9
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,518
this but um what I'd like to do today is

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
talk about uh some of our work on co2

11
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,759
concentrating mechanisms in higher

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,679
plants and I'll give a bit on the uh C4

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,640
Evolution story and some of the facets

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,960
that we've been doing with that and then

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,480
I also want to talk about some

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,719
interesting things we've observed that

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,519
are going on in C3 plants to give you a

18
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,079
sense that they're much more Dynamic

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,239
than we thought in terms of how they

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,799
manage photorespiration and deal with

21
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,320
the problems that causes uh and in some

22
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:58,280
ways take advantage of it so with that

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,759
I'll get started and uh this is an old

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,079
graph that uh Ed tolber put together

25
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:07,200
from some years ago um it's the bicycle

26
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,359
diagram that shows C3 photosynthesis and

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,159
photorespiration and it's useful because

28
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
it sort of gives a highlight of the

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,600
start of our problem which is the

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,400
photorespiratory

31
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,438
uh the photorespiratory challenge that

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,759
plants face so as you're all aware CO2

33
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,719
here gets taken up by rabisco and bound

34
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,920
to rubp and carboxy to produce two pgaas

35
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,319
and then using energy in the form of ATP

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,240
and nadph they're made into sugars and

37
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,478
some are regenerated back into rubp to

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,239
maintain the photosynthetic carbon

39
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,599
reduction cycle but in atmospheres of

40
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,478
low CO2 like we've had in recent uh

41
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,759
Millennia oxygen can be taken up by

42
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:53,478
rabisco and bound to rubp in the rubp

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,840
oxygenation reaction and this produces

44
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:59,118
one PG and one one PGA and one two

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,359
carbon molecule called phosphoglycolate

46
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,640
shown there as PG now the

47
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,640
phosphoglycolate has no known use to the

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,920
plant and if it accumulates it's toxic

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,878
so the plant has to deal with it and

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,318
using energy they metabolize it back to

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,318
PGA but in the process lose previously

52
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,799
fixed CO2 which is uh a bit of a waste

53
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:22,359
and because oxygen is taken up and CO2

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,800
is given off this is called

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,560
photorespiration now photorespiration

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,480
has a strong environmental dependency in

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,360
that worm temperatures and Rising

58
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,679
CO2 uh influence the rate at which it

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,879
occurs if you're at high

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,159
CO2 the CO2 suppresses the oxygenase

61
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,679
reaction and

62
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,639
photorespiration relative to

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,599
photosynthesis here is quite low even at

64
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,878
higher

65
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,560
temperatures temperature promotes

66
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,959
photorespiration by uh promoting the

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,199
oxygenase over the carboxy reaction and

68
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,680
if you look at current CO2 levels which

69
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,238
are uh now 400 PPM but correspondingly

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
in the chloroplast they would be here

71
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,158
where these circles are as temperature

72
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,719
rises photorespiration can rise to quite

73
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,479
high levels as you see out here and if

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,080
you close the stomates as you would do

75
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,158
on a hot dry condition you can have

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,200
photorespiration rates that can become

77
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:18,679
exceedingly high and potentially

78
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,280
exceedingly

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,480
inhibitory now to deal with

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,280
this uh well so this just shows the

81
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,158
result of photorespiration on net

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,239
photosyn is here we have temperature

83
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:37,079
going up and at current atmospheric

84
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,360
levels or at least a few years ago and

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,680
21% oxygen a typical C3 photosynthetic

86
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,239
response would be this with a big drop

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,640
off at higher

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,039
temperatures uh but if you reduce

89
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,000
photorespiration by going to 2% oxygen

90
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,000
or high CO2 then you can see the impact

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,799
of photorespiration by comparing the

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,120
differences in rates and you see that at

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,879
high temperatures this difference

94
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,360
between a photoes Iration free and a

95
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,318
photorespiration inhibited C3 plant are

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,640
quite large not such a problem at low

97
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,719
temperatures now because of this strong

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,119
inhibition it's been understood for

99
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,919
years that carbon concentrating

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,560
mechanisms have evolved to deal with the

101
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,400
problem um

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,079
and uh the carbon concentrating

103
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,120
mechanisms that would have evolved

104
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,038
typically came up in dry environments

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,879
here where much of the C3 Flora has been

106
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:33,560
inhibited by the photo respiration

107
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,800
reaction due to the heat of a desert Aid

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,519
place like this as well as to stomatal

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,199
closure to save water in these

110
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,839
conditions which reduces CO2 around the

111
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,919
chloroplast photorespiration is also a

112
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,959
serious problem for much of the C3 Flora

113
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,079
in places like the tropical rainforest

114
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,079
where high temperatures that you would

115
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,639
often encounter uh would lead to

116
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,439
substantial oxygenase

117
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,280
activities now the most famous of the

118
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,038
carbon concentrating mechanisms that

119
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,918
have evolved is of course C4

120
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,478
photosynthesis because a number of C4

121
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,079
plants are important for our food supply

122
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,758
and collectively it provides about a

123
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,478
quarter of the total terrestrial primary

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
productivity on the planet just a quick

125
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,758
review C4 photosynthesis has occurred

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,439
when the reactions of the rabisco and

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
the C3 metabolic cycle are

128
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,000
compartmentalized into the bundle

129
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,000
sheath uh and no longer expressed in the

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,160
misail tissue and instead in the misail

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,839
you've had the upregulation of the C4

132
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,160
metabolic cycle which begins when pep

133
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,198
carboxylase takes pep carboxilate it to

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
a four carbon acid

135
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,000
oxaloacetate which is then reduced to

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,639
melate in the most common form of C4

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,680
that travels to the bundle sheath where

138
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,120
a decarboxylating enzyme NAD mic enzyme

139
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,759
acts upon it to release CO2 produce

140
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,720
nadph and then also create a three

141
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:05,639
carbon residue pyate that has to go back

142
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,840
and with energy be re phosphorated to

143
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,400
pep so with each turn of this cycle CO2

144
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,478
gets pumped into this bundle sheath

145
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,839
where Risco is localized raising CO2 to

146
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,879
levels that suppress

147
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,359
photorespiration now uh a key thing I

148
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,000
just want to emphasize here is that

149
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,120
energy is required to drive this cycle

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,399
so we can think of this as an actively

151
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,879
driven energy dependent carbon

152
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,279
concentrating mechanism

153
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,399
two other well-known carbon

154
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,399
concentrating mechanisms are cam

155
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:41,000
photosynthesis which uh you see here

156
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,000
which is basically the C4 type system

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,959
only instead of spatially separated

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,918
between a misail and bundle sheath it's

159
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,918
temporally separated between day and

160
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:53,959
night at night the stomates open CO2

161
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,758
comes in is carboxilate by pep C to OAA

162
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,279
which is reduced mate that's stored in

163
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,240
the vacu during the day the stomates

164
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:05,079
close creating a diff use of barrier the

165
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,000
melee is released decarbox releasing CO2

166
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,719
which builds up to

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,360
um uh suppressed photorespiration at the

168
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,039
rubisco site in a different group the

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,960
algae mini algae of all a wide variety

170
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:24,120
of forms you've had the evolution of a

171
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,478
bicarbonate pump typically where an atpa

172
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,360
pumps protons out and in a code

173
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,878
transport mechanism they bring

174
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,120
bicarbonate

175
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,560
in and then in a specialized compartment

176
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,439
in the chloroplast called the pyranoid

177
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,360
and UK carots and the carboxysome and

178
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,560
pro carots Carbonic and hydrates

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,800
converts the bicarbonate to CO2 which

180
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,319
then builds up to high concentrations

181
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,400
around rabisco and suppress

182
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,800
photorespiration now again I want to

183
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,439
just emphasize ATP is needed here so

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,240
this bicarbonate pump is an actively

185
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,360
driven CCM and then the rebuilding of

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,720
the carbohydrate pool that will provide

187
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,158
the pep at night ATP is needed so the

188
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,639
cam system can be considered an active

189
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:14,959
pump

190
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,079
so in these active CO2 concentrating

191
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,799
mechanisms you need the energy to

192
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,758
concentrate the CO2 the rabisco is

193
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,439
localized to a CO2 enriched enriched

194
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,680
region and you have a resistive barrier

195
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,839
to slow the efux of CO2 and the C4 the

196
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,360
resistive barrier is the bundle sheath

197
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:39,079
wall um in the cam it's the whole uh

198
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,800
epidermis with closed stomates and then

199
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,080
in the algae It's a combination of a

200
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:49,319
water layer and the pyranoid or

201
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,600
carboxysome uh boundary so again there's

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,200
the examples of these active

203
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,759
systems

204
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,440
and as you probably would as I've

205
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,240
mentioned raising the CO2 through this

206
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,160
pumping mechanism reduces

207
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,639
photorespiration it doesn't get rid of

208
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,199
it but it reduces it down to a few

209
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,039
percentage points of photosynthesis a

210
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,000
second key thing of these CCMS is that

211
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:18,599
by raising CO2 up to these high levels

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,120
they overcome a SAT a substate substrate

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,839
saturation of rabisco that's present in

214
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,959
the current environment so here we have

215
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,839
the carox capacity corrected for

216
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:32,159
photorespiration here we would say I

217
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,640
have a curve at 30° this is just a

218
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,719
rubisco substrate response to CO2 here's

219
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,000
the current CO2 level which you can see

220
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,519
leads to substantial substrate

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,399
limitation and then if you raise the CO2

222
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:50,159
level to what you have in a C4 or a

223
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,240
pyranoid then you begin to approach CO2

224
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,639
saturation so in a low CO2 environment

225
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,879
this is a substantial benefit that

226
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,319
plants would have with active

227
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:04,000
CCMS now there 's a lot of interest

228
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,160
these days in how when and why active

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,159
CCMS have evolved and with C4 we've been

230
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:14,199
working on this um a bit in the last 15

231
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:18,399
years I got on to this when I edited a

232
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,000
book C4 plant biology in the late 1990s

233
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,078
and uh a nice thing about editing

234
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,559
books is you find out how well the field

235
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,519
is really understood and with respect to

236
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,799
C4 I found out that when it came to

237
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,759
evolutionary questions things were

238
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,639
pretty

239
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,838
rudimentary so sort of a

240
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,639
state-of-the-art at that time we thought

241
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,600
there were 25 independent lineages we

242
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,799
knew they all occurred in advanced

243
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,519
angiosperms there was speculation that

244
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:49,838
C4 was maybe 10 million years old the F

245
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,600
genetic understanding was pretty poor um

246
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,639
and we knew there were a number of

247
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,320
species that had traits that were

248
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,079
intermediate between full C4 and full C3

249
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,160
type species

250
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,120
this philogyny that Toby Kellog

251
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,600
published in the book in her chapter

252
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:11,200
sort of summarizes it uh here we have a

253
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,399
philogyny of the Carol fil class kopil

254
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,560
and if we just look at amaranthus here

255
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,919
which is a group known to have some C4

256
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,199
species you can see that it's not well

257
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:24,399
distinguished from other group species

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,079
within the amaran kopia alliance uh we

259
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
didn't know whether there were C3

260
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,519
species here because it hadn't been

261
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,078
fully surveyed and we didn't know

262
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,560
whether there were sister groups that

263
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,679
might have intermediacy and this would

264
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:40,479
be true of most of the clades where we

265
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,719
could find um C4 species being

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,839
abundant and so we really couldn't

267
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
address evolutionary issues because of

268
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,440
the rudimentary state of the flyo

269
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,638
genetics due to low species coverage due

270
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,920
to an inability to know who were C3 and

271
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:58,360
who were C4 and then also poor

272
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,919
resolution so beginning spurred on by

273
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,680
this from the uh

274
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,639
editing job I did on that book um my

275
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,439
co-workers and I here's Tammy Sage one

276
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,959
of my co-workers uh we went to various

277
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,120
herbaria around the world Q New York

278
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,278
Botanical Gardens Missouri Botanical

279
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,480
Gardens and we went to the this uh

280
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,039
herbarium specimens in these clades

281
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,240
where we knew C4 occurred took little

282
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,639
pieces of samples and measured the

283
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,399
carbon isotope ratios uh

284
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,959
which uh are easily distinguished

285
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:38,519
between C3 and C4 so C4s have a carbon

286
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:41,518
isotope ratio of -8 to -6 c3s orus 20 to

287
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,679
minus 32 easily determined with a mass

288
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,919
spec at about $5 an assay so we could do

289
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:50,838
thousands of assays and so we did

290
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:53,198
thousands of assays on many plant groups

291
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,920
and then we teamed up with philogynist

292
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,240
from around the world working on these

293
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,278
groups Thomas bourch for example with

294
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,039
the amaranth

295
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,439
and we were able to get them to get

296
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,439
provide more detailed analytical

297
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,480
philogenetic assessments of the groups

298
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,120
we were interested in and then we mapped

299
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,720
C3 and C4 onto these philogynes and so

300
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,519
here's just the

301
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,839
amaran and by doing this having a more

302
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,560
detailed phogy because we had something

303
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,279
to bring to the table which is the

304
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:27,719
Isotopes we then mapped it on and in the

305
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:30,439
amaran you can see cleanly there's five

306
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,600
distinct origins of C four uh in

307
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,000
amaranthus in irva small one in tioma a

308
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,278
smallish one in alternanthera and then a

309
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,639
relatively large one in what we call the

310
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,639
gids a five generic group uh Gina and

311
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,278
its

312
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,720
allies and now we could go and to these

313
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:54,799
Branch points and ask what's going on

314
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,000
here uh do we have intermediate species

315
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,519
and can we put that intermediacy in a

316
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,159
philogenetic context

317
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,278
okay here's one that we just published

318
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,480
last year on the group bfis we have a C3

319
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,198
ancestral CLA that's in assister

320
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,199
position to a C4 clay and we have this

321
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,519
intermediate CLA branching here that

322
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,479
through a preliminary survey of cray

323
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,839
type anatomy in the leaves looks to have

324
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,440
a lot of intermediate States and so now

325
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,959
uh in six weeks I'm going to South

326
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,160
Africa with my PhD student and we're

327
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,119
going to collect a bunch of these guys

328
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,519
so that we can develop a living

329
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,600
evolutionary model of

330
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,959
C4 now between our efforts and efforts

331
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,159
of others in the field we've been able

332
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,078
to come up with a pretty good map of C4

333
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:47,159
evolution in the in the higher plants

334
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:50,198
and as you see here uh there's a cluster

335
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,439
in the grasses the sges and grasses are

336
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:55,078
collectively the graminoids there's a

337
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,600
cluster in the carop feles order and

338
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,838
then there's a number of scattered

339
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,720
groups of varying sizes uh in the

340
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,920
angiosperms and when we go and look

341
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,920
carefully we can identify over 60

342
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,599
independent lineages of C4 Evolution

343
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:14,719
which is kind of surprising given that

344
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:19,000
it's a fairly complex trait

345
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,160
um now with this uh ability to use the

346
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
philogynes we can also go and use a

347
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:27,639
molecular clock approach to estimate

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,958
when C4 evolved in these distinct

349
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,959
lineages and my colleague Pascal

350
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:35,559
Christian did this in a paper that uh he

351
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,399
published for grasses in 2008 and then

352
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,518
we published for grasses and UDOT in

353
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,679
2011 which is summarized in my annual

354
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,560
review

355
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:51,039
here and this shows the spread between

356
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:55,879
the um stem node and the crown node with

357
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:58,198
the midpoint there for 46 lineages of

358
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,120
grasses and UDOT and you see that

359
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,838
beginning about 30 million years ago

360
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,159
based on molecular clock approaches the

361
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:09,959
C4 lineages diverged from ancestral C3

362
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:13,039
lineages and as you come forward in time

363
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,239
over the past 50 million years you get

364
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:19,278
more and more lineages appearing now we

365
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,799
can link this up with changes in Earth's

366
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:25,000
climate and atmosphere so if we look at

367
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,278
atmospheric CO2 content shown here this

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,159
beginning here correlates with a drop in

369
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,439
atmospheric CO2 down towards levels

370
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,639
similar to today and consistently

371
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,839
geological Studies have shown C4

372
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,318
Isotopes and fossils and then evidence

373
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,319
of big expansion of C4 grasslands and

374
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,439
other ecosystems in the subsequent 20 to

375
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,078
30 million year

376
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,519
period now recently what I wanted to do

377
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,120
is look at this in a little more detail

378
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,318
and on the next graphs I'm going to show

379
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,440
you responses related to the midpoint

380
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:03,039
between stem and Crown nodes uh

381
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,558
in these projected dates so what I did

382
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,438
is I went and was able to estimate the

383
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:13,160
number of species for uh each of the

384
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,279
projected C4 lineages and now we can

385
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,000
estimate the time Origins for 52

386
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,318
lineages which is shown here and what

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,720
you can see is that using the midpoint

388
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,359
just to keep the graph kind of clean

389
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:32,160
here's the range between crown and stem

390
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:34,240
nodes for the 52 of the 60 lineages you

391
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
can see that the older lineages are the

392
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,120
ones that have become the most

393
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,558
specious with three grass lineages

394
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,639
chlorid doids

395
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:47,279
andropogon and the melind group being

396
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,960
the most specious the UDOT which tend to

397
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,798
be about as old as the grasses the older

398
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,120
ones are more specious and as you come

399
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:58,918
down to the younger groups such a um you

400
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,678
find that in grasses in the red

401
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,759
triangles OTS in the black circles and

402
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,200
sges in the blue symbols in the last 5

403
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:10,679
to 10 million years all the groups are

404
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,120
fairly small in terms of species number

405
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,880
and then we can look at when these

406
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,038
lineages occur just to the number of

407
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,240
lineages as a function of the last 30

408
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:23,359
million years starting here uh 20 to 30

409
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,880
million years ago and then a burst of

410
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:30,279
evolutionary diversification in the last

411
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,799
15 million years now this is a recent

412
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:36,759
CO2 graph with oxygen isotope data that

413
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:39,319
gives a climate proxy I'll just focus on

414
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:42,158
co2 this is a paper out of Mark pagani's

415
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,759
group at Yale that used a number of

416
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,840
proxies to estimate CO2 levels over the

417
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,400
last 40 million years uh here we are

418
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,079
today 40 million years ago and at the

419
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,880
time 40 to 30 million years ago CO2

420
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,918
levels are projected to be high by a

421
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,400
number of complimentary proxies and then

422
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,919
in the late oliga scene about 25 million

423
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,320
years ago the CO2 level drops down a

424
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,840
little bit of a drop here and then over

425
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:12,839
the last 15 million years it's been

426
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:17,038
about what it was um in recent

427
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:20,639
geological time with a drop down to uh

428
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,240
below 300 PPM in the last ice age now

429
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,080
putting on this graph from the previous

430
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,558
panel I showed you to just allow you to

431
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,439
look at CO2 versus C4 evolutionary

432
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:37,119
diversification you see in these higher

433
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,440
CO2 periods a few groups diverged um and

434
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,359
then in the low CO2 periods of the last

435
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
20 million years is when most of them

436
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,599
diverged and then if you look right

437
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:49,399
after this little drop from about 500 to

438
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,678
somewhere around 400 PPM that's where

439
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,038
you get the greatest level of Divergence

440
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,320
so that looks like changes in

441
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:01,038
atmospheric CO2 were one of the drivers

442
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,960
or perhaps you will preconditions for

443
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:08,240
evolutionary diversification of

444
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:12,000
C4 now we've been working on how C4

445
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,000
evolved and uh beginning with work by

446
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Russ Monson in the genus flaria and

447
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,400
continuing with many other groups I

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,279
picked up on this you know in the last

449
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,320
15 years and we've come up with a

450
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:27,158
conceptual model for how you can build a

451
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:30,359
C4 plant and it basically follows as

452
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,640
I'll explained so from an ancestral C3

453
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,759
condition you have anatomical

454
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,759
preconditioning which we suspect might

455
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:40,480
be things such as um close vein spacing

456
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,759
High genetic

457
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,240
duplication um and then we you we

458
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,079
propose that you have enlargement of

459
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,558
bundle sheath cells with more organel in

460
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,038
the bundle sheath cells so that the

461
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,558
bundle sheath becomes physiologically

462
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,000
engaged and

463
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,798
activated and then we have mitochondria

464
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,200
for some reason and moving to the inner

465
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:04,960
bundle sheath wall and together at this

466
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,840
stage you get what we call the protoc

467
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,120
cran condition because you see hints of

468
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:13,000
crayons Anatomy starting in these

469
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,000
otherwise C3 plants and then you get a

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,079
key mutation where you lose glycine

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,960
decarboxylase expression in the misail

472
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,558
and it's only expressed in the bundle

473
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,159
sheet cells and associated with

474
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,038
mitochondrial enlargement and further

475
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,440
elaboration of misail to bundle sheath

476
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:33,319
Ray shows you get what's called a

477
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,880
photorespiratory CO2 pump or a condition

478
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,798
we call C2

479
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,278
photosynthesis and once this is

480
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:43,639
established you get upregulation of the

481
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:45,919
C4 cycle which then leads to full C4

482
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,000
photosynthesis so what I want to do now

483
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,240
is to show you some of the evidence we

484
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,038
have from two groups uh heliotropium and

485
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:00,519
nne one's a UDOT one's a grass for this

486
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,519
particular model

487
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,080
okay so before I begin I want to just go

488
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,798
over photorespiration a little bit so

489
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,480
some of this might make sense so here's

490
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,759
the photorespiratory

491
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,278
pathway uh phosphoglycolate made by the

492
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,278
oxygenation of RVP is converted to

493
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:19,240
glycine in the proxy this goes to the

494
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:23,400
mitochondria where an enzyme glycine

495
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,000
decarboxylase acts upon it releasing CO2

496
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,278
and Serene and the Serene is made back

497
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,558
to PGA and the CO2 Pres presumedly is

498
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:35,359
able to escape from the

499
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:37,720
cell okay now this CO2 under high

500
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,479
photorespiratory conditions actually can

501
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,440
be viewed as a resource and if the plant

502
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,278
can uh compartmentalize the release of

503
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,038
this GDC it can actually set up a

504
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:50,319
condition where this CO2 can drive

505
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,519
improved

506
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,639
photosynthesis and so Russ Monson

507
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,839
proposed some years

508
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,080
ago that you get a specialization of of

509
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:03,720
the photorespiratory pathway into two

510
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,278
cell types the misail and bundle sheath

511
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,079
and this simply happens when you lose

512
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,839
GDC expression in

513
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,158
misail uh

514
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,000
mitochondria and if you have enough

515
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,919
mitochondria in the bundle sheath which

516
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,679
you can have in a physiologically

517
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,880
activated bundle sheath then the

518
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,360
photorespiratory glycine that's produced

519
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,880
will have to flow from the misop which

520
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,119
is much more voluminous into the bundle

521
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,799
sheet cells where it can be acted upon

522
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:33,599
by DDC to release

523
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:37,200
CO2 and any chloroplasts then that are

524
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,719
nearby can take this CO2 and assimilate

525
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,240
it at a much higher efficiency than what

526
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,400
occur out in the misail so you would in

527
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,558
essence then get a a CO2 concentrating

528
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,440
mechanism formed simply by the

529
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:54,038
relocalization of

530
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,200
GDC so we went into heliotropium section

531
00:23:54,038 --> 00:24:00,720
orthos stakis which Mike Frolic had

532
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,960
identified as having C3 C4 and C3 C4

533
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,360
intermediate species and taking Leaf

534
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,400
samples we characterize their Anatomy we

535
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,918
developed a philogyny which is shown

536
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,960
here and we looked at some of the

537
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,799
physiological and more recently some of

538
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,079
the molecular traits now the species we

539
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,079
collected are heliotropium calula and

540
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:27,000
telum here at the base of the orthos

541
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:30,439
stakis clay we got heliotropium kinsky

542
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,278
and procumbens here further up the CLA

543
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,960
we got a C4 heliotropium texanum and

544
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,038
then these two

545
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,519
intermediates convol aium and grei so

546
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:44,720
you see a sense of evolution

547
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:47,079
philogenetic um progression from a

548
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,038
distal to a more or from a basil to a

549
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:54,000
more distal series of branches with C4

550
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,000
being acquired in the more distal

551
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
branches now here is the anatomical

552
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,759
progression that we see

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,558
as we move from a more basal to a more

554
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:08,839
distal position and this is typically

555
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:11,519
C3 small bundle she cells without many

556
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,199
organel in this heliotropium telum you

557
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,879
begin to see inflation of the bundle

558
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,278
sheet cells but not many organel

559
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,919
heliotropium karwinski you begin to see

560
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:23,038
sort of a rounding out of the bundle

561
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,600
sheath cells into something that sort of

562
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,319
looking like yeah preliminary first

563
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,798
phase cran Anatomy here's here we have

564
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,319
Troian PR cumbin with pronounced but

565
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,960
smallish bundle sheet cells and here we

566
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,720
are in the intermediate heliotropium

567
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,798
convol aaum and you can clearly see a

568
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,038
bundle sheath vascular patterning

569
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,519
becoming more pronounced and in the

570
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,879
intermediate heliotropium grei it begins

571
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,278
to look almost C4 like with big bundle

572
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,440
sheets and then here are your

573
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:58,640
C4s now the data compiled from

574
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,798
this shows that the misail tissues drop

575
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,000
off in their percentage of the leaf

576
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:06,319
cross-sections in the C4s but not so

577
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,038
much in the c3s OR intermediates but the

578
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,599
big change is a buildup of bundle sheath

579
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,759
volume as you go along this this

580
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:17,599
philogenetic gradient from the basal to

581
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,558
the more distal c3s and then into the

582
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,918
intermediates and the C4s and this is

583
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:26,359
seen also as a reduction in misail to

584
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:29,880
bundle sheath ratio vein do density

585
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,678
doesn't change because the c3s has start

586
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,080
out with a high vein density that's

587
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,399
similar to the

588
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:39,480
C4s which might be a preconditioning

589
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:42,479
trait now we look at organel levels in

590
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,558
these things uh here we see organel per

591
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,319
bundle she cell uh and this is for the

592
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,000
chloroplast this is for the mitochondria

593
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,398
and then this is looking at the position

594
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,960
of those organel the percent of organel

595
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:59,398
in the inner bundle sheath going from

596
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,038
the basil species in that clay C3 is

597
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:05,398
guys into the intermediates and then

598
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:08,640
finally the C4s and you don't really see

599
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:10,479
any C3 progression In chloroplast

600
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,640
numbers the intermediates have much

601
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,278
higher chloroplast numbers the C4s have

602
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,200
variable um this has few chloroplasts

603
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:23,119
but they're gigantic the mitochondria in

604
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,759
the c3s you see uh relatively low here

605
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,199
but in the bundle sheath of heliotropium

606
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,480
kinsky I we see a significantly enhanced

607
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,679
number of mitochondria and then they get

608
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,640
to be quite high in the um

609
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,960
intermediates now the positioning though

610
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,159
shows a dramatic change as we go up the

611
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,919
philogyny towards the more distal

612
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,200
branches you see a progressive shift of

613
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,120
chloroplast POS positioning from the

614
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,200
outer half to the inner half such that

615
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,639
by the time you're in the intermediates

616
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,360
most of the chloroplasts are on the

617
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,200
inside and the mitochondria seem to show

618
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:04,678
the same shift so there's one C3 a

619
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,759
second C3 and a third C3 species as

620
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:12,080
you're going from basil to the node

621
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:14,839
that's sister to the intermediate and C4

622
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,678
branches we looked at glycine DC carboxy

623
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:18,678
a

624
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,759
localization here's the C3 each of these

625
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,880
brown spots is where you have staining

626
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,798
for gine decarboxylase in the

627
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,600
mitochondria this would reflect a

628
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:31,398
mitochondria and you see in hel rium

629
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:34,678
telum the basil C3 it's scattered

630
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:38,599
throughout the misail heliotropium

631
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,360
Kinski which is a few nodes more distal

632
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,759
towards the C4 clades you see the

633
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:47,000
glycine decarbox is scattered throughout

634
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,720
the misil but you see this

635
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,519
characteristic or this uh interesting

636
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,839
banding right around the inner part of

637
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:57,120
the bundle sheath hopium procumbens you

638
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,359
see that banding a little more strongly

639
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,879
this is physiolog ically a C3 species

640
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,000
and when you get into the intermediates

641
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,240
you see no decarbox expression out in

642
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,319
the misail and it's all concentrated

643
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,759
into the bundle sheath especially along

644
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,038
the inner half of the cell lining the

645
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:18,960
vasculature and here's another view in

646
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:21,720
heliotropium grei a C3 C4

647
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,038
intermediate and heliotropium texanum

648
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,600
shows a typical C4 pattern where GDC is

649
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,398
restricted to the bundle

650
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,439
sheath now I want to look at what's

651
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,678
going on in

652
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,360
karwinski a C3 species

653
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,960
physiologically and here you see this

654
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:42,199
vasculature which is larger and more

655
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,319
pronounced it's not huge by C4 standards

656
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,440
but it's big by C3 standards and here's

657
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,278
the GDC stain and you see there's a lot

658
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,278
of GDC staining along the inner part of

659
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,200
the bundle sheath cells here's the GDC

660
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,640
out in the

661
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,480
misail so we looked at the transmission

662
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,159
electron micrograph at was what's going

663
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
on and there's very few mitochondria

664
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,640
visible in this outer part and instead

665
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,640
they have lined up onto this inner part

666
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,480
here where they are associated with a

667
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,440
few chloroplasts so we've had in this C3

668
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,200
species that's sister to the

669
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,720
intermediates a polarization of

670
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,640
mitochondrial

671
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,519
distribution now when we go to the full

672
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,159
C3 C4 intermediate heliotropium

673
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:33,079
convum a very fairly pron Ed bundle

674
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,720
sheath enlargement very pronounced GDC

675
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,798
localization to the inner part of the

676
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,558
bundle sheath and when we look at it at

677
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:43,720
the tem we see a very high number of

678
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:46,119
mitochondria here here here and this cap

679
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,399
of chloroplast layering over them and

680
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,879
this is along this inner part of the

681
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:53,599
bundle sheath here's another view

682
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,679
here and

683
00:30:53,599 --> 00:31:01,798
so this then is the classic c3c for

684
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,559
intermediate anatomy and physiology and

685
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:07,558
the idea is is that photorespiratory

686
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:11,038
glycine formed out in the misail has to

687
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:14,599
travel to these layer of mitochondria

688
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:18,558
here to be metabolized and release CO2

689
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:19,879
which these chloroplasts can scarf up uh

690
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,798
with high

691
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,519
efficiency and here's a diagram of this

692
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:28,638
mechanism where photorespiration

693
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,960
produces glycolate which is made into

694
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,240
glycine it comes into these

695
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,360
mitochondria because mitochondria out in

696
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,599
the misop have no GDC mitochondria and

697
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,879
the bundle sheath have the GDC the CO2

698
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:45,398
is released upon metabolism of this

699
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,559
glycine Serene goes back to complete the

700
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:51,439
photorespiratory cycle this CO2 builds

701
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,839
up to about three times maybe four times

702
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,639
what otherwise would be allowing these

703
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:59,000
chloroplasts to operate at high

704
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:02,479
efficiency and the effect of this on

705
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,759
photosynthesis is visible here C3

706
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,919
photosynthesis that photosynthesis is a

707
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:11,440
function of intercellular CO2 in the c3s

708
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:17,600
you have a high CO2 compensation point a

709
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,600
shallower slope than you would in a c4 a

710
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:24,918
uh slowly saturating response and in the

711
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,960
C2 type this is based on C2 or this is

712
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,519
based on

713
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,519
heliotropium you have a reduction

714
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,240
in

715
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:37,120
CO2 compensation Point slightly bigger

716
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,200
initial slope and an overall improved

717
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:44,839
photosynthetic performance at low

718
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,759
CO2 now I switched into talking about C2

719
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:51,879
photosynthesis and this is a term that I

720
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,879
coined uh to ref to try and come up with

721
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,840
something that physiologically describes

722
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,880
this

723
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,558
metabolism separate from the term C3 C4

724
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,799
intermediacy which had been used

725
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:03,798
previously and it refers to the two

726
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,480
carbons in this glycine molecule that

727
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:08,798
shuttle CO2 into this internal

728
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,278
compartment of the bundle sheath in a

729
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:14,359
similar manner as the four carbons in

730
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:17,440
melate that shuttles CO2 into the bundle

731
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:20,319
sheath in C4 and the reason I came up

732
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,519
with this uh is because we were running

733
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:27,558
into confusion between what is a C3 C4

734
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,679
intermediate trait and what would be um

735
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,398
a physiology that could exist in a much

736
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,919
wider range of plants than those that

737
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:34,918
are evolving towards

738
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:42,679
C4 now just quickly another group The

739
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,679
narachan we've been studying and this

740
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:50,278
has C3 C uh C3 C4 intermediates and C4

741
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,360
species we collected eight in the Wilds

742
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:55,720
of Australia in sites like this here's

743
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,558
the intermediate species neurac minor

744
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,120
growing in a in a pot a a rocky pothole

745
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,038
that's been formed and here I just want

746
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,038
to show you bundle sheath and misail

747
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,280
this is actually a specialized layer

748
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,918
called the misto sheath it's not

749
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,320
anatomically proper bundle sheath but

750
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,158
it's a vascular sheath layer and I want

751
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,480
to look at the mitochondria per cell GDC

752
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:23,280
per mitochondria based on um the number

753
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,119
of gold particles appearing in an imino

754
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,399
blot stain and the GDC Percell area

755
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,879
which is

756
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,480
uh GDC per mitochondria times the number

757
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:36,199
of mitochondria and I'm expressing this

758
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,838
as a function of CO2 compensation point

759
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:42,878
where C3 values are high right here and

760
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:45,159
C4 values are the zero ones right there

761
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:48,319
now in the bundle sheath we see the

762
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,599
number of mitochondria per cell going up

763
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,000
as we go to lower CO2 compensation

764
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,639
points and then it comes down into the

765
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,880
C4 the GDC perito goes up as we go to

766
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,119
lower CO2 compensation points and

767
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,559
correspondingly in the misail the GDC

768
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:07,400
levels come down in a progression and

769
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,838
then the number of gold particles per

770
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,200
cell area which is a function of mitos

771
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,719
and so on you see going up so you're

772
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:19,159
getting a lot more GDC in the bundle in

773
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:22,239
the sheath cells and a bit less out in

774
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,159
the misail so you're seeing a similar

775
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,000
pattern to what we see in heliotropium

776
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,639
in this grass group of gradual

777
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,358
enhancement

778
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:37,400
of GDC in the in the sheath cells while

779
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:42,119
the misop prog expression goes

780
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,358
down okay now through the taxonomic or

781
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,320
the philogenetic work and the isotope

782
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:51,799
work we've now identified uh a dozen

783
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,480
independent lineages where this C3 C4

784
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,440
intermediate condition is is sister to

785
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,000
the um uh C4 condition using this

786
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,318
pattern of C2

787
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,318
photosynthesis but we've also identified

788
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:08,480
four clades with no evolutionary

789
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:10,920
relationship between C4 photosynthesis

790
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,559
and the expression of this C2

791
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,039
photosynthesis type

792
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,358
metabolism now here we have this again

793
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,599
and what I want to emphasize and this I

794
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,519
got to thinking about this and thinking

795
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:26,039
about the fact that this metabolism does

796
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,719
not necessarily have to be associated

797
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,079
with C4 evolution

798
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,118
that it could operate as a Bonafide

799
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,400
carbon concentrating mechanism in its

800
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,358
own right and a key thing about this is

801
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,240
no additional ATP expenditure is

802
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,679
required so you have a buildup of

803
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,000
glycine from high

804
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,519
photorespiration and by a strategic

805
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,400
relocalization of GDC into this one

806
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,639
compartment where chloroplast can be

807
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,280
enhanced you can affect CO2

808
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,480
concentration without spending any extra

809
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,760
energy so we have then a passive CO2

810
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,079
concentrating

811
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,240
mechanism and it's kind of interesting

812
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,760
to think that in the case of C4

813
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:11,000
Evolution the evolution of this passive

814
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,000
mechanism to scavenge

815
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,440
photorespiration or or built the bridge

816
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:22,199
if you will to the C4 condition by

817
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,760
setting up this um structural misail a

818
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,960
bundle sheath system and upon this you

819
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,079
could then layer on the active C4

820
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,280
metabolic

821
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:36,160
cycle now this pyramid diagram just

822
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,160
shows the diversity of photosynthetic

823
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:42,799
CCMS inorganic pumping of bicarbonate

824
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:45,920
cam C4 and now the C2 passive

825
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,560
type but it got me to thinking what

826
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,599
might be going on in the

827
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:54,358
c3s are they playing with

828
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,960
photorespiratory CO2 to enhance rabisco

829
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:00,598
efficiency and so we decided to go and

830
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,119
look for passive CCM type conditions in

831
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,559
the C3 uh flora and I'd like to begin

832
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,280
with

833
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,759
rice now we went and looked at Rice

834
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,319
misail cells uh as part of the C4

835
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,560
engineering project and one of the

836
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:18,079
things that struck me about these in

837
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:21,519
this longitudinal section here is the

838
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,318
chloroplast form this dense layer around

839
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,000
the periphery of the cell here you see a

840
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:29,599
nice view of

841
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,119
that and the mitochondria here here here

842
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,318
here are all positioned to the interior

843
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,800
of this chloroplast layer which is quite

844
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:39,480
thick and where you have gaps between

845
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,480
chloroplasts as right here you get these

846
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,079
extensions forming where the chloroplast

847
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:48,000
blbs out to form uh a seal between the

848
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,240
two of them and block off direct e-lux

849
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,079
Roots out of the cell here we see

850
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,199
transverse sections and you see there's

851
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,318
a chloroplast in these lobed protrusions

852
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,279
of the misail cell here's my mondria to

853
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:03,719
the inner part and here's these

854
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,400
extensions what we call stromal

855
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,598
extensions and here's some high mags of

856
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,519
the extensions here you see an extension

857
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,119
sealing off a gap between two

858
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,519
chloroplasts here's a bunch of

859
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,559
mitochondria sandwich between the

860
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,199
chloroplasts here's a case where the

861
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,838
chloroplast has actually been enveloped

862
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:25,318
by these chloroplast extensions and

863
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:27,679
there's another case there and this got

864
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:31,400
us to thinking what could possibly be

865
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:33,399
going on here we did an imuno gold blot

866
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,880
for rabisco and found that in these

867
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,079
extensions or stromules you have Risco

868
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,599
present here's a mitochondria that's

869
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,800
blocked off from the periphery of the

870
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:47,880
cell by the stromal

871
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,560
extension and so we then redrew the

872
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:54,079
typical appearance of a C3 Leaf to

873
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:57,480
create it something like this layered on

874
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:02,000
the photorespiratory cycle here oxygen

875
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,159
is being uh taken up carboxylating rubp

876
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
to form phosphoglycolate the glycine

877
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,480
then is metabolized by GDC in the rice

878
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,039
mitochondria CO2 is released but it's

879
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,400
released into this internal space and

880
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,920
the only way out is through a

881
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,838
chloroplast or the stromal extension

882
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,119
which gives rabisco a chance to capture

883
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,799
and refix this CO2 and under high

884
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,720
photorespiratory conditions this surge

885
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:32,039
of CO2 produced could potentially

886
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,358
enhance the amount of uh CO2 in the

887
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,358
chloroplast and improve rabisco

888
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:40,838
efficiency so to test this I formed a

889
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:43,519
collaboration with Tammy Sage uh my

890
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:46,480
faculty colleague Ace of cousins floran

891
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:49,880
bush is my postto and in a paper

892
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,480
published in PCN a few years ago we

893
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,760
presented the results of our study now

894
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,318
what we you wanted to do is to measure

895
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,720
directly the amount of fixation of

896
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:02,960
photor resir and respired CO2 by

897
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:05,439
chloroplast before it can leave the cell

898
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,400
to do this we used a pulse Chase system

899
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,440
with carbon 13 where we first loaded the

900
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,680
leaves with carbon 12 and then we all of

901
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,760
a sudden switched them to carbon 13 a

902
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,960
pure carbon 13 CO2 source so

903
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,560
assimilation of carbon 13 measured by a

904
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,720
mass spec would give us photosynthesis

905
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,480
this way and then we'd be able to

906
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:28,279
measure the respiration signal by the

907
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,559
carbon 12 coming off and the carbon 12

908
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,280
that was refixed here would presumably

909
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,880
be coming from these

910
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,000
mitochondria okay and through a series

911
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,358
of

912
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,280
mathematical uh calculations we were

913
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,480
able to estimate a number of

914
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,480
things and we did the measurements at

915
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,880
350 PPM and

916
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:54,159
30° and in rice which has chloroplast

917
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,880
coverage of the misil of 99% so 99% of

918
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,559
the misail exposed to intercellular

919
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,559
space is covered by chloroplast we

920
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,279
measured the total reassimilation of

921
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:08,159
photo respired and respired CO2 was

922
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,680
about 51% and 29% of that was coming

923
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,639
from CO2 that was directly reassimilated

924
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:13,719
from

925
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,358
mitochondria and we modeled then that

926
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:20,439
the increase in chloroplast CO2 due to

927
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:22,598
this was 14 PPM and this led to an 11%

928
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,559
enhancement of

929
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,599
photosynthesis now we repeated the

930
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,200
measurements at 200 PPM which was the

931
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:32,280
CO2 level 20,000 years ago here the

932
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:36,199
total reassimilation was estimated at

933
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,680
59% of respired and photor resir CO2

934
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:41,318
intracellular reassimilation was

935
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:45,480
38% we estimated that the CO2

936
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:47,599
concentration inside was enhanced by 16

937
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,280
parts per million from this photor resir

938
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,000
CO2 and that boosted co uh

939
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,400
photosynthesis by

940
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,760
33% over what it otherwise would have

941
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,838
been and at these low CO2 conditions

942
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,040
this level of enhancement is actually

943
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,838
starting to become

944
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:07,920
substantial we did the same for wheat

945
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:09,960
wheat also forms these stromules here's

946
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,240
a mitochondria and there's two stromules

947
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,079
this is the view you would get if you

948
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,439
were looking at the wheat cell standing

949
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,720
face on and you can see the high

950
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,318
coverage of chloroplast with only a few

951
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:24,558
gaps between them and so this

952
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,759
effectively forms a

953
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,880
cage that will force photor resir CO2

954
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,200
through the chloroplast as it's

955
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,000
diffusing from the mitochondria to the

956
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:36,399
outside of the

957
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,760
leaf and we just did these measurements

958
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,480
at 350 PPM and we estimated that the CO2

959
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,640
concentration in the chloroplast from

960
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,639
this

961
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,059
[Music]

962
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,280
so we call this refixation of

963
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:26,000
photorespiration for the hot uh dry

964
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,719
conditions that you would have in these

965
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,280
kinds of environments

966
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,039
and so one of the things we want to do

967
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,640
in coming years is actually screen wild

968
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:39,920
populations in these environments prone

969
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:42,759
to photorespiration for this kind of uh

970
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,119
anatomy And it raises a paradox of the

971
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,839
modern biosphere which is the CO2

972
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,240
concentration in the recent atmosphere

973
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:53,000
was quite low it got down to 180 PPM

974
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,639
20,000 years ago which in the tropics

975
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
would cause high levels of

976
00:44:55,639 --> 00:45:02,838
photorespiration it averaged around 230

977
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,358
240 PPM throughout the Ice Age based on

978
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:09,318
Ice core records um and so these

979
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:10,719
conditions would be strongly inhibitory

980
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:13,358
because of increased

981
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,879
photorespiration you had C4 plants out

982
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,679
there who would have provided very

983
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,358
strong competition yet despite all of

984
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,118
this 90% of the Earth's plant species

985
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:24,078
are

986
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,800
C3 and most of the C3 plants occur in

987
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,440
the

988
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,000
tropics most of the low latitude biomes

989
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,079
are dominated by

990
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,159
c3s and C4 is actually rare and absent

991
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,760
in most life forms such as trees and

992
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,480
Vines so although C4s do well in certain

993
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,839
situations like grasslands they are not

994
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,599
the dominant vegetation of the warm

995
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,400
parts of the planet even in these very

996
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,200
low CO2

997
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,000
times um and so we're wondering whether

998
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:53,000
recycling a

999
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:03,119
set or compensate for these low CO2

1000
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:05,679
conditions

1001
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,480
now we've come up with the term passive

1002
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:10,399
CO2 concentration to describe the C2

1003
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,559
photosynthetic system that can lead to

1004
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:18,318
C4 or can exist independent of any C4

1005
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,720
Evolution and we've described uh some of

1006
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:24,000
the criteria that would fit a passive

1007
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,919
CO2 concentration so CO2 around some

1008
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,039
rabisco is enhanced by strategic

1009
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,318
placement of MIT andrial CO2

1010
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,239
assimilation or CO2

1011
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,800
emission no extra energy is required

1012
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:38,358
hence the passive aspect you need a

1013
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,760
resistive barrier to slow the efux of

1014
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:43,480
mitochondrial

1015
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:47,559
CO2 the Risco needs to have specifically

1016
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,679
enhanced photo CO2 and photosynthesis in

1017
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:50,680
these regions where the

1018
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:03,000
selection You could argue that it's a

1019
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,000
Bonafide adaptive feature um in and of

1020
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,838
its own

1021
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,639
right and of course if it enhances

1022
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:10,239
carbon gain and fitness so I've

1023
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,400
described C2

1024
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:15,799
photosynthesis but we're arguing that

1025
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,800
this mechanism seen in rice and its

1026
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:22,680
allies here is also a passive CO2

1027
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,160
concentrating mechanism it's not a huge

1028
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,679
impact but especially at low CO2 it's a

1029
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:31,159
significant impact that could maybe

1030
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,919
enhance plant Fitness enough to offset

1031
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:35,239
the

1032
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,480
potential uh for say out competition by

1033
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:38,919
C4

1034
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,318
plants now when we think about passive

1035
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,440
CO2 systems we got to move and think

1036
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:47,119
Beyond just photorespiration but also

1037
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,559
respiratory CO2 and where you get thick

1038
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:54,119
respiratory CO2 tissue such as stems or

1039
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:56,960
fruits then by putting a barrier in

1040
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:00,240
place you can actually have a passive

1041
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,079
CO2 concentrating mechanism so here we

1042
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,639
have the stem of a birch and you have

1043
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,920
this particular sclerotic layer a scorin

1044
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,639
layer in the outer part of the stem

1045
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,200
here's the florum pinka and the

1046
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:13,960
chloroplast and the florum pinka are

1047
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:16,639
autof floring showing that they're

1048
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,480
fairly potentially physiologically

1049
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,078
active respiratory CO2 produced in this

1050
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,800
stem could diffuse out but get held up

1051
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,880
by this scoren layer and potentially

1052
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,359
build up to a point where photosynthesis

1053
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,720
in this FL layer and maybe down here in

1054
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,799
the pith layer is enhanced so that

1055
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,239
rabisco can operate very

1056
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,000
efficiently in

1057
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,759
cinella you have a condition where a

1058
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
thick cortical layer could provide a

1059
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,240
resistive barrier and then you have

1060
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,599
these lacune that form and diffuse up

1061
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:51,759
from below ground tissues bringing

1062
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,359
respired CO2 with them and alining these

1063
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,799
and by linning these below ground or

1064
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,078
these laun from below ground with

1065
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:02,719
chloroplast the CO2 that's coming up

1066
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:05,880
from below ground from Roots and tuber

1067
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,519
romes and even soil respired CO2 could

1068
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,760
allow these chloroplasts to operate with

1069
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:14,920
high levels of

1070
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:17,720
efficiency so these may fit the criteria

1071
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,760
of a passive CCM and it would be worth

1072
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,078
going back and looking at many of these

1073
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,000
species to see if these are specific

1074
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,440
adaptations to improve the carbon

1075
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,400
balance of these plants um

1076
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:35,679
in geological times of low

1077
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,680
CO2 okay so if

1078
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,920
uh that's it uh just a quick thanks to

1079
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:45,639
my funer insert my various posto and

1080
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,519
grad students uh who have worked with me

1081
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:50,879
on the project Pascal Christian who we

1082
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,719
collaborated with on a lot of the phog

1083
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,320
genetics and with that I'll take

1084
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,509
questions

1085
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,510
[Applause]

1086
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,160
guess the obvious question is why don't

1087
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:08,599
all CS do this they

1088
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:13,239
me do what do do do which of these the

1089
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:17,000
traic traic but that Rice does uh they

1090
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:19,679
may we've looked at a half a dozen crop

1091
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,440
species and they all do it to some

1092
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,679
degrees some of them don't do it as much

1093
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,960
as rice rice and wheat stand out in

1094
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:30,399
having a very high chloroplast

1095
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,079
number so you get that complete sheath

1096
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,599
around the periphery that's expensive in

1097
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:37,798
terms of uh nitrogen and other things

1098
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,680
and when you go to low nitrogen you see

1099
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:42,358
the chloroplast becoming fewer in number

1100
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,480
and they spread apart gaps form between

1101
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:46,679
them and then you see the refixation

1102
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,119
potential going way down as CO2

1103
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:52,679
presumably leaks out much more readily

1104
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,680
so there's a cost associated with it um

1105
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,358
but one of the things you see in the C3

1106
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:59,239
plants is the chloroplasts tend to be

1107
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:02,159
very thin and pushed up against the

1108
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:05,318
periphery indicating that evolution is

1109
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,798
made for these small thin chloroplast

1110
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:11,000
but a lot of them uh when you go to the

1111
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:12,719
C4s for example you don't have that you

1112
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,199
have fewer chloroplasts than many of

1113
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,639
them are much bigger because they don't

1114
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:20,279
have photorespiration occurring out in

1115
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,519
the me so they don't have this

1116
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,119
evolutionary uh imperative to have to

1117
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:28,679
deal with so yeah but most seem to have

1118
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,720
the ability to do this if they have

1119
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:34,159
enough nitrogen and can build enough

1120
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:36,519
Chlor yeah so obviously there's there's

1121
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:39,159
potentially a lot of inits to making

1122
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,679
this decision between a c2v mechanism or

1123
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:44,159
not but how about temperature because

1124
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,879
temperature affects the CO2 and oxygen

1125
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,798
solubility do you see with increasing

1126
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,358
temperature among C3 species a greater

1127
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:55,239
propensity of C2 concent all the C2

1128
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,400
concentrating mechanisms and all those

1129
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:01,399
cles that I showed you

1130
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,358
um are very high temperature climate

1131
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,079
plants okay so if you go to lower

1132
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,880
temperatures then you see less you don't

1133
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:11,760
see any of them yeah yeah so the C2

1134
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,280
mechanism that we see um all those

1135
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,280
groups listed

1136
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,159
here actually I think let me see if I

1137
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,838
got a picture of one of these guys

1138
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,399
growing in its natural

1139
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:28,400
habitat there this is the natural

1140
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,760
habitat curve C2 this is the Mojave

1141
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,318
Desert surface temperature here during

1142
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,480
the growing season is 65 C the leaves

1143
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,880
are working around here's the leaf

1144
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,159
temperature um starts off at 20° by the

1145
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,599
middle of the day it's approaching 50

1146
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,039
this is its growing season and it's

1147
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:51,480
supported by Monsoon rains that provide

1148
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:54,759
summer moisture um so at this condition

1149
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,480
especially at 300 or 280 PPM the

1150
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,280
pre-industrial CO2 L that would be

1151
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,318
really high photo respiration so that's

1152
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,200
a big slug of CO2 which on the one hand

1153
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,920
you could just let it go away or on the

1154
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:10,159
other hand by strategically placing your

1155
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,159
GDC then all of a sudden it's a great

1156
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:16,159
resource to to

1157
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:18,798
exploit yeah so following up on that a

1158
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,000
little bit I mean I buy that C2 is a

1159
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:24,838
precursor or whatever the

1160
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,079
C4 but why is C2

1161
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,318
maintained do you see environmental

1162
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,760
segregation between c2s and

1163
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:34,119
C4s you might have expected everybody

1164
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,599
that's in that kind of environment to

1165
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:41,559
eventually evolve towards a C4 and C2 to

1166
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:44,798
no longer be extent yeah um well

1167
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:48,480
everybody in this kind of environment

1168
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:50,719
um c3s do do well but they may be doing

1169
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,440
well because they're kind of sitting

1170
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,118
still when it's this hot they use early

1171
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,599
morning hours and close their stomates

1172
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,680
and sleep through the afternoon they

1173
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,318
take a Festa or they may be operative

1174
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:06,960
off seon during the winter or something

1175
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:10,279
so you do see a lot of the c34 such as

1176
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,119
um some of these guys just shutting down

1177
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,720
when it's this hot and there are C4s in

1178
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,000
that same these

1179
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:19,239
grasses yeah there C4s now one of the

1180
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
things about these c2s is they tend to

1181
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:25,399
occur in these Oddball

1182
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,318
environments or they tend to occur as

1183
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:32,440
weeds so for example the one that occurs

1184
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:34,000
around here is a a mugo vertic Salada

1185
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,240
which is called carpet weed and it grows

1186
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,199
on peop patios and lawns in July and

1187
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:43,118
August it's it's a fugitive species so

1188
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:45,358
it's sort of escapes competition by

1189
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,760
growing in these opportunistic but hot

1190
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:50,719
sites so if you have a black top in your

1191
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,280
driveway and you don't pull your weeds

1192
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:55,159
you're going to get carpet weed growing

1193
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,960
in Cornell in this kind of otherwise

1194
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:00,838
moist climate but it's a very hot

1195
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,079
micrite on that black top um so yeah

1196
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:06,358
these guys grow these very extreme

1197
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:09,160
sandings rocky surfaces gypsum

1198
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:12,759
surfaces uh or they grow where there's

1199
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:15,879
low competition due to extreme or recent

1200
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,200
disturbance um so they're kind of

1201
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,240
escapists the reason we think that is

1202
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:23,519
because once C4 evolves as the gas

1203
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,679
exchange diagram I showed you it's

1204
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,880
Superior and it just excludes these guys

1205
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,879
out they they're not strong competitors

1206
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:34,400
whereas the C4s

1207
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,519
are Dave um it was a great fascinating

1208
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,000
the work that's been done in the

1209
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:40,038
elucidation of the anatomical Evolution

1210
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,400
you didn't mention much about pep carox

1211
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,920
lasis versus Risco and I wonder if you

1212
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,200
just said a word about pep carox where

1213
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,519
that fits into the history whether there

1214
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:53,078
were other avenues of evolution and pep

1215
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:57,038
carox analogs and also kind of related

1216
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:59,798
to that could there be some reason why p

1217
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:02,520
carox is a challenging enzyme either to

1218
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:05,719
evolve or simply for a plant to maintain

1219
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:11,960
that reduces the prevalence of C4 well

1220
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:15,318
um so pep carboxy is uh the problem it

1221
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:18,358
has in the existing C3 metabolism is

1222
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:21,920
that it doesn't lead toit CO2 fixation

1223
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:25,119
so it it's a Gateway into the KB cycle

1224
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,680
but the carbon it produces OAA CB cycle

1225
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,680
intermediate

1226
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:31,159
and then melee to run it through the KB

1227
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,399
cycle you have to go off that CO2 fix

1228
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:34,519
during CB cycle metabolism so you don't

1229
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,440
get net

1230
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:39,838
fixation it's it actually serves a sort

1231
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,519
of a Gateway in and out of the cev cycle

1232
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,119
and and in and out of fatty acid

1233
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:48,639
metabolism and other things that need

1234
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:50,880
the CB cycle so to re-engineer pep

1235
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,798
carboxilate to fit into a net CO2

1236
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,920
fixation Loop you may have to go and

1237
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,639
screw up the CB cycle metabolism which

1238
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,119
would be a pretty big deal and

1239
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:03,838
challenging for plants Pepsi a itself is

1240
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,240
quite ubiquitous in Plants it's used in

1241
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:10,558
many physiological functions and it's

1242
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:13,038
there in in all of the land plants um so

1243
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,960
using it is not a problem you just need

1244
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,200
to upregulate it but you have to couple

1245
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,240
it with something that leads to net CO2

1246
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:24,199
fixation and the only carboxy AE in your

1247
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:26,679
carry outs that we know does that is is

1248
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:29,078
ristic now maybe if we wanted to get

1249
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:31,358
into synthetic biology and genetically

1250
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:33,359
engineer completely new photosynthetic

1251
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:36,440
thing we could pull a bacterial enzyme

1252
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:39,880
out a bacterial carboxilate and then put

1253
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:43,318
in some things and create a new fixation

1254
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:46,599
scheme and that's been discussed but um

1255
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:46,599
technologically we're not quite

1256
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:54,439
there um do you follow the evolutionary

1257
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:57,799
speciation based trajectory from C3 to

1258
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:00,119
C4 in the increasing the importance of

1259
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:02,599
metabolite transport between the bundle

1260
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:06,160
sheet and misop cells you follow that do

1261
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:08,039
you see increasing number complexity

1262
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,038
of well that's something that's

1263
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,640
something we actually want to go to all

1264
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:14,920
all of these intermediate guys we got

1265
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,239
most of these in collection now various

1266
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,480
stages of

1267
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,598
them go back these guys so we have most

1268
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,880
of these in

1269
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,640
collection but most of them only have a

1270
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,000
few so you can't really get an

1271
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:29,358
evolutionary progression because you

1272
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,119
only got one or two inter immediate

1273
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:34,639
stages okay most of them seem to pick on

1274
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:37,119
the pure C2 metabolism so there's not a

1275
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,598
lot of variation the different the

1276
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,400
exception isaria here with

1277
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:45,599
nine but then this one blus that I

1278
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,760
mentioned that we just did the phogy on

1279
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,440
it could have up to 30 intermediates and

1280
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,440
based on a preliminary screen with the

1281
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,599
Varian material looks like there's quite

1282
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,880
a bit of variation in this

1283
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:59,200
intermediate uh series of traits

1284
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,640
that's where you can go in and look at

1285
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,199
when along this so-called evolutionary

1286
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:07,639
progression you get step changes or

1287
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:13,038
gradual changes in the buildup of plasma

1288
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:15,440
do mod or changes in misil

1289
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:18,359
chloroplast which we've done for flaria

1290
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,159
we look at where this change in

1291
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:23,679
misop chloroplast number occurs and it

1292
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:26,679
seems to occur progressively that's just

1293
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:29,519
coming out now plant cell

1294
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:32,679
theology so yeah we can do that kind of

1295
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:35,759
thing but we need to have very specious

1296
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:37,838
intermediate groups do you have any

1297
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,000
question

1298
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:45,119
sorry among all these biogenetic studies

1299
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,599
you seen any evidence that C4 breaks

1300
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:53,480
down and falls back

1301
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:56,640
C uh yeah there's a few minor things um

1302
00:59:53,480 --> 01:00:00,199
elsis has pretty good evidence for

1303
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:07,000
reversion uh there's probably a

1304
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:09,439
reversion in um a in um the um suu group

1305
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,798
in the um

1306
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,280
um which is in uh oh I forget the name

1307
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:17,280
of this family now but there's good

1308
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,240
evidence for reversion there in a group

1309
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,440
called suian the genus but and there's

1310
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:26,838
possibilities in the kipot AC that

1311
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:29,358
you've had loss divers application of

1312
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:32,639
the reconstituted C3 and then

1313
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:35,719
reacquisition of C4 from that but is

1314
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,798
that a real loss and reacquisition or is

1315
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:41,279
that multiple evolutionary events and we

1316
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,358
need much finer plal genetic detail to

1317
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,039
be able to address those hypotheses and

1318
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:48,920
that's one of the priorities for coming

1319
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:51,359
years is to go into these groups that

1320
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,960
look to be fairly Dynamic and see

1321
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,598
whether they're dynamic or whether you

1322
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,240
just got multiple C4 spinning off of

1323
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,079
some

1324
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:01,759
predisposed C fre

1325
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:06,160
ancestry

1326
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,160
so I'm afraid we have to stop

1327
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:14,599
discussion this has been a production of

1328
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:17,598
Corell University on the web at

1329
