1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,679
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,039
University it was uh it was 22 years ago

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,320
this week we held the first US Open at

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,199
uh Beth Page black and I had the

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,439
pleasure of being on the crew as a much

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,480
younger man uh back then but of course

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,160
this was during the the height of the

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,920
Tiger Woods uh you know period of

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,960
dominance that you know Scotty Sheffer

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,519
may be uh uh going through so you start

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,320
him out young uh Ashley B Binky Binkley

12
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,399
is a golf course uh superintendent in

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,200
Canada and has these two love one lovely

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,399
kid who she's been showing on Twitter

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,200
forever and you know you just love

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,558
seeing this walking out there and of

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,559
course on a sad note there were a lot of

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,280
passings I you know I think for those of

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,078
us again that have dogs uh losing them

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,480
is really hard and I think it's great

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,799
that people share uh these things

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,878
especially for men who sometimes have a

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,640
tough time uh expressing emotions around

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,399
these things animals seemed to be a

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,359
place where uh men have figured out how

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,400
to at least express some emotions and

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,879
all of us that have dogs know that and

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,240
so Carl I'm going to take the weather

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,199
for a little bit and I'm going to set

30
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:16,519
you up for us to transition to Rich uh

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,320
uh so just a little bit about the

32
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,280
weather as we normally do soil's cool

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,519
right as we've seen a cooling pattern on

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,680
the weather we're also seeing some

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,478
cooling happening uh in the soils right

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,840
it was really pushing warm and really

37
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,959
the only places that are warm left are

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,680
down where riches and along the Metro

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:40,078
New York area uh along the coast oh let

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,880
me see sorry about that um and of course

41
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,478
that represents how much it was cooler

42
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,560
than normal last week uh we've been on a

43
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,319
warming Trend over in general and but

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,240
cooler than normal means it's been

45
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,879
cooler than we'd expect it to be over

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,599
the last 30 years particularly Inland

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,438
warmer to the north and a little bit

48
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:02,438
more to the South now this is allowing

49
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,919
us to still be ahead uh of last year and

50
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,559
I think for people that go year to year

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,719
uh seeing how far we are ahead of last

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,239
year um but also recognizing we're right

53
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,560
around normal most of the region based

54
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,640
on the 30-year average is normal and I

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,640
think climate change makes these things

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,000
a little bit more difficult to really

57
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,238
interpret and get a feel for right

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,840
because as as we've been warming so

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,680
significantly over the last two decades

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,319
you know what's normal is not as easy to

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,879
understand as maybe it used to be it's

62
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,399
very interesting we had our conference

63
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:37,079
call this morning and we had people

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,439
talking about how dry it was and then

65
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,040
all of a sudden boom we had people

66
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,719
talking about how wet it was uh and I

67
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,079
think uh you know what you see is

68
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,560
there's widespread drying if you drew a

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,440
line from Pittsburgh to Boston you'd see

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,158
in a couple hundred mile radi uh

71
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,479
diameter of that width of that you'd see

72
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:59,639
a really big dry Trend the last week but

73
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,679
other places almost everybody else got

74
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,479
about about an inch of rain so there was

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,519
a real split in in the moisture across

76
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,039
the region now Carl here's something I

77
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,000
want to talk to you about this is uh a

78
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,679
lomy soil uh this is the lawn watering

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,439
tool this is a lomy soil uh down in the

80
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,719
Metro New York area over over the last

81
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,639
month right so I think I put the pin in

82
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,318
Central Park or something like that

83
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,518
right so I'm looking at this thing and I

84
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:28,238
got a normal native soil like Zack Hol

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,599
would have at Central Park right so I'm

86
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,000
looking at this thing and my first

87
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,318
thought is I'm not sure I would have

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,639
watered once in the last month because

89
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,280
while I did have you know let me get the

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,919
pencil here for those watching us I did

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,199
have three days where I was in some

92
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,719
severe as we're defining it now stress

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,839
another day where it touched it maybe a

94
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,359
couple days we're in it couple of days

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,560
more I'm in it but what I've noticed

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,480
Carl is I'm always coming out of it

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,158
right I'm not really persistent in a way

98
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,639
and it looks like I'm going to come out

99
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:08,158
of it again uh this coming week now

100
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,438
moisture is the conversation as we reach

101
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,239
the summer solstice right when the soil

102
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,000
when the sun is highest in the sky and

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
we get the most ET when you're looking

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,160
at this are you seeing what I'm seeing

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,959
that maybe I wouldn't have irrigated my

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,759
lawn in the last month yeah I think I

107
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,079
agree with you Frank I haven't seen the

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,280
visible stress like that may be

109
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,719
indicated on on this model and part of

110
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,279
that is the model is based on these m

111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,919
maximum allowable deficits so basically

112
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,679
you know you have your Field capacity

113
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,719
and then if you drop that down 70% in

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,400
theory that's when we might expect some

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,880
stress um but I think our model early in

116
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,879
the season doesn't is probably over

117
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,680
predicting that stress like uh we had a

118
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,319
nice amount of moisture this whole

119
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,199
spring like like you've said on our

120
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,918
conference call this morning man it's

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,879
it's felt wet right and maybe part of

122
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,240
that is the the root depth is really

123
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,759
deep too so we have we have our rooting

124
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,800
depth from the spring rooting uh so Our

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,720
Roots can access a larger column of

126
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,520
water and when we get into this you know

127
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,080
quote unquote severe plant stress phase

128
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,198
in the model hey maybe our Our Roots are

129
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,879
actually deeper than this model is is

130
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,319
estimating so we're not actually seeing

131
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,918
stress when we predict it now if we pick

132
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,159
up this this hot and dry spell that

133
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,839
we're going to have move it into late

134
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,160
August or September when we've lost

135
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,279
rooting depth that's when I think we'll

136
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,039
start to see this severe stress actually

137
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,758
play out versus

138
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,639
yeah and because you know the soil

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,479
moisture thing is the fascinating part

140
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,079
and it's not just soil moisture but it's

141
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,918
soil where that where that rooting is

142
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,879
okay so this is good to know because on

143
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,639
the model if you go to the website

144
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,199
you'll actually see if you were setting

145
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,600
it and forgetting it starting in May 1

146
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,240
you would have put a fair amount of

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,600
water down already four inches or so in

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,120
the last month and and really not needed

149
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,039
it and that's the kind of thing I think

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,680
we're trying to drive here with this

151
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,318
model now as as Carl mentioned and we

152
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,879
know the Heat is going to be building

153
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,680
this is the 18th so you can see it's

154
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,120
coming uh across the uh region uh next

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,319
week this is where we have high

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,319
temperatures that persist and high

157
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,240
humidity that persists in the evening

158
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,479
now soon as you start talking about high

159
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,160
temperature and high humidity uh Carl

160
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,560
we're talking about diseases but it

161
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,160
looks like brown patch in particular is

162
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,399
confined to the southern end uh of the

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,919
region now I know you've got a rant

164
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,598
about this uh with regard to pesticide

165
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,279
use and this will be a perfect setup for

166
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:35,519
our Our Guest today go ahead Carl yeah

167
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,638
so so one of the thing when I first

168
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,359
started working you with you Frank I'd

169
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,478
go to these conferences and I wanted to

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,759
learn about how we apply pesticides you

171
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,598
know disease life cycles and I was in a

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,319
seminar at the gcsaa show and um Bruce

173
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,399
Clark was going through all the cultural

174
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,039
practices for you know dollar spot

175
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,399
prevention or a brown patch or

176
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,240
anthracnose and spends a lot of time on

177
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,959
the cultural practices the irrigation

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
the

179
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,120
fertility and uh there were no questions

180
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,639
from the group and then finally at the

181
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,478
end where we get to chemical control ho

182
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,120
baby the chem the the questions come

183
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,959
flooding in and I was marking them down

184
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,038
like oh my God there's 20 questions on

185
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,159
chemicals and none on the cultural

186
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,800
control um and just I think that sort of

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
uh mentality is what people end up sort

188
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,879
of getting into in the turf industry and

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
and it makes sense right we need

190
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,360
pesticides Frank you you studied this at

191
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,038
Beth Page black when we manag golf

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,479
courses this is a picture of I think the

193
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,639
the blue or the green course here but we

194
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,598
need pesticides in some uh quantity to

195
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,639
manage golf courses that's just how it

196
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,800
is in in at least in in Long Island the

197
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,639
amount of pesticides we need that

198
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,520
changes based on our expectations right

199
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,360
and when we did some work with the guys

200
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,279
at Wisconsin that was the main question

201
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,800
was what drives overall pesticide use on

202
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,158
golf courses is it the soils is it the

203
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,280
turf grass varieties is it the growing

204
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:56,158
conditions and what we found was it's

205
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,878
the budget and in effect it's the

206
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,079
expectations when you expect more at a

207
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,560
golf course when your members $50,000 to

208
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,439
get initiated into that golf course they

209
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,839
are going to expect a blemish free golf

210
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,158
course and you will use more pesticides

211
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,638
so when you spend more you spray more

212
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,918
that's the governor of pesticide use and

213
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,879
specifically when we look at the parts

214
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,560
of the golf course that that make up so

215
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,240
the majority of that pesticide use it's

216
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,038
the large areas it's the fairways large

217
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,598
scale rough applications that will

218
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,878
really drive that overall total and it's

219
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,240
interesting when we look at pesticide

220
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,960
records from a mom and pop course the

221
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,918
greens are not a whole lot different

222
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,559
from some of the those high-end places

223
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,559
but they don't spray the fairways and a

224
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,478
high-end Place sprays the fairways 10

225
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,958
times or 12 times and that's really what

226
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,479
shoots up uh those pesticide numbers now

227
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,319
when we zoomed out we got pesticide

228
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
records from different areas of the

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,640
country we expected different sort of

230
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,000
levels of pesticide use and when you

231
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,159
look at Texas or Florida or the Midwest

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,919
compared to us up here in the Northeast

233
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,838
man pesticide use wasn't that different

234
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,719
across the United States and we expected

235
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,839
more from the climates right hey maybe

236
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,759
different climates different

237
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,160
temperatures different growing season

238
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,439
lengths would change pesticide use in

239
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,000
the US it's about the same uh but when

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,240
we got records from other countries

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,600
courses in Denmark or Norway or the UK

242
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,278
wow they use a lot less pesticides and

243
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,240
that's probably not because of climate

244
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,320
it's probably because of the regulatory

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,240
climate right they have access to way

246
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,800
fewer pesticides we're talking easily in

247
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,000
order of magnitude fewer pesticides and

248
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,719
that restricts their ability to apply

249
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,720
them and you and Ben talked on the show

250
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,040
last week about some of the regulations

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,399
here in New York the birds and bees Bill

252
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,159
uh and and Neo Nick band and yeah I

253
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,039
think our turf industry gets really sort

254
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,919
of defensive about those and and last

255
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,399
week you guys talked really well about

256
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,759
the science behind hey maybe in Turf

257
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,879
neoni aren't that bad but in seedco

258
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,759
treatments yeah there is there is a high

259
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,958
risk to pollinators and it's tough when

260
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,000
the science isn't sort of leading the

261
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,799
the legislative approach um but but

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,559
often we'll get defensive whether the

263
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,919
science is leading or not and you know

264
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,278
the Spider-Man meme you're pointing uh

265
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,879
our industry likes to point the fingers

266
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,039
at hey hey we're doing good what about

267
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,519
that one over there uh and so we've

268
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,599
looked at this a little bit you know the

269
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,399
a will you know we'll point to a a will

270
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,800
point to golf courses as excessive users

271
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,240
uh and we looked at some pesticide

272
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,359
records as part of that research a

273
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,799
couple years ago and man golf course

274
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,200
turf is is about uh equal with with

275
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,240
great production in terms of our

276
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,640
pesticide use uh apples see we see more

277
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,799
pesticide use in and apple orchards and

278
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,360
potatoes holy smokes paint it white

279
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,679
sleep at night we talk about that they

280
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,560
use chlorthal a bunch in in potato

281
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,838
production so we we can do some of that

282
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,759
but I think what I come back to is is

283
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,680
one of my mentors and Frank you spent a

284
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,278
lot of time with her Jennifer Grant

285
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,519
would really always just look inward

286
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,439
right and instead of pointing the finger

287
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,639
at other people really asking the

288
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,399
question she'd be very direct with

289
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,079
superintendent why do you do that do you

290
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,759
need that like why did you spray that

291
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,638
thing uh and if someone couldn't explain

292
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,958
themselves she like well what the heck

293
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,839
right why why did you do that if you

294
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,879
can't explain why you did it do you

295
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,399
really need that uh and I think this is

296
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,039
a good question to ask and I ask this

297
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,159
all the time of myself is you know do I

298
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,360
need to be doing this and if I can come

299
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,439
up with a good reason and I can

300
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,159
rationalize it when we talk about and

301
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,639
you guys will talk about Disease Control

302
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,039
probably here in a bit um you need to

303
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,600
sort of be able to diagnose the disease

304
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,919
maybe you send it to Rich and Rich says

305
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,480
yes you have X Y and Z you need to treat

306
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,159
this hey I need that but when you can't

307
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,399
really sort of rationalize that and

308
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,078
that's the great part about Chen and her

309
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,519
IPM background was was if you can't

310
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,319
rationalize it why why are you wasting

311
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,720
your time on it and was that time and

312
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,600
and and money better spent on on

313
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,920
something else well here yeah and I

314
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,600
think Carl this is really the perfect

315
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,958
transition to the conversation when we

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,839
talk about why because this just you

317
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:57,799
know everybody learns this in some form

318
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,600
of pathology that you have a pathogen a

319
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,599
susceptible host and all your waiting

320
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,839
for is the suitable environment unless

321
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,759
you know you expect something to blow in

322
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,519
like a cutworm an army worm or or a gray

323
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,078
leaf spot that blows in maybe it it's

324
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,240
waiting for the host too but in general

325
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,198
you're you're waiting for the conducive

326
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,079
environment and of course we talked

327
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,599
about this Carl as you said in the past

328
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,519
and Rich you were involved in this

329
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,959
research many years ago when we were

330
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,120
using your records and other diagnostic

331
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:30,239
records to just determine when are

332
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,919
samples coming in what kinds of Trends

333
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,039
are we seeing what does our model say uh

334
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,639
this was back in early days you know we

335
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,519
were again much younger men so we've

336
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,759
seen a shift in in seasonal things uh

337
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,000
for sure but just to bring you in Rich I

338
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,600
don't know everybody knows you're a

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,440
biker riding you're how many miles

340
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,399
thousand 10,000 miles a year how many

341
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,480
are you doing now a year uh yeah about

342
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,320
around 10,000 a year um and that's I'm

343
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,680
down now I'm old I need a little more

344
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,079
rest yeah

345
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,198
and of course you just attended the the

346
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,638
dead at the sphere which I know you're

347
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,479
you know you're avidly enjoying live

348
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,519
music but at the same time I notic is

349
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,639
also when you were a younger man you're

350
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,078
you're you're well uh supported by

351
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,600
Sabrina in the Diagnostic lab so big

352
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,919
shout out to all the diagnostic people

353
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
and here's our questions for today Rich

354
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,919
all right we've been to working together

355
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,920
a really long time right and I'm sort of

356
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,039
curious about the trends over the last

357
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,719
20 years and you you know uh you are

358
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,759
dependent on samples coming in so people

359
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,519
understand that and of course you know

360
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,838
your institution uh Murphy and and Clark

361
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,959
did that anthracnose work many years ago

362
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,519
and I'm sure you know you are getting a

363
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,799
lot more samples before they identified

364
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,799
you got to put a little bit more

365
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,559
nitrogen you got to watch your growth

366
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,679
Regulators you got to sand a little bit

367
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:59,119
do you get as many an anthros samples

368
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,039
how much have your Diagnostics changed

369
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,240
based on some of the research that's

370
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,559
been done to maybe help guys identify

371
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,919
things themselves a little bit better

372
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,919
let's talk about that well that's a

373
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:15,639
great it's a great question and anthros

374
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:19,958
is an excellent example of how uh uh

375
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:24,000
research can solve problems you know uh

376
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:27,039
uh we used to I guess it was

377
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,159
2001 um the number of anthros samples

378
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,439
that I would get was about 36 % of the

379
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,759
Total Turf

380
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,519
samples and you know it was

381
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:43,199
somewhere around 200 a year um last

382
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:46,679
season um we got 14 anthract no samples

383
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,758
you know so so it pretty it pretty much

384
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,719
wrecked the business for us as

385
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,639
diagnosticians because if you follow the

386
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,560
guidelines you know and it was a decade

387
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,759
or so of of research by a whole bunch of

388
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,159
really good Pathologists yeah um

389
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,919
uh it eliminates the the risk for that

390
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,278
particular disease and and we just don't

391
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,519
get the samples now okay okay so

392
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,720
research uh undermines your business

393
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,759
model which I think is a good uh point

394
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,040
to remember um but I'm also interested

395
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,560
maybe in what you see uh with the

396
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,278
superintendents that do submit samples

397
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,758
or that you speak with because you're on

398
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,799
the road chatting a fair amount and you

399
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,079
know Carl and I and you've been involved

400
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,240
in our forecast models here at Cornell

401
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,638
we we as Carl have said they're all

402
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,278
wrong but they're useful I'm wondering

403
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,759
how much you see about that and also how

404
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,639
much how much is there more spraying

405
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,680
going on than there used to be uh and is

406
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,639
that related to different products or is

407
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:48,599
it related to being a little bit more

408
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,519
averse to risk uh you know like what

409
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,319
we've talked about recently that how

410
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,799
people have decided they need to spray

411
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,120
preventatively eight times for pythium

412
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,120
root rot uh what kind of Behavioral

413
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,519
changes have you seen among super

414
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,240
tenants over the last bunch of years

415
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,159
well that that's a great question and uh

416
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,440
a lot of times I think that those of us

417
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,039
in this side of the business are more

418
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,199
like psychiatrists or psychologists than

419
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,480
uh

420
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:20,399
Pathologists um you know uh guys

421
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,440
depending on where they are and we talk

422
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,360
about the higher end and bigger budgets

423
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,720
mean more sprays are still spraying

424
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:33,440
quite a bit you know I remember in the

425
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,240
uh uh the Heyday of anthros that many

426
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,160
superintendant would spray on four or

427
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,839
five day intervals even you know not

428
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,120
knowing they needed to fertilize and

429
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,759
that would have solved their problem um

430
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:49,278
but but it's not uncommon to

431
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:53,800
see um weekly fungicide treatments on

432
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,078
greens and teas today um and and and it

433
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,399
it's interesting I don't think they

434
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:02,318
spray more um but the risk aversion is

435
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,919
higher you know moving from the high end

436
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:08,438
to the lowend even the mid-range and

437
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:12,240
lower end guys um are getting pressure

438
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,600
for higher quality grass so they spray

439
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,679
more and and and then you know to kind

440
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,279
of roll this in too there's a lot more

441
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,798
chemistry there's a lot of chemicals now

442
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,558
you know it's remarkable really what

443
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:30,319
I've seen come to Market in the last 30

444
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,480
years that we didn't have when I started

445
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,000
and and they're and they may be softer

446
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,519
and not as persistent and that might be

447
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,798
why we're spraying

448
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:42,400
weekly yeah maybe I but I still think

449
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,839
you know if you're spraying on 14 days

450
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,519
that's pretty darn good coverage you

451
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,119
know so you don't need a fungicide that

452
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:54,240
that knocks the crap out of a fungus you

453
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:56,319
know for maybe 21 or 28 days before it

454
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
recovers its growth you don't need to

455
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,119
spray it every seven days so even the

456
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,360
most risk averse person at 14 days is

457
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:08,158
still covering really well all right so

458
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,798
let's let's stay on the uh pythium root

459
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,559
rot thing because this has really been

460
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,960
in my craw and I know I I banter with

461
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,678
Carl all the time about this and I think

462
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,960
it's come up recently is there a thought

463
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,519
among Pathologists that maybe we

464
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,319
shouldn't be spraying for pythium root r

465
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,639
i mean listen let's let's make sure

466
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,439
everybody understands what we're talking

467
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,960
about when you have saturated root zones

468
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,240
and you have stress Turf to begin with

469
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,279
cut low you know you know a lot of

470
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,880
traffic um you get these wet conditions

471
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,960
uh it doesn't even have to be hot I

472
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,640
don't think right Rich you'll get

473
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,840
pythium root rod in those anerobic

474
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,280
conditions right yeah yeah and temp

475
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,759
temperature doesn't matter at all I mean

476
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:52,000
going back to Eric Nelson you know in in

477
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:54,919
1990 you know he was talking about

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,279
pathogenicity at 40 degrees you know and

479
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,880
causing root infections with some of the

480
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:03,240
same pathogens that cause iium blight on

481
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,520
the foliage you know at 80 degrees so so

482
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,640
uh you know super saturated soils poor

483
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,960
internal drainage extra rain all that

484
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,038
creates a condition for this or these

485
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,240
organisms because they're algae you know

486
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,038
they're not really true fungi but uh you

487
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,079
know I don't think everybody needs to be

488
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,720
spraying I think I think you need to be

489
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,199
fixing your drainage or your irrigation

490
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,400
protocol or you know something like that

491
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,400
I think you're going to get more Bang

492
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,880
from your buck from from that then

493
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,519
starting to spray at 50 degrees or 55

494
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,679
degrees and spraying all

495
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:40,359
season but you're seeing it more and

496
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,960
more we we yeah we see we see uh uh a

497
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:45,798
more preventive pythium root rot

498
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,960
applications and I think you know down

499
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,200
south you know uh North Carolina South

500
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,000
Carolina you know maybe there's more

501
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,600
call for it um and and some of the

502
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,558
programs that come out of the Southern

503
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:04,480
researchers um might work well down

504
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:08,519
there but may be excessive up here okay

505
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,079
okay so so I don't I I I'm gonna go I'm

506
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:15,038
gonna uh go a little bit further with

507
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:18,038
this um they are more risk averse uh

508
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,879
they seem every even at the mid and low

509
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,200
level they're expect everybody's

510
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,080
expecting higher quality conditions

511
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,840
right so they're having to spray more um

512
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,558
I'm

513
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,439
wondering just my sarc fastic view as

514
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,079
you know from working with me a long

515
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,720
time I was very surprised with the rash

516
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,720
of nematode concerns we had years ago

517
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,640
that seemed to be well timed with the

518
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,880
release of new nematicides from two big

519
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,000
chemical companies I thought that was a

520
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,840
very interesting correlation causation

521
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,599
uh situation going on and I'm wondering

522
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:58,000
about the the regular visits that our

523
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,879
distributor reps make to our clientele

524
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,400
uh maybe saying boy you should probably

525
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,039
get that uh pythium root Rod I'm not

526
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,960
suggesting impropriety but I'm

527
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,240
suggesting more is it you're thought

528
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,400
maybe superintendant are barged a little

529
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,359
bit with these things uh that might be a

530
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,080
concern and that drives their use a

531
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:22,158
little bit um yes yes

532
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:24,558
I I uh uh um be careful now because yeah

533
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,440
I know joh might be two people listening

534
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,399
I don't want to throw anybody under the

535
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,400
bus but uh yeah they're there's a lot

536
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,200
there's a lot of that look there's two

537
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:39,759
there's two things I see you know new

538
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:41,919
product and uh uh uh uh you know the the

539
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,319
marketing push for the new products

540
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,600
right um the other thing is

541
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,240
superintendant who are so busy with

542
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:54,000
multiple

543
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,159
tasks you know Personnel problems greens

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,480
Comm you know um basically saying to the

545
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,080
sales reps just sell me what you think I

546
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,120
need you know and and that way they

547
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,158
don't have to really think about it in

548
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,079
the way we would want them to from an

549
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,919
IPM you know from from Jennifer Grant's

550
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:14,240
standpoint you know uh uh and so so they

551
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,080
get into

552
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
program programs that may have been

553
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,278
worked out by a research scientist that

554
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,000
are picked up by the companies and they

555
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:27,278
might not need any of it you know

556
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,319
and okay all right so so so we'll end

557
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:32,720
this part with being thought F right and

558
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,759
as we're more thoughtful um there

559
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,919
appears to be some new things on the

560
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:41,359
horizon um what is this new pathogen

561
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,278
from uh John uad at Yukon that I know

562
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,199
you're talking about that you've been me

563
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,720
talking about and also this morning you

564
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,360
commented as you hang out with molecular

565
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,679
biologists like Ming ye your new uh turf

566
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,918
grass pathologist who replaced Dr Clark

567
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,440
uh they're sort of throwing a wrench in

568
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,320
the whole pathogen ID thing we so do we

569
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,038
really know what we thought we know or

570
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:10,000
we don't know what we don't know well

571
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:12,038
um yeah it's it's become more confusing

572
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,599
because you know now with with the

573
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:18,038
ability to to sequence the the genes of

574
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:21,000
these organisms were starting to see

575
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:23,480
differences you know and and so uh it

576
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,798
was just to start with a new pathogen uh

577
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,000
that John's looking at um and that's new

578
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,960
I can't even we can't name it John

579
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,079
suggest a name and mingi did some work

580
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,720
with the same pathogen and they said

581
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,480
that the matches they're getting are

582
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,519
aren't close enough to to know what this

583
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,558
is so it's something new you know okay

584
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,440
so so this is good because we don't have

585
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,399
a lot of time left and I know this can

586
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,519
be a very lengthy conversation is it

587
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,038
academic or are these species

588
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,639
potentially going to relate to the need

589
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,200
for different control measures well I

590
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,679
that there's two answers is for that

591
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,000
depending on which one it could be

592
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,880
academic you know uh uh the John John's

593
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,079
pathogen looks a lot like brown ring

594
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,799
patch you know or wadia patch and we

595
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:15,798
know DMI fungicides work really well for

596
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:18,879
wadia and uh DMI fungicides John said to

597
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:21,000
name one Max thema works really well you

598
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,799
know so maybe we're we're we don't we

599
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,119
just realize it's A New Path because

600
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:28,720
John looked a little closer one time you

601
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:30,599
know okay so so that's that um the other

602
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,038
the other issue is with these root

603
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,158
infecting patch diseases you know we

604
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,879
both know course that was having trouble

605
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,320
with their summer patch control that's

606
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,880
right that's right and I would always

607
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,079
suggest to them that it was timing um

608
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,640
but what we found was it was a closely

609
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:48,199
related pathogen that wasn't

610
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:52,840
magnaporthiopsis this uh um SL

611
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,720
slopes oh God and uh and so that

612
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,839
pathogen has been implicated as the

613
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,798
cause of take all and bent grass you

614
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:06,558
know in Canada and and so so what what

615
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:10,079
we're finding is um that pathogen grows

616
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,879
at a lower soil temperature right so so

617
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:16,398
we are missing the timing but we should

618
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,200
have started at 55 degrees not 65

619
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:21,759
degrees and so so so we're finding that

620
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,960
in POA we're finding it in bent grass

621
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,759
we're also finding this magnaporthiopsis

622
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,919
myai that's supposed to be in fine

623
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,440
fescues

624
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,559
in POA on putting greens that are

625
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,159
telling me the same story right so

626
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,440
so figuring out exactly which one of

627
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,320
these and M mingi says to me he says if

628
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,640
they get good control at 65 degrees then

629
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:49,000
it's magnaporthiopsis if they don't tell

630
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,000
them to start at 55

631
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,159
degrees okay so this is go we bantered

632
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,439
around just calling it like the summer

633
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,440
patch syndrome because there's multiple

634
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,600
pathogens here and we're we still have a

635
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,880
little bit to to learn this is great but

636
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,158
on the other hand coming back full

637
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,840
circle um it seems like Diagnostics are

638
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,278
still going to play an important role

639
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,759
because we're going to have new

640
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:18,159
pathogens right and if people become

641
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,519
thoughtful right and are interested um

642
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,640
you know they can take samples do I have

643
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,519
pythium root rot that I have to worry

644
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,360
about uh here you're going to find

645
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:29,599
pythium everywhere uh there is still a

646
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,918
role for people to send samples in no

647
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,959
one's sending you good Turf but if

648
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,559
they're having trouble with their root

649
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,600
pathogens uh this seems to be something

650
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,200
that remains difficult to diagnose that

651
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,319
it'd be really good to get it in

652
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,840
professional hands wouldn't you say I I

653
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,839
I would say and and you know uh uh we

654
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,599
can look at it and and you know I'm a

655
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,879
classically trained pathologist you know

656
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,398
I was trained 30 something years ago so

657
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,840
I look at morphology and all the old

658
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:59,558
school stuff and to partner with the

659
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,199
guys that have the new technology you

660
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:05,519
know uh uh so what we're trying to do is

661
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,080
bring in some of these these uh uh uh

662
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,519
newer uh uh Technologies in order to

663
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,398
separate this stuff and so we're going

664
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,519
to start offering molecular

665
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,398
characterization of these root patches

666
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,278
through the lab you know the problem is

667
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,839
you know I can tell you in like 20

668
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:27,000
minutes takes Ming a month you know to

669
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:30,639
get to isolate and do all that work so

670
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
so you know change right they'll develop

671
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,520
assays I would imagine over time won't

672
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,960
they yeah I think so I mean there's

673
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,119
there's stuff that's quicker you know

674
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,120
and and I think once they get get a

675
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:44,319
clear picture of what we're looking at

676
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,079
then they'll start working on speed and

677
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,439
you know in my lab it's always about

678
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,639
quick and dirty what can you do fast

679
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,320
right and and uh uh it'll get to that

680
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,240
you know because in other crop systems

681
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:58,200
and other pathogens they're already

682
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,200
there so so we're going to get there too

683
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,759
all right well Carl do we have anything

684
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,679
for our fine guest here we have no we

685
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,519
have no gifts this ain't the Price Is

686
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,600
Right so all we got is the gift is just

687
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,839
being here with you guys the points are

688
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,599
made up what is it the points are made

689
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,398
made up and the scores don't matter

690
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,918
that's right rich rich one question I

691
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,119
had was um I don't see a whole lot of

692
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:27,159
people testing things on their Nursery

693
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,639
areas or their um you know Skip areas

694
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,480
check plots I don't see a whole lot of

695
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,559
that and I wonder how often do you

696
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,079
recommend that for people who are

697
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,558
spraying a lot of things and maybe

698
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,000
you'll look at their program and go I

699
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,038
don't know if you need this do people

700
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,599
play around enough on areas to the side

701
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:45,278
that they have experimental areas Dan

702
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,480
denelli comes to mind as a guy who's

703
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,558
done this with varieties and root zones

704
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,159
yeah well you know what you see a little

705
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,519
bit of that but mostly the press the

706
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:59,240
risk aversion you know nobody's willing

707
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:02,159
to even throw down a piece of paper yeah

708
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,960
right it's like you know and and it's

709
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,120
we've been teaching this sort of stuff

710
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,319
you know uh uh treatment evaluations

711
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,398
forever you know we're treat we're

712
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,720
teaching modeling we're we're we're

713
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:18,798
teaching mindful decision PRI Precision

714
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,360
applications and uh Underneath It All I

715
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:25,480
think is this the the risk averse High

716
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,759
salary has to be perfect and it's still

717
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,038
driving everything guys in the field do

718
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,319
yeah top down stress is is certainly

719
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:34,038
what well it's a cultural thing I mean

720
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,398
what D what we're talking about here is

721
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,519
a cultural thing it's it's it's the

722
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,319
expectations are human derived science

723
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,839
and the climate don't determine

724
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,759
expectations it's not a first principle

725
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,240
it's it's humans deciding that needs to

726
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,000
be perfect and and their willingness to

727
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,960
pay for it I think that's the other part

728
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,319
of this none of this is happening if

729
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,278
there not willingness to pay for it so

730
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,519
it also is the economics that g is doing

731
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:02,480
pretty good especially golf these days

732
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,278
but I would see I even see it in school

733
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,798
grounds you know they're willing to

734
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,398
spend money on Synthetic Turf uh there

735
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,200
you know more more grounds and

736
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:14,479
Landscapes want to be manicured not just

737
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,240
uh groomed uh and and sometimes they

738
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,880
worry about chemicals sometimes

739
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,159
sometimes they don't all right Carl are

740
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,000
we there we're there the fastest season

741
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,320
five of the Cornell Turf Show is is in

742
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,079
the books and maybe next season we'll

743
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,639
focus on people and not grass because

744
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:28,558
that's what it always comes down to

745
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,600
right it always comes down people as

746
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,240
much as you don't like interacting with

747
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,678
people it ends up uh there so thank you

748
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,159
everyone for those who've listened live

749
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,440
who watch the videos who who listen on

750
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,960
the podcast thank you a bunch yeah we

751
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,200
will definitely be back thanks Carl see

752
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,720
you rich good see talk to you next week

753
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,558
see you this has been a production of

754
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,558
