1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,010
you want to create a safe living

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,720
learning environment for the community

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:14,109
because the soil that we're trying to

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,849
develop it's actually the community so

5
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:18,998
you want to start with healthy soil a

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,448
healthy community so becoming a seed to

7
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:24,068
supper facilitator it's more than just

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,529
gardening it's about community

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:28,719
development it's about community

10
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:31,359
education it's about community

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,969
empowerment and in Parker Palmer's book

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,590
healing the heart of democracy the

13
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:37,509
courage to create a politics worthy of

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,850
the human spirit he talks about these

15
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:41,549
five habits of the heart

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,280
and these five habits

17
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,869
can be used as a road map to develop a

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,759
community garden but also to create a

19
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,858
community community rivers have to

20
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,498
understand that the community garden is

21
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,300
about everyone and the success of the

22
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:57,100
garden is about everyone and that we're

23
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,869
all in the gardening we're all in the

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,518
community together not one person sticks

25
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:02,709
out we have to stick together in order

26
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,689
to create our community but also it's an

27
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,969
appreciation of the value of everyone

28
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:09,390
everybody comes into a community

29
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:12,039
different everyone's story is different

30
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,540
everyone's food choice is different but

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,380
we have to address this to understand

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,360
appreciate that diversity but then also

33
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,699
with diversity comes tension in the

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,969
third habit of the heart is an ability

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,920
to hold tension in life-giving ways

36
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,829
tension can arise but there's a way to

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,290
use that tension and create a community

38
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,239
through tension and actually recycled

39
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,310
attention and devote that tension to

40
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,349
actually developing a community garden

41
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,359
developing community education efforts

42
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:42,459
around the garden but then the fourth

43
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,569
habit of the heart is a sense of

44
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:48,399
personal voice and agency when we honor

45
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,869
life when we honor people's agencies

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,880
when we honor their voices and their

47
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,490
personal backgrounds we create community

48
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,349
so for people who are going into

49
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,209
communities that are not used to the

50
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,769
process of being self reflexive has to

51
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,539
occur because you're gonna come up

52
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,939
against things that you're not used to

53
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,380
and you have to be sensitive to that

54
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,969
going to the fifth heaven of the heart

55
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:10,229
which is the capacity to create

56
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:13,060
community which is when we when we honor

57
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,000
life when we honor people's agencies

58
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,830
when we honor their voices and their

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,469
personal backgrounds we create community

60
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,380
but creating community is not a one-time

61
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:25,109
thing it's a continuous process it's a

62
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,579
process of recreating and rethinking and

63
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,580
reimagining where the community is

64
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,409
you
