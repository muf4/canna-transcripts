1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,460
okay this is a very common dog spot

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,280
injury that many people have around the

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,350
yard fairly easy to remedy the first

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,989
thing you want to do is is remove the

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,609
debris that's been burned from the dog's

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,710
urine and just get a rake and kind of

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,669
just dig yourself up here and you see

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,990
how nice and easy it comes up and you

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,130
can see we're a little bit for a little

10
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:31,469
grade here so I've got some compost here

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,439
from the backyard that we've got and

12
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,780
what I'm going to do is add a handful of

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,338
seed into my bucket I have just a little

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,198
bit of soil in about a handful of seed

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:47,039
and just mix it up and you should be

16
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:50,509
able to see plenty of seeds in there and

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,510
you start adding it to the hole

18
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:55,678
establishing a little bit of a of a

19
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:57,988
grade here now you want to establish

20
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,510
intimate contact between the seed and

21
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,388
soil so the seed can extract water from

22
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:07,939
the soil so you just get and step down a

23
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,939
little bit and you're all set
