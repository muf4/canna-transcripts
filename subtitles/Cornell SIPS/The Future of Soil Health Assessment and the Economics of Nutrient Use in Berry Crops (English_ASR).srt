1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,140
good afternoon everyone this is Laura

2
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,699
McDermott speaking on behalf of the

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,710
northeast ser funded soil management and

4
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,460
buried crops as a model for management

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,160
education project this is the 12th

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,530
webinar in a series of 12 the final

7
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,959
webinar so I really am happy that we've

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:47,058
got a good group and thank you for

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:50,768
logging on we I think most of you know

10
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:54,289
your way around this Adobe Connect

11
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:56,539
classroom you put a chat in that long

12
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,570
narrow box right in the lower center

13
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:02,210
that's how you communicate there are web

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,698
links here for the webinar archives in

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,489
case you've missed any and to Northeast

16
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:09,349
air and then just on the apparently

17
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:11,269
according to kathy there are a couple of

18
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:13,519
folks that have not finished the

19
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:16,310
Northeast air demographics questionnaire

20
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,929
we would really love everybody to do

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,790
that it's something that we need to have

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,500
done for the grant and I do there's

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,630
going to be more information about this

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,228
but this is concluding the first year of

25
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:32,149
this project the webinars are part of a

26
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:35,359
two-year northeast air professional

27
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:37,728
development project and we'll have more

28
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,930
information about the second year's work

29
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:44,688
at the end of this presentation and then

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,618
Cathy heidenreich will also discuss the

31
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:50,629
post-test and the webinar evaluation

32
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:54,019
that we'd like everyone to complete at

33
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:56,118
your leisure so without further ado I

34
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:59,239
think we'll we'll move into the second

35
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,569
phase the last educational presentation

36
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:05,390
of the webinar series dr. Harold Venice

37
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:07,279
it will be giving Harold as the

38
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,439
professor of soil modern management and

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,020
chair of the Department of crop and soil

40
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,000
Sciences at Cornell University his

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,740
current research and extension interests

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,879
are in precision management of nitrogen

43
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,200
soil health and space time statistics

44
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,539
and today he's going to be speaking

45
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,039
about soil management using ecological

46
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:32,560
principles and soil health management

47
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:34,568
all right here well thank you thank you

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,829
laura i hope you can all hear me good

49
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:41,729
day so in this final webinar I'd like to

50
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:43,480
kind of bring together some of the

51
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,438
management approaches that we've

52
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:49,539
discussed in the in the past months and

53
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:52,539
and perhaps think about it a little bit

54
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:55,328
more at a conceptual level especially

55
00:02:52,539 --> 00:03:00,519
how we can bring ecological principles

56
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:03,969
into into sustainable very management so

57
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,759
a little bit about agroecology miguel

58
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:08,680
Altieri defined it as the application of

59
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,840
ecological science to the study design

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,150
and management of sustainable

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:19,090
agriculture of course relates to how

62
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,870
organisms interact with with their

63
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,878
environment and even though agricultural

64
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,609
systems almost by definition are not

65
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,878
natural systems there's a lot we can

66
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:33,040
learn from natural systems and and

67
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:37,209
that's also applicable to agriculture

68
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,668
system it can enhance the agricultural

69
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,650
systems by basically mimicking some of

70
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,129
the natural processes especially how

71
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:49,209
various organisms interact so this could

72
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:52,418
be so organisms like worms or fungi or

73
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,209
bacteria it could be plants either our

74
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:58,419
berry plants which were primarily

75
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:01,269
concerned about or other plans that that

76
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:04,000
might interact with them like like maybe

77
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:08,099
cover crops or mulch or something like

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,568
that it the idea is that it encourages

79
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:14,228
beneficial biological interactions

80
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:16,870
synergies and efficiencies and that

81
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:20,259
recycles nutrients energy and carbon in

82
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,139
favor of external inputs where possible

83
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:25,329
and that it it kind of approaches

84
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,460
multiple tactics so with this this

85
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:30,008
latter point we we mean that you know we

86
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:32,939
tend to bring in a lot of external

87
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,740
inputs into agricultural systems and

88
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,408
most of the time that's necessary to

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,129
have the production potential that we're

90
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:41,649
looking for

91
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:44,528
but there's a lot of internal cycling

92
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:46,288
that we can take advantage of and it

93
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:48,939
really it's a it's a framework for

94
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:51,188
approaching agricultural management that

95
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,319
is really much more knowledge intensive

96
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:56,949
and in a way I think that's been the

97
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,588
purpose of the seminar where we where we

98
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:03,819
discussed a lot of approaches that are

99
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:08,348
not simple and there's often not very

100
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:11,080
easy prescriptive recipe type answers

101
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:13,838
but that need to be that need to bring

102
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,838
in basically our knowledge of the system

103
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:19,809
inis and and how the interactions within

104
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:24,278
the system occur so this graph here

105
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:27,279
shows five legs of a table that

106
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:29,918
represents natural ecosystems and and

107
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:32,829
these are basically represent five

108
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:36,128
characteristics of natural ecosystems

109
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:39,329
they tend to be self-regulating they

110
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:42,189
tend to be efficient they are diverse

111
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:45,009
they are generally self-sufficient and

112
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,409
they are resilient so let's look at

113
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,649
those in a little bit more detail so

114
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:51,728
when we think about a natural ecosystem

115
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,028
you know you have to keep in mind that

116
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:58,058
these systems have evolved over over the

117
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:59,499
years and and basically have come up

118
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:02,499
with with what you might want to call a

119
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:05,528
successful formula so they are they have

120
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:08,499
to be efficient in terms of energy in

121
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:10,928
terms of nutrients water and carbon and

122
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:14,159
they tend to cycle quite efficiently

123
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:16,838
within a natural ecosystem there's

124
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:20,800
typically very little waste because one

125
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:23,918
organisms waste is another's resource in

126
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,509
in agricultural systems we often have a

127
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:30,519
lot more waste and external losses like

128
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:33,879
for example nitrate leaching or runoff

129
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:36,788
that that would be wasteful in a natural

130
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,509
environment and and we have to minimize

131
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:43,868
those in in a more modest environment

132
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:47,069
they tend to be diverse above and below

133
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:50,649
ground biological activity or diversity

134
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,270
leads to checks and balances if we think

135
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,189
about soil organisms

136
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:57,279
we have been official ones we have

137
00:06:54,189 --> 00:07:00,550
pathogenic organisms and they tend to

138
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,779
keep each other in check above ground we

139
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,270
have different plant organisms that also

140
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,629
impact and compete with each other and

141
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:13,269
and basically provide a balance there

142
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:15,219
they tend to be self-sufficient the only

143
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:19,569
external inputs tend to beat sun light

144
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,820
rain and air and and not many of these

145
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:24,339
other external inputs that we normally

146
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:28,569
see in agricultural systems so they

147
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:30,609
evolved basically to be efficient and to

148
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,680
to basically take advantage of the

149
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,850
limited resources that they have

150
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,949
available they are self regulating they

151
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,740
have diverse o'clock ecological

152
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,019
communities and severe disease or pest

153
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,199
outbreaks tend to be uncommon again

154
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:49,449
because of this diversity and keeping

155
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,110
the checks and balances their

156
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:56,740
populations tend to be dynamic and

157
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:59,259
continuously influx and last but not

158
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,079
least they tend to be resilient you know

159
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:05,349
many natural systems have been subjected

160
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,479
to extreme events whether it may be

161
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,370
extreme precipitation like a hurricane

162
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:15,129
or or extreme cold or extreme dryness

163
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,040
and that way they've basically adapted

164
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:21,370
to those kind of environments and

165
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,710
they've built resiliency into their

166
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,019
ecosystems they can be damaged but they

167
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:30,849
tend to come back easily more easily

168
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:32,559
than than a damaged ecosystem so the

169
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,050
question then is which of these can we

170
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,759
achieve in agriculture and I think we

171
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,569
have to be realistic that that

172
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,289
agriculture by its very design is not

173
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:47,680
natural because we basically try to

174
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:50,709
favor one plant or berry crop in this

175
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,879
case over other plans but we can still

176
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,350
take advantage of a lot of the

177
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:58,149
principles of natural ecosystems so

178
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,909
let's start it maybe contrast that a

179
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:03,639
little bit to sort of the the more

180
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:04,149
conventional agricultural approach and

181
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:10,029
how

182
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:13,419
many of us have learned about managing

183
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,549
agricultural systems the most dominant

184
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,860
paradigm in agriculture is is more

185
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:20,799
reactive management short-term response

186
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,190
to immediate problems that relies on

187
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,589
external interventions and we have some

188
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,540
examples here for example if you're low

189
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,450
on nitrogen then you apply a nitrogen

190
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:33,219
fertilizer if you have an insect problem

191
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,470
then you apply an insecticide if you

192
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,540
have weedy conditions you apply an

193
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,200
herbicide if the soil is dry you

194
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:43,599
irrigate the soil is compacted you use a

195
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,030
subsoiler or something like that now

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,759
sometimes these problems can be symptoms

197
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:51,360
of deeper or more fundamental problems

198
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,759
maybe a poorly managed ecosystem and

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,279
this also tends to be a relatively short

200
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:00,129
term approach to things we might think

201
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,139
of in tilt systems we might think of

202
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:04,000
tillage that way as well that we have a

203
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,879
short-term benefit from tillage but in

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,269
the longer term we do damage to the to

205
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:15,330
the land now the two contrast that a

206
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:18,250
more agro ecological approach is more

207
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,770
proactive and looks more at the

208
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,500
long-term and the idea here is to

209
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:26,889
develop internal strength into the

210
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,080
system that allows it to be more

211
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,720
efficient more resilient and all those

212
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,050
qualities that we'd like to see in in

213
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,259
good agroecosystems so we like to use

214
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:40,839
strategies that enhance mutualism and

215
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,899
synergies you know many of the for

216
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:48,100
example of the soil biota can enhance

217
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:50,740
plant growth mycorrhizae are one example

218
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,850
of that we'd like to be able to stress

219
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,379
the pest and enhance the beneficials and

220
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,060
create soil and above ground conditions

221
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,570
that promote growth of healthy crops

222
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:04,119
with enhanced defenses and the analogy

223
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,210
that I often use when I talk to students

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,620
or or stakeholders is is the analogy

225
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,690
with human health which we've used

226
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,080
before and when you think about

227
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,270
proactive long-term management it's the

228
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,720
analogy would be to basically live a

229
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,100
healthy lifestyle

230
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,050
to to eat healthy say a high-fiber diet

231
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:29,600
with fruits and vegetables not too much

232
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:32,719
meat and to exercise and and and

233
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,610
basically live all the live a lifestyle

234
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,189
that's that's low of stress that

235
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:41,930
basically gives you internal strength

236
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:44,469
and health in your body the contrast

237
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:47,359
there in terms of the more reactive

238
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,949
management would be more like getting

239
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,169
sick or say getting a bacterial

240
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:53,479
infection and taking antibiotics and

241
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,938
there's nothing wrong with that it's

242
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,829
good to do that at the time but what you

243
00:11:55,938 --> 00:12:00,379
also like to do is you'd like to be able

244
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:03,948
to to build that strength into the

245
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:06,379
system over the long term so when you

246
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:10,399
think about the human health you know

247
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:12,789
eating a healthy meal eating a salad or

248
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,068
eating some fruits and vegetables or

249
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:18,438
some high fiber breakfast doesn't

250
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,559
overnight make you into a healthy person

251
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:24,828
you need to have a long term commitment

252
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:27,888
to good diet and exercise to become

253
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:30,469
healthy and to build the strength in the

254
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:33,528
in your in your body to be able to

255
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:36,649
withstand a diversity of conditions so

256
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:38,778
the analogy is really very similar you

257
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:42,740
want to focus on on at least having a

258
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:46,000
long-term strategy in managing your

259
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:50,379
ecosystem your aegyo ecosystem to reduce

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,909
the the susceptibility to stress and

261
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:56,688
build resiliency and strength in the

262
00:12:52,909 --> 00:13:00,429
system so that's basically captured in

263
00:12:56,688 --> 00:13:03,919
this graph that you can see here and

264
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:05,929
there's basically three components the

265
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,838
first is this long term preventive

266
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:11,179
management the second is a little bit

267
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,050
more shorter term sort of seasonal

268
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:17,409
management and then the third one is the

269
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:21,019
real short term reactive management and

270
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:23,448
so if we if you look at the start with

271
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:25,578
the preventive management we can think

272
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:28,399
of sort of an aboveground component and

273
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:30,289
a below-ground component so let's start

274
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,370
with that with the latter if we think

275
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:33,709
about you

276
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,690
building healthy soils these are some of

277
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,150
the management practices that we

278
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,250
discussed earlier start out with

279
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:44,689
assessing your soil try to improve the

280
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:49,039
soil even before you you plant your your

281
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:53,210
berries make sure that the pH is

282
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:56,169
corrected at organic matter 22 to build

283
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:59,120
up the the carbon levels in the soils

284
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:01,120
reduce compaction problems all those

285
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,649
kind of things that are sort of

286
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,429
preventative longer term management

287
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:11,059
approaches we think about above-ground

288
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:13,338
good crop selection you know select

289
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,979
varieties that are resistant to certain

290
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,680
diseases make sure that they are planted

291
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:22,070
well things like that that basically

292
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:25,189
will enhance the success of your of your

293
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,690
plant so this then we'll create soil and

294
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,050
above ground conditions for healthy

295
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,930
plants with enhanced defenses so a

296
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:35,629
second level then you might think of

297
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:37,969
sort of in season management and this is

298
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:40,549
more sort of planned in season

299
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,310
management think in terms of integrated

300
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:46,370
pest management so you basically you

301
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:50,028
commit to a set of practices that help

302
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,179
you better manage plus pests and you're

303
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:55,629
in your crops for example you commit to

304
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:58,849
two weekly field inspections and

305
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:01,370
scouting that you know you could look

306
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:05,870
for diseases you could look for insects

307
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,490
you could also do some soil measurements

308
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,639
you can maybe keep track of the nitrate

309
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,730
levels you can do tissue testing things

310
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,269
like that that on a regular basis is a

311
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,039
commitment to monitoring your crop and

312
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,049
then finally you may need to do some

313
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,719
reactive management you may need to

314
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:26,949
apply a pesticide but it's organic or

315
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,589
inorganic you may need to correct some

316
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:33,440
nutrient problems and so this is sort of

317
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,060
the the immediate response again going

318
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,400
back to the human health that's more

319
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:40,219
like taking some antibiotics or taking

320
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,519
some cold medicine so that you on the

321
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,550
short-term can reduce the impact so in a

322
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,088
way what we have

323
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:52,879
is a range of of management approaches

324
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:55,140
that we have to use to optimize our crop

325
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,120
what we need to keep in mind is that we

326
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,458
have tended to focus more on the

327
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,959
reactive management but we need to make

328
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:06,929
sure that we plan ahead of time starting

329
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:10,078
with a site identification and site

330
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:13,828
remediation to also do it a long term

331
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,929
preventative management I just wanted to

332
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:17,909
show you an example of this and this

333
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:20,250
actually relates to corn production in

334
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:22,649
Kenya but i think it's it's a very

335
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,500
interesting results from a study from a

336
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,899
few years ago by marina and barrett and

337
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,110
they are basically a agriculture

338
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,769
economist here at cornell and what they

339
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,980
did is they looked at nitrogen response

340
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:40,139
on lands that had a range of organic

341
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,600
matter content or carbon content and

342
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,240
this is in western kenya where some

343
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,339
soils have been in production for maybe

344
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,278
a hundred years and they tend to have

345
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,160
lower ganic matter contents and other

346
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,778
soils that have been deforested very

347
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,389
recently say in the last five or ten

348
00:16:54,778 --> 00:17:00,509
years that still have a lot of organic

349
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:03,480
matter and what they found was that when

350
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,308
they applied fertilizer that the

351
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,410
response to fertilizer was much more

352
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:09,720
favorable for the soils that had a

353
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,308
higher organic matter content than the

354
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,610
searles that had a very low organic

355
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:17,058
matter content and the this line here is

356
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:20,188
actually the the price of the fertilizer

357
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:23,039
which is 200 kenyan shillings in this

358
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:25,050
case per kilogram and so the soils that

359
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,509
were very degraded and very low in

360
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:32,009
organic matter didn't actually even have

361
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:34,440
a provide a profit to the nitrogen

362
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,629
application the reason being that these

363
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,669
soils had a lot of other constraints

364
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,370
because they were low in organic matter

365
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:44,040
so they may have had higher runoff they

366
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:46,259
maybe have had compaction problems they

367
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,509
may have been moored rowdy and so you

368
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:51,210
didn't actually get a good return on

369
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:54,119
your investment while on these better

370
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,130
soils you did get a much higher return

371
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,289
on your investments so we can think

372
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,669
similarly for other crops that if we

373
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,778
have

374
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:05,359
low quality soil or unhealthy soil that

375
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:08,628
we're not going to get as much return on

376
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:11,749
our investments than if we have a high

377
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:14,089
quality soil because there are so many

378
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:18,350
other constraints to deal with when we

379
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:21,189
have low quality soil so here are a few

380
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:24,709
other examples of ecological management

381
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,869
your many composts but not all they

382
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,379
suppress root diseases when used in a

383
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:32,689
potting mix but they also help fight

384
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:34,519
fight off lease leaf diseases so compost

385
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,710
for example can be actually quite

386
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,778
suppressive of all kinds of disease

387
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,129
problems because with the compost

388
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:43,579
there's a lot of beneficial organisms

389
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:46,548
that that help suppress the pathogenic

390
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,798
organisms another example lower

391
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:50,960
early-season nitrate levels decreased

392
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,418
viability and competitiveness of wheats

393
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,970
with small seeds because these run out

394
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:57,769
of nutrients more quickly so systems

395
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,700
that are very high in nitrate levels

396
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:03,159
actually may enhance competition of

397
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,840
undesirable species in this case seeds

398
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,269
another example flea beetle pressure and

399
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,158
damage to cabbage is more severe on

400
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:13,368
compacted soil this is some work from

401
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:17,080
Dave wolf here at Cornell that found

402
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:19,999
that when we have a role in poor health

403
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:23,538
that the insect pressure tends to be

404
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:25,548
much higher because the the the plant

405
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:28,999
isn't it can't resist these kind of

406
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:30,858
pressures as well another example root

407
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,720
rot severity of vegetable crops is

408
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:34,489
decreased by growing cover crops in

409
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,069
allowing sufficient time for them to

410
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:39,619
decompose sometimes we refer to the term

411
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:41,509
by a fumigation this is work by Georgia

412
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:45,288
Bobby in the plant pathology department

413
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:48,259
at Geneva and many cover crop suppress

414
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:50,888
plant parasitic nematodes also work from

415
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:54,409
Georgia Bobby's lab so there's a lot of

416
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:57,288
ecological principles and mutualism that

417
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:59,359
we can take advantage of when we use

418
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:02,450
these more agro-ecological approaches

419
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:04,398
and that reduces the need for these more

420
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,730
reactive approaches which typically

421
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:10,589
means expensive inputs like pesticides

422
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,000
and fertilizers

423
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,980
so this brings us back to the soil

424
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,619
health test that the optional BEC

425
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,110
discussed in the past few months because

426
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:23,548
the soil health test is really about

427
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:27,240
this more proactive long-term management

428
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:29,900
approach it's not about a quick test

429
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,990
that allows you to respond immediately

430
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,419
as you may remember we have physical

431
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,240
biological and chemical indicators that

432
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:43,288
we use in a test we measure their values

433
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:46,140
and we interpret those values into a

434
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:48,148
rating so we have a way of saying well

435
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,970
if the aggregate stability is twenty-six

436
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:54,778
percent is that good or is that bad and

437
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:59,579
we use the rating scale on a scale from

438
00:20:54,778 --> 00:21:02,009
0 to 100 so the end of the main idea

439
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,019
here is then to be able to identify the

440
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:07,319
constraints which are indicated in red

441
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:10,200
here and to be able to address these

442
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,109
constraints especially through more

443
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,090
long-term sustainable management

444
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:18,589
practices so the soil health test

445
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:22,859
basically is a guide to longer-term

446
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:26,819
sorel health management when we think

447
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:28,500
about Barry production we have 2s with

448
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,928
any other crop we have to think about

449
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,940
how do we actually interpret those

450
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,490
values so the aggregate stability is

451
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,298
twenty-six percent is that higher or is

452
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,730
that low and that also depends on what

453
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,980
kind of a crop that we're growing

454
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,620
similarly surface hardness or active

455
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,690
carbon so how do we actually interpret

456
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:53,250
these numbers and how do we do that for

457
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:55,409
very production in particular so we

458
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,720
develop these scoring curves that that

459
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,809
Bob discussed and we have basically

460
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,240
three categories one is where more is

461
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:05,509
better for example generally with

462
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,609
organic matter or active carbon or

463
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:10,980
aggregate stability the more the higher

464
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:14,609
the number the better it is in terms of

465
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,370
soil health in other cases we have less

466
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:19,529
it's better that an example of that

467
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:22,229
would for example be penetra meter

468
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:24,319
reading where a high number is actually

469
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:29,089
less favorable and then

470
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:32,450
have an optimum for example pH might be

471
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,069
an example of that I think what a key

472
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,288
point that we need to keep in mind is

473
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:39,019
that we've developed the sural health

474
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,419
test primarily for disturbed systems for

475
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:44,470
vegetables for field crops and that

476
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:48,049
these interpretations the scoring curves

477
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:50,210
would actually vary depending on what

478
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:51,798
kind of a system we have when we're

479
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,558
dealing with very systems they tend to

480
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,839
be less disturbed and we might have

481
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,690
different expectations another example

482
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:02,720
is that that some some berry crops

483
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,570
actually do better under a lower pH and

484
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,490
others under a higher pH and certainly

485
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:11,028
that might be different than something

486
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,710
for a typical vegetable or field crop so

487
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:17,089
one of the things we need to think about

488
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:19,819
is how can we how can we enhance and and

489
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:23,028
and adapt these scoring functions and

490
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:25,028
these interpretations to an a very

491
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:28,548
production system so that we can give

492
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:30,440
better management recommendations so the

493
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:33,558
way we had approached that with our

494
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,250
initial soil health test development was

495
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:39,908
to either use a frequency distribution

496
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,829
from our database what we did is we

497
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:45,950
analyze a lot of samples from basically

498
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:47,628
very low quality soil and very high

499
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,330
quality soil and everything in between

500
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:52,219
and then basically look at the

501
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:56,089
distribution and then develop a scoring

502
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:59,360
function from that we also use expert

503
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:01,970
opinion literature values for example

504
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,878
you know we do know what an optimum pH

505
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,960
is for many very crops or ver many

506
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:12,138
vegetables so we can apply that directly

507
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,819
to our interpretation system so again we

508
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:15,648
developed the soil health test primarily

509
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,960
for disturbed systems vegetables and

510
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:21,109
field crops and they would need to be

511
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,840
adapted to perennial systems we may need

512
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:25,939
to tweak those interpretation curves we

513
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,648
don't need to necessarily change the

514
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:32,570
measurement methodology we need to

515
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:34,668
change how we interpret the numbers so

516
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:37,609
this is just illustrates how we did that

517
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:40,190
this approach of looking at the

518
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:44,859
distribution function so if you measure

519
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:48,110
a lot of these a lot of soils from

520
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:51,349
variable conditions and you have some

521
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:54,229
information on how the crops perform on

522
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:55,609
the soils then you can develop this

523
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,210
distribution function and you can

524
00:24:55,609 --> 00:25:02,329
interpret how you know what's basically

525
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:04,910
high and what's low and so this for

526
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:07,339
example is for active carbon so if

527
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,669
you're less than 400 you're basically

528
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:14,750
pretty low and if you're greater than

529
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:17,799
800 you're pretty high so that's how you

530
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,390
might want to interpret those numbers

531
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:23,900
and what we did is we done basically

532
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,970
develop these scoring curves by taking

533
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,160
the normal distribution function and

534
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,259
turning that into a cumulative

535
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,390
distribution function which is just a

536
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:35,298
simple mathematical trick that you can

537
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,679
do in Excel and then you develop a

538
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:39,349
scoring function that helps you

539
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,890
interpret your measured value here on

540
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:47,389
the x-axis and putting that into a score

541
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:49,759
and with the low scores being in the red

542
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,070
zone and the high scores being in the

543
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,349
Green Zone and the intermediate ones

544
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:57,079
being in the yellow zone so what would

545
00:25:54,349 --> 00:26:00,649
need to need to happen if we want to

546
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,509
apply this framework to bury crops is we

547
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,660
need to tweak some of the scoring curves

548
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:08,298
to make them more applicable to vary

549
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,779
crops in general and perhaps to specific

550
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:14,119
crops like for example ph adjustments

551
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:16,009
that may be needed depending on what

552
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:22,159
particular berry crops we're talking

553
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:24,170
about so here's some

554
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,200
final thoughts then and this is my last

555
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,720
slide so proactive management helps

556
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,569
build resiliency into the cropping

557
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,789
system so this relates to some of the

558
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:39,049
very early webinars we did where we

559
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:43,869
talked about site selection site

560
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:47,869
remediation investing in in compaction

561
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:49,849
remediation adding organic matter doing

562
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:52,849
pH correction and all those kind of

563
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:56,149
things then secondly we may need to do

564
00:26:52,849 --> 00:27:00,230
some reactive management to optimize the

565
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:03,050
performance so this may involve you know

566
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,299
fertilizer application or sometimes pest

567
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,639
control might be needed so both

568
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:10,970
proactive and reactive management are

569
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,670
are critical my main point is that we've

570
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,370
tended to not put as much emphasis on

571
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:19,550
the proactive management and more on the

572
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:21,439
reactive management soil testing is an

573
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:24,740
important component and interpretations

574
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,690
need to be refined for very production

575
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,509
and I would say it's Earl testing both

576
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,670
the more conventional Cyril testing

577
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:35,210
which is really nutrient testing as well

578
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:37,269
as the more comprehensive testing as we

579
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,400
do in the Cornell's or a health test and

580
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:43,250
of course organic matter is a key

581
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,670
component this is the life in the soil

582
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,250
and it supports a lot of the organisms

583
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:52,850
in the soil and that's what allows for

584
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,140
this more agro ecological approach but

585
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:55,909
we should keep in mind that organic

586
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,190
matter is not not everything we can't

587
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:02,330
solve all the problems with organic

588
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:04,160
matter and that was my last slide so at

589
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:08,000
this point in time I will turn it back

590
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,240
to our moderator Laura thank you very

591
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,549
much I'm wondering if people have

592
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,430
questions right now if there's anything

593
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:18,399
on your mind I actually do have a

594
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:24,820
question maybe they start us off with

595
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:27,650
those scoring functions what volume of

596
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:31,460
testing what volume of tests do you need

597
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:34,259
to be able to kind of have some level of

598
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,110
confidence and be able to

599
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:40,619
make those those scoring functions work

600
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:43,019
for a perennial crop like berries are we

601
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:46,769
close to that do we need just a bigger

602
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:49,109
volume to analyze or how do you get

603
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:51,539
there from maybe where we are which is

604
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:57,539
that we need more interpretations or

605
00:28:51,539 --> 00:29:02,129
more information yeah that's said that

606
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:04,170
that's a good question Laura we you know

607
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,710
we don't have to reinvent a wheel for

608
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:12,120
this what is important is that we have a

609
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:16,079
better understanding of you know what

610
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:19,289
are more or less appropriate or let's

611
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:23,039
say good levels for some indicators and

612
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:25,170
and not-so-good levels we did some work

613
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,170
in the past years with the with the

614
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:31,320
grape group here at Cornell Tim

615
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:35,750
Mortensen and wailing Chang and Alan

616
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:39,689
laakso to to apply this or a health test

617
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:42,809
222 viticulture and of course the the

618
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,490
needs are slightly different in fact

619
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:46,470
when in viticulture it's a little bit

620
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,009
more complex because often you want the

621
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:52,380
crop to be somewhat stressed now for

622
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:56,490
most other Barry crops I don't think

623
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:59,490
that's that's the case so I I think that

624
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,170
the first step is to basically to to

625
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,569
look at the current scoring functions

626
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:07,259
and to see what might be appropriate for

627
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:10,519
example a very obvious change would be

628
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:13,559
you know what's an optimum pH level for

629
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,410
for a particular very crop and that of

630
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,440
course would vary depending on whether

631
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,480
it's blueberries or raspberries or and

632
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm I admit to not being an expert in

633
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,230
this area but I know that that much the

634
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,019
other thing is that you know because

635
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,539
these are more perennial systems that we

636
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:34,220
may be looking for different values of

637
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:37,680
say active carbon or organic matter and

638
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,630
so the the best approach I think and you

639
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,279
know in fact that's what what we're

640
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,820
planning to do as part of this grant is

641
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:49,359
to start collecting some samples from

642
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:51,039
from berry fields that you know that

643
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,629
hopefully represent a range of

644
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,480
conditions so we need to make sure that

645
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,030
we get samples from some source that we

646
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,190
really know are not performing very well

647
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:02,529
and we need to have some samples from

648
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,840
soils that we know do perform very well

649
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:08,440
and so then at least we can start

650
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:12,339
refining the range and and the boundary

651
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,440
conditions for good versus bad soil and

652
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:16,659
then it's it's a matter of sitting down

653
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,059
with some experts and then you know

654
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:22,330
coming up with with good numbers you

655
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:23,529
need to keep in mind that that that the

656
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:26,589
numbers that you get out of a soil

657
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:29,319
health tests are a management guide it

658
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:31,959
provides you insights like your blood

659
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:36,759
pressure or your cholesterol level for

660
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,009
for your human health but you know the

661
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,349
the egg that you can't do an exact

662
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:43,450
interpretation but you can learn a lot

663
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:46,779
from looking at these sort of Health

664
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:51,250
reports that allows you to better manage

665
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:56,160
your soil in your crops okay thank you

666
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:59,079
um Glenn Taylor from Maine asks is a

667
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,269
soil health test our soil health tests

668
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:05,769
ready for use in 2012 or still in

669
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:07,839
development they they are ready in fact

670
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:12,910
you could submit a sample tomorrow if

671
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:14,919
you wanted to they are now we we don't

672
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:18,009
have particular interpretations for

673
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:22,180
Barry crops but we are receiving samples

674
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:23,920
and we are providing results that that's

675
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,500
that a professional could certainly

676
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,180
interpret you know part of what we're

677
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,970
trying to do as part you know with this

678
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,590
grant is to is to help develop better

679
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:36,549
interpretations for Barry crops

680
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:38,829
specifically and then Oneida County is

681
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:40,779
wondering what we know about water

682
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:46,689
management and its effect on very

683
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:49,420
production if but I'm not sure whether I

684
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,490
quite understand the question but I mean

685
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,519
what we do know is that you know that

686
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:57,890
both extremes are our problems so we can

687
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,960
have too much water and

688
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,750
then we need to consider drainage

689
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,440
because you know excess water creates a

690
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,900
lot of problems denitrification more you

691
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,529
know pathogenic problems root rot etc

692
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:16,100
and we can also be on the other end

693
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:18,529
where we where there may be drought

694
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:21,109
stress now irrigation is certainly a

695
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,750
more or more reactive approach but we

696
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:27,199
can build a lot of internal strength in

697
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:30,019
the system by you know creating a soil

698
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,180
environment that is higher in organic

699
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:35,059
matter content because organic matter

700
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:39,140
holds a lot of moisture that allows for

701
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:42,679
deep rooting so no compacted zones that

702
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:46,030
that has a correct pH throughout the

703
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:51,740
profile because roots don't do well in

704
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:53,299
in acid subsoils so so we can build a

705
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,460
lot of strength in the system by

706
00:33:53,299 --> 00:34:02,450
basically creating a very strong and

707
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:04,970
extensive routing system yes and I just

708
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:08,480
want to add to oneida county last week's

709
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,940
of dr. Polanski Santos did talk a little

710
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,090
bit about fertility management and water

711
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,639
management in terms of for more soilless

712
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,220
very production so maybe that would be

713
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,980
of interest to you and Kathy mentioned

714
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:26,989
in the chat that that webinar plus some

715
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,599
material associated with it she is going

716
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:32,479
to be posting on the website and sending

717
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,199
a link to those of you who are on our

718
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,480
email list which i think is everybody

719
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,969
there Kathy also sent out an email to

720
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,210
folks wondering if they had any kind of

721
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:47,449
unresolved questions from the very

722
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,730
series and now might be a time if

723
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:51,739
anybody does have those or Kathy i don't

724
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:58,579
know if anybody emailed you back with

725
00:34:51,739 --> 00:35:00,469
anything about that Laura I didn't I

726
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,630
didn't get anybody with any burning

727
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:05,299
unresolved questions but if anyone he

728
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,720
has any it would be great to bring those

729
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,720
out now

730
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,140
okay Wow oh maybe Lee has something

731
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:23,108
there's no pressure Lee we're just all

732
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:23,108
watching to see how quickly you tight

733
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,260
neck is supposed to allow us to have to

734
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:43,239
be able to turn on each of your if you

735
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,030
had a headset we could independently

736
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:49,719
allow you an opportunity to speak we

737
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:52,870
have not tried that yet but maybe in

738
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,969
some other setting you will try that

739
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:58,059
because this is the problem this is the

740
00:35:54,969 --> 00:36:01,019
challenge is the typing part but thanks

741
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,019
for your patience everybody

742
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,340
the least comment is about submitting

743
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:19,740
multiple samples two from each of two

744
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:22,390
growers the results very interesting and

745
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:24,699
yeah i agree Lee I think this is

746
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:27,069
fascinating stuff we've just begun

747
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:29,739
working on it with vegetable growers and

748
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:34,809
I did do a couple with some very growers

749
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:37,419
in a reduced till study and and it is

750
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:39,759
not you know we think we know what's

751
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,460
going on in the soil but it is really

752
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,320
surprising when soil health tests come

753
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,659
back and proves that we don't know

754
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,740
everything about it just from you know

755
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:53,019
what we expect but yeah that's great and

756
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:54,969
Oneida County mentions the handouts and

757
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:57,460
website information will be helpful and

758
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:59,709
that is true and I'm going to take it

759
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,740
that people are done with questions so

760
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,440
why don't we move into the very last

761
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:08,349
portion portion thank you very much dr.

762
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,320
Van Ness Kathy heidenreich is now going

763
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:15,670
to give us a little summary and lay out

764
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:20,590
the next phase of the project so thanks

765
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:22,119
a lot Kathy thanks Laura and I'll ask

766
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,650
everyone to excuse me I'm just

767
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,969
recovering from a cold so I sound a

768
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:31,480
little bit like Dom duck today so what I

769
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:33,669
want to do just briefly is to review the

770
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,199
purpose of the project with you and give

771
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,940
you an idea where we are in the timeline

772
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:41,169
and where we'd like to go from here and

773
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:43,780
how you might play a role in that so the

774
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,269
issue that has been that commercial

775
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,260
berry growers in the Northeast

776
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:49,809
traditionally make standard fertilizer

777
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:52,540
applications based on crop age and as

778
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,909
dr. Vanessa pointed out so aptly today

779
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:59,469
it's it's a reactive sort of management

780
00:37:54,909 --> 00:38:02,109
versus proactive and this is in spite of

781
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:04,299
the fact that for ten years or more we

782
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,519
have some very good research that

783
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,460
indicates that analysis based

784
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,860
fertilization programs really are more

785
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,630
beneficial most in terms of dollars and

786
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,809
cents and in terms of yield and plant

787
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:20,260
health and that soil health can also

788
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:22,570
have an impact and soil health

789
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,910
improvement techniques have also not

790
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,039
been adapted

791
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:30,389
vary widely among berry growers and so

792
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:33,180
we have a concern about that so when we

793
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:36,150
started looking into why this might be

794
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:37,788
so we discovered that educators the

795
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,280
folks who have been participating in

796
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:44,400
particular are often called on to cover

797
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,200
multiple commodities and sometimes

798
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,298
they're actually operating outside their

799
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,659
field of expertise and so it's a

800
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:54,059
struggle to help Barry growers with soil

801
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:56,489
and nutrient management problems and

802
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,789
then also with interpretation of things

803
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:01,709
like there's the Cornell soil health

804
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:03,710
test results or the foliar analysis

805
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,088
results and that we didn't have any

806
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:10,949
comprehensive resources on this to help

807
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:12,779
people do that so dr. Marvin pritts and

808
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:15,389
the the team have put together a

809
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,940
two-year project to help provide some

810
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:22,318
training both for educators and for the

811
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:24,210
berry growers and so this webinar series

812
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:26,909
has actually been here one of the plan

813
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,389
we can check that off now we've worked

814
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:31,379
through the 12 webinars together and

815
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:33,269
while you've been working through the

816
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,670
webinars we've been working on resources

817
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:39,239
that you will be able to use in grower

818
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:41,789
training and so the next phase is where

819
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:45,479
we're hoping that it's your turn and

820
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:47,819
that you'll assist us by providing some

821
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,139
training to growers and so we're going

822
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:53,009
to look at that in a little more detail

823
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,940
so how we're going to measure the

824
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:58,349
success we're going to look at knowledge

825
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,568
before and after participating in the

826
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:02,548
project to see what sort of changes may

827
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:05,009
have occurred and then we're also going

828
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:08,519
to look at adoption and success of

829
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:11,549
analysis based nutrient and soil

830
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:17,579
management in years to follow after the

831
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:19,380
project so we had 72 educators when we

832
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,630
started we've had various numbers of

833
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,910
educators throughout and so we've

834
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:27,000
accomplished the first goal and the

835
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:30,509
second goal we'd like to have 15 of you

836
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,088
who've been willing to train to actually

837
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,319
develop and delivers an outreach program

838
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:37,400
and we're hoping that we'll get at least

839
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:39,500
10 growers at each or more

840
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,900
at each training and then that 50 of

841
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,880
them will participate in a soil and

842
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:48,860
nutrient management health testing and

843
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,380
so we have complementary Cornell soil

844
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,019
health tests for 50 growers we also have

845
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:56,769
complementary foliar analysis test for

846
00:40:54,019 --> 00:41:00,199
the same 50 and then we're hoping that

847
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:02,300
educators who sponsor training will work

848
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:04,279
one on one with the growers to interpret

849
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:08,630
the results and to come up with some

850
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:11,780
sort of a plan to implement on farm and

851
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,849
then that the same educators will

852
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,840
collect feedback from the growers on how

853
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:21,559
well they think it worked so let's talk

854
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,440
about where we're going from here so in

855
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,969
terms of the webinar I do have a list of

856
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,260
people we were missing demographics

857
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,119
questionnaires from and I'll be mailing

858
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,030
emailing them and letting them know and

859
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,269
there's a post-test remember in the on

860
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,130
the first webinar we went through 20

861
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:40,880
questions to test your knowledge to see

862
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:46,250
where you were starting from there is a

863
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:48,619
survey monkey survey and if you look in

864
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,840
the bottom left-hand box the web's links

865
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,400
box you'll see the post-test there and

866
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,620
you're able to take that that will be

867
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,660
open for a month in case you haven't had

868
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:59,569
a chance to finish all the webinars or

869
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:01,609
you need to go back and listen to the

870
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,500
recording of that one you missed and

871
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,450
then there's also an evaluation so we're

872
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,699
asking that each person who participated

873
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:09,739
whether you only saw one webinar whether

874
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:12,799
you went through all 12 would do both

875
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:14,359
the post-test and the evaluation and

876
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,250
I'll be sending out an email reminder on

877
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:22,070
that as well so now it's your turn so

878
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,710
what we're hoping to have well we will

879
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,990
have is materials available for you to

880
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:29,030
assit to assist you with grower training

881
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,109
we have some web pages that are under

882
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,510
development that are nearing completion

883
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:35,120
you'll be able to have those available

884
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:39,050
as well and to provide input as to their

885
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,519
utility and how what may be missing or

886
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,250
what would be useful that may not be

887
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,289
offered their the members of the team

888
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,320
will be available to assist on request

889
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:51,300
and i'm going to be posting training

890
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:54,450
dates on the ark webinar archive

891
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,539
page so that we can try to avoid

892
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:59,069
overlaps and training because I'm

893
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:02,070
convinced of course that everyone want

894
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,900
to go out and do this so what we'll have

895
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,180
in terms of grower training materials is

896
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,570
a one-hour PowerPoint presentation

897
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:12,989
that's going to discuss Cornell soil

898
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:15,269
health test and the assessment and then

899
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:17,519
foliar analysis and it can be used in a

900
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:19,139
classroom or field setting will have a

901
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,940
set of grower pre and post test

902
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:23,730
questions to go with that maybe a short

903
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,860
set five or ten questions so that we can

904
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,619
measure knowledge before and knowledge

905
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,440
knowledge after will have some sample

906
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:34,109
test results for group exercises

907
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,630
remember when Marvin and Eric talked

908
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:38,070
about the test results and what sort of

909
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:43,400
mediation would be needed and also

910
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:46,590
Robert with a soil health test and then

911
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,570
apart from that in terms of your grower

912
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:52,350
training you're able to add whatever

913
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,610
bits and pieces you might like from you

914
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:55,170
know playing the recorded webinars

915
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,230
having guest speakers covering other

916
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:02,309
topics really you can cater it to the

917
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,809
needs of your growers so once your

918
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:06,150
training is complete we're going to ask

919
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:08,340
you to select some participating growers

920
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,010
to participate in the soil health test

921
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,230
and the foliar analysis and then at

922
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,550
we're going to have a standard operating

923
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,210
procedure that will make available to

924
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:20,730
you and them which will discuss how they

925
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:23,010
might implement at least one or two of

926
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:26,340
the practices on their farm on a portion

927
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,780
of their crop and then we would also ask

928
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,150
them to participate in an exit interview

929
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:36,060
to share their insights on the crop

930
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:37,650
health and performance of the new

931
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:42,869
practices that they've implemented

932
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:44,610
versus their standard practice and so

933
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:46,109
you'll be hearing for me in the next

934
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,480
couple of weeks we hope many of you will

935
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,950
be interested in participating and we

936
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:56,250
want to thank you very much for being a

937
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:58,859
part of the webinar series all right

938
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,019
Thank You Kathy there is a couple of

939
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,789
questions or at least Lee has a question

940
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:07,110
about funding to support the outreach

941
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:12,150
program i'm lee we didn't we didn't have

942
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:13,890
that in the budget for the project we

943
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,519
specifically were interested in building

944
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:19,049
the numbers of soil health tests we had

945
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,039
to go into the database so that we could

946
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,430
start working on those recommendations

947
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:26,059
so we we focused the the funds in that

948
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,059
in that area

949
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:33,530
okay and we can put your email we can

950
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,909
put the email right here in the chat box

951
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:40,040
if you'd like mark and so so the links

952
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:42,349
are there for the educator post-test if

953
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:43,610
you're ready to take that now certainly

954
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:47,059
you could do the webinar series

955
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:49,309
evaluation probably because you don't

956
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:52,340
need to listen to all of them in order

957
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:54,889
to complete that but we do hope to hear

958
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,870
from all of you I think this is a rather

959
00:45:54,889 --> 00:46:00,049
exciting way to get training out to a

960
00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:02,269
large amount of people so I hope

961
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,050
everyone is able to take advantage of it

962
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:07,880
and if you have any other questions

963
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:11,840
please okay so there are a couple more

964
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:16,970
questions the outreach program targeted

965
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:21,230
only to Northeast states Bob wonders I'm

966
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:25,039
Bob that's a good question and it's not

967
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:27,889
necessarily only Northeast states that's

968
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,269
the primary focus of Northeast air but

969
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:31,789
we really are interested in getting 50

970
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:34,250
growers lined up and so once I have an

971
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,809
idea of once people have let me know

972
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,250
who's interested in having a training

973
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:38,329
i'll have a better handle on that and

974
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:42,530
i'll be able to talk to you about that

975
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:45,650
specifically and initially what we

976
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:48,320
decided to do would be we have 50

977
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,789
complimentary sets of tests depending on

978
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,080
how many grower trainings that we have

979
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:54,320
we're thinking about dividing them

980
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,420
amongst the number of trainings and so

981
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,590
Sharon in terms of first come first

982
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:02,780
serve basis no not necessarily educators

983
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,430
who are hosting training say we have 10

984
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,010
educators who host training we have 50

985
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:10,849
tests then we would have five tests

986
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:14,960
available for each training if we have

987
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:17,119
four people you know we could have 12

988
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,720
and a half for each training so you kind

989
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,130
of get the idea so so far we have four

990
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:25,159
scheduled and they're listed in the box

991
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,900
on the right and we're hoping to in the

992
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:28,250
next couple of weeks to get the other

993
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,900
scheduled and then we'll know how many

994
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:35,599

997
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:43,069

may 9th in water port New York and made

1000
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,070
tenth and Williamson New York so there

1001
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:54,139
are some opportunities and we will have

1002
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,420

1003
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:59,869
exact contact information and stuff in

1004
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:03,019
case someone would like to go and watch

1005
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:05,269
how it's done or just want to advertise

1006
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:08,809
it to your growers but we do hope that

1007
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:11,480
you will go ahead and most of your very

1008
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:12,949
experienced growers or educator so this

1009
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,500
should not be a problem especially when

1010
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:18,859
you have all of the equipment to do the

1011
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:21,920
training with do we have any other

1012
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:24,680
questions either about content for about

1013
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:30,860
the administrative kind of approach of

1014
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:34,759
the grant so if not I'm going to leave
