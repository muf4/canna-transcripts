1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:12,320
University I'm going to talk a little

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,719
fast because there's a lot of stuff I

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,039
want to go over I'm from the state of

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:17,640
Minnesota crazy place the only place to

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,720
elect a professional

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,600
wrestler as Governor as governor and not

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,518
many places do that some things about

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,760
Minnesota second largest variation in

10
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:27,839
temperature in the continental US 38c

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,800
to-

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,799
53c 90,000 Mi of Shoreline more than

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,520
California Florida Hawaii and combined

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,159
we measure every

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,559
puddle the largest population of people

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,640
of Scandinavian Somalian M descent

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,159
outside of those countries so we are

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,439
somewhat diverse I'm at the great

19
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,799
University of Minnesota 55,000

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,558
undergraduates it's big School home of

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,479
Norman borlo won the Nobel Peace Prize

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,439
honey crisp apples from Jim Luby in my

23
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:00,518
department something happened

24
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,558
oh and where they discovered the

25
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,920
pacemaker which is that strange machine

26
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,118
down on the bottom metronics spun off of

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,359
um largest city is the City of

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,680
Minneapolis Minnesota a couple million

29
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,959
people and Minneapolis has a Park Board

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,680
I'm chair of the park board the park

31
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,759
board existed before the City of

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,118
Minneapolis and so I help run um a park

33
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:25,719
system with 183 parks and 50 recreation

34
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:28,840
centers 1,00 kid sports teams I have my

35
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,478
own police force which is

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,640
something

37
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,000
6,732 acres of land and natural area

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
that we manage and then there's a bunch

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,239
of other statistics I'm not going to

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,478
talk about that now but I do know there

41
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,920
are some people who are interested in

42
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,478
urban agriculture I'm instead going to

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,519
talk about plants and stresses in

44
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,799
Plants now some changes that have

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,438
happened since the 60s why did it even

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,240
get into this area the crops we grow in

47
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,199
the 60s which is the last time a lot of

48
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,280
work in uh CO2 photosynthesis and some

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,039
of that work in floriculture was done

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,519
has changed the industry was cut flowers

51
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,280
and potted plants now the industry is

52
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,959
based on bedding plants and the number

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,479
of species we grow is increased

54
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,000
dramatically energy costs have increased

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,000
and profit margins have decreased

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,400
dramatically in the industry we now have

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,239
HPS and LED lighting which was not as

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,840
common place back then and we have shade

59
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,759
curtains and environmental control

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,878
computers but we don't have information

61
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,120
to put in them and temperature and CO2

62
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,199
levels have increased when I was in

63
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,280
graduate school with Marvin the standard

64
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:34,280
was 333 parts per million right now it's

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,239
388

66
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,120
so there is little to no information on

67
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,200
lighting temperature and CO2 standards

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,080
for the current crops we grow even the

69
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
geraniums we grow now are different than

70
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,080
the geraniums that were grown in the 60s

71
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,158
and 70s and we don't have any

72
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,560
information to utilize this fantastic

73
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:54,079
equipment that we have that run our

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,319
green houses I also want to talk about a

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
little bit how we stress our plants out

76
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,759
on a regular basis and often don't

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,959
appreciate it we have cool season CR

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,639
crops and War SE warm season crops and

79
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,759
this is a relative growth rate curve of

80
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,439
two kinds of turf but notice with cool

81
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,959
season crops and I'll show you data to

82
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,000
this effect 20° there's a maximum C and

83
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,479
notice above 20° you actually start

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,360
having a decline and I'll start showing

85
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,679
that with photosynthesis and development

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,879
rate on some common crops we grow I

87
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,599
think we stress our plants out commonly

88
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,359
and have no appreciation that we are in

89
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,518
fact doing that and I'll show some

90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,319
evidence of that I'm going to talk about

91
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,480
abiotic stresses is Neil mentioned I'm

92
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,679
going to talk about light temperature

93
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,840
and CO2 I'm going to talk a little bit

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,480
about biotic stresses and then I work in

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,560
a variety of other areas and I just want

96
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,318
to give you a little bit of an idea what

97
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,199
some of those are this is some data of

98
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,560
the average daily light integral of

99
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,119
moles of light per day in January

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,158
throughout the United States and you can

101
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,079
see that you as Minnesota is at 2 to

102
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:57,158
four and at most six moles of light and

103
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,799
that there are parts of the United

104
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,120
States that benefit greatly from adding

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,920
supplemental lighting and you can see

106
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,599
the Cornell is in there as well as

107
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,000
Minnesota why do we light well when we

108
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,839
do light there's some benefits here we

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,120
have a graph of Daily Light integral and

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,759
this is cutting yield per pot and this

111
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,399
is for taking uh cuting off of a pot

112
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,439
stock plants and we can see that as the

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,439
Daily Light integral goes up the cutting

114
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,000
yield goes up and we can also see with

115
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,719
two different levels of CO2 the yield

116
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,439
goes up but in generally yield of any

117
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,600
crop be it Tomatoes Greenhouse Peppers

118
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,199
lettuce dry weight is proportionally

119
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,840
increases with

120
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,879
photosynthesis this is actually a

121
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,439
picture from Neil I think isn't it Neil

122
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,680
you recognize that

123
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,918
picture Neil took this picture a long

124
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,319
time ago there's this is purple wave

125
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,879
petunia with night Interruption lighting

126
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,000
and this is supplemented with 150 micro

127
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,399
of uh additional High HPS light and this

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,160
is just to demonstrate both of these

129
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,959
have long days but which one flowers

130
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,880
quicker the one with the higher light

131
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,279
level or

132
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,719
par says standard photosyn synthesis

133
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,719
curve that's been used forever in the

134
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,600
day basically shows that as absorb light

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,080
or par goes up CO2 assimilation goes up

136
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,000
there's some region that's typically in

137
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,719
the winter in our area where plants are

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,639
light limited but once you get up to a

139
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,880
certain level which is typically around

140
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:22,600
4 to 600 micro saturation occurs and the

141
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:25,719
plant photosynthesis is CO2

142
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,080
limited so we started collecting data we

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,639
use a l core 6400 we did 25 different

144
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,198
species so we have huge data sets I'm

145
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,600
just going to show you some brief ones

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
to make some points this is impatience

147
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,360
you can see the

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,960
impatience

149
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,439
um par go as par goes up PN goes up

150
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:48,239
until you reach approximately 400 micro

151
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,879
of light okay a single no you'll see

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,918
some standard deviations so what we do

153
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,918
is we take five different plants so each

154
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,918
each one is it's five separate curves

155
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,000
from five separate leaves and then

156
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:02,758
that's replicated again three times over

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,918
time horizontal leaves

158
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,479
or one horizontal Leaf so we use a l cor

159
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,318
6400 which clamps right on yep and I'll

160
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,560
come back to some something related to

161
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
that question a little bit this is um

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
from a tomato grower this is bushel Boy

163
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
tomatoes um they each of these

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,918
represents a different cultivar I just

165
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,279
want to show that within a species even

166
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,318
within a single Greenhouse you can have

167
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,918
very different rates of photosynthesis

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,039
and you can have saturation occurring at

169
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,399
different spots this is 750 micro so

170
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,478
it's higher than the impatients and

171
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,120
notice that this particular cultivar was

172
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,478
still increasing so there's dramatically

173
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,199
different responses to increasing light

174
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,159
suggesting that even within the same

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,800
Greenhouse there should be different

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,520
light management strategies based on the

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,598
cultivar that's

178
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:53,560
used in addition we looked at some Leaf

179
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,399
filtering and this has not been

180
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,959
considered really but here's coas and

181
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,519
here's panicum a grass and a coas and

182
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,560
then we just measured light intensity As

183
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,598
you move down through the canopy showing

184
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,120
that you have significant filtering now

185
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,159
these plants were just barely touching

186
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,360
okay but this just goes to show you that

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
only 60% of the incident light in a

188
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,919
colia canopy actually gets to the middle

189
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,000
of the plant and by the time you get to

190
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,318
the bottom of the plant you're down to

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,240
18% of of Radiance that actually can

192
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,039
penetrate in contrast of course with the

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,038
grass it's better 80% and

194
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,079
55% and then we shade we have these

195
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,639
shade curtain systems you have them in

196
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,079
your Greenhouse but how do we decide

197
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,120
when to close the

198
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,359
shade who decides Bill who

199
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,959
decides you divine

200
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,479
it we Divine it there's no

201
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,560
information with which to use to

202
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,918
identify when we do this now I'll tell

203
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,000
you that most green houses use a

204
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,279
standard of 3 to 4,000 foot candles

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,319
which is comparable to around 600 to 800

206
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,918
micro and then the shade system starts

207
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,720
closing

208
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,158
also in our systems that we have if you

209
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,440
go out to your green houses the light

210
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:07,879
sensors that control the shade systems

211
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,959
where does where are they they're on a

212
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,960
weather station that's on outside of the

213
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,839
greenhouse

214
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,719
okay in general only 60% of incident

215
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,679
light enters the greenhouse you have

216
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,440
more than that because you have single

217
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,038
pane glass in a lot of your green houses

218
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,800
most places have exite or double poly or

219
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,878
another kind of poly that diffuses the

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
light so yours is actually better and

221
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,320
the shap cloth systems typically the the

222
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,639
standard shade cloth is 55% light

223
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,399
reduction curtain that comes

224
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,718
across therefore if it if you use a

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,799
typical shade system with 55% when it

226
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,399
closes at 600 micro of light okay

227
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,399
Radiance of the top of the canopy after

228
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,120
getting into the greenhouse and going

229
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,519
through a shade system is all the way

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,639
reduced to 198

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,480
micromols and that's at the top of the

232
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,838
plant and if you go to the middle of the

233
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,000
plant in a typical C canopy you're down

234
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,680
to all the way down to a third of the

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,519
actual light that comes in to look at an

236
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,439
impatience curve at 600 this is where

237
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,240
you're at getting into the greenhouse

238
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,600
and and the shade cloth system closed

239
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,919
and then this is halfway down on the

240
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,879
canopy down to

241
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,399
119 you've reduced your photosynthesis

242
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:27,679
in that particular instance from close

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:31,799
to 7 okay all the way down to just above

244
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:35,239
two a third of the photosynthesis you've

245
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,359
effectively starved your plant at that

246
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,440
point and green houses are routinely

247
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,919
doing this that they're over shading all

248
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,800
the time which is creating significant

249
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,199
problems that they're not aware of so

250
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:51,240
for instance in a ro cut rose Greenhouse

251
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,240
or a greenhouse veget tomato uh facility

252
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,560
they have more blind choots at in those

253
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,159
facilities with roses and they have less

254
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:03,679
fertile flowers with tomatoes and the

255
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,799
whole problem was because of the shade

256
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,679
system because they did weren't using

257
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,639
good numbers on the shade system the

258
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,000
solution first of all is quite simple

259
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,879
take the meter that runs the system take

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,679
it off the top of the pole outside of

261
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,240
the greenhouse and move it into the

262
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,439
greenhouse into the middle of the canopy

263
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,759
where the plants are

264
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,600
growing it's not too complicated okay

265
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,759
it's very simple and straightforward why

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
not simply set reset the figure reset

267
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,919
the Fig you can but the problem is this

268
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,879
that during you know we're in the North

269
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,599
and the sun comes up and up here it

270
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,399
comes up in Minneapolis it gets up 23

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
degrees above the Horizon on Christmas

272
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,919
and then goes back down again when the

273
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,120
light barely comes up like that more

274
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,799
skips off the glass and so still this so

275
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,799
in other words your what gets in the

276
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,078
greenhouse changes depending on the sun

277
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,719
angle so simply the best thing is just

278
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,759
put it in the greenhouse which none of

279
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,399
the greenhouse companies do and which

280
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,559
actually absolutely would be the best

281
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,600
thing for all of you to do and then run

282
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,879
the shade system off that that works for

283
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,079
any Greenhouse I don't know if a single

284
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,120
Greenhouse in the United States that has

285
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:15,319
the light sensor where the plants are

286
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,679
okay wishing topics the

287
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,000
temperature the world is a warm place

288
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,199
and it's getting warmer okay it's a

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,039
premise that that I work off of I work

290
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,399
in a lot of heat stress we are

291
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,078
routinely causing heat stress in our

292
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,078
crops and most of don't appreciate that

293
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,359
now plants naturally try to do things

294
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,399
they'll reflect light as best they can

295
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,879
in warm

296
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,200
places but we often will stress many of

297
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,399
our crops bushel Boy tomatoes which is a

298
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,680
large large Greenhouse tomato producer

299
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,600
their lowest yield is the summer which

300
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,199
is not what you would expect but that's

301
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
when yield is the lowest why is it the

302
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,320
lowest when we we started this research

303
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,360
project because of them it's simply

304
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,560
because of heat stress that occurs on

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
tomatoes okay species differ in the

306
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,838
optimal temperature for photosynthesis

307
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
and that optimal temperature can

308
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,480
actually change as a season

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,800
progresses okay it's my belief that

310
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,639
we're R routinely reducing

311
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,000
photosynthesis by growing plants too

312
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,799
warm I'll show you some

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,679
examples here's a curve this is um

314
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:24,278
pansy temperature C there's three light

315
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:27,359
levels 300 600 and 900 micromoles and

316
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,799
here's PN and you can see the pansy PN

317
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,600
is optimal at 20

318
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:35,319
C okay you can also see that as you go

319
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,159
above 20° C which the green houses

320
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,920
probably are even today that

321
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,879
photosynthesis starts to

322
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,240
decline and you can see this on the

323
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,198
plants here's two plants and sorry for

324
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,919
it's in Fahrenheit there's constant 20 C

325
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,159
on the left and you have 30 C on the

326
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,599
right you can pretty clearly see the 30

327
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,078
C pansy has less photosynthesis that's

328
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,240
it's occurred with that

329
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,039
crop there's a group of crops that I

330
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,680
would say are mid-range this is Gerra

331
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,919
and you can see it is an optimal

332
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,039
temperature between 20 and

333
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,278
25 and then you can see a shift so

334
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,838
further with po Zetta where you'll have

335
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,919
an optimal temperature with po Zetta

336
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,160
around 30° C and this is why we can

337
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,679
raise pointsetta stock plants in a

338
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,439
greenhouse during the

339
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,759
summer but a question we started asking

340
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,560
is why or what is the justification or

341
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,759
cause for these responses for these

342
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,838
curves to shift because the

343
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,600
photochemistry

344
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
should be essentially the

345
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,879
same we started looking at stomates and

346
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,198
just plain old stomal conductance and

347
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,480
stodal

348
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:42,198
behavior and if you remember the pansy

349
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,240
plot this is actually temperature versus

350
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,399
stodal

351
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,839
conductance you can see it's quite high

352
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,839
and as temperature increased the

353
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,519
stomates actually

354
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,120
closed the limitation that occurred with

355
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,600
photosynthesis may be associated with

356
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,320
closure of

357
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,519
stomates okay

358
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,399
okay if we look at

359
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,639
Gerra and look at the stomatal

360
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,919
conductance with Gerra we can see that

361
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,198
we also had here was around where we had

362
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,360
the optimal temperature and then you can

363
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,559
see the decline

364
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,199
again suggesting that frankly if the

365
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,359
stomates closes of course the plant is

366
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,319
going to have less

367
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,039
photosynthesis and that may be part of

368
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,000
the justification for

369
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,639
that something else we looked at is

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,480
shortterm high

371
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,759
temperature okay what we found was that

372
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,920
a short term and by what short term 2

373
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,759
hours okay now we focus on temperatures

374
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,679
that are not temperatures that people

375
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,079
would call heat shock there's lots of

376
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,198
research on heat shock and that

377
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:47,278
typically is at temperatures of 40 to 45

378
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,838
C we're looking at temperatures that are

379
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,320
30 to 40 that plants see on a very

380
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,759
common basis in a

381
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,680
greenhouse but we asked the question if

382
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,199
we let the temperatures heat up to 95

383
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,399
degrees fenhe for 2 hours

384
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,838
was there any impact on a plant and

385
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,720
there

386
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,360
was this is

387
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,839
a uh graph of par on the bottom versus

388
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,360
PN and you can see the a typical curve

389
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,320
right here but look at what happened if

390
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,120
the plants were exposed the 2 hours at

391
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,839
35c and we redid the curve we had a

392
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,360
fully a 59% reduction in the maximum

393
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,120
photosynthesis the plant could do we

394
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,000
went back in the next day and measured

395
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:35,480
again we were still depressed the next

396
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,360
day it came up it took 3 days 3 days for

397
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,399
the plant to recover from that single 95

398
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,240
degree

399
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,278
exposure we worked on some other crops

400
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,079
this is petunia this is glow lavender

401
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:51,000
Shades we saw the same response

402
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,479
significant depression and 3 days to

403
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,120
come back up so these short-term high

404
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,360
temperature exposures can have a long a

405
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,120
3-day or more effect Growers are in fact

406
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,440
doing this why because they want to save

407
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,959
money they let their Greenhouse

408
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,759
temperatures increase at the end of the

409
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,479
day to capture

410
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,000
heat and keep the greenhouse closed

411
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,399
hoping that they'll keep the heat moving

412
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,399
into the

413
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,879
night now the Israelis have did have

414
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,000
done some work with this actually as

415
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,000
well they did work with field

416
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,958
tomatoes and part of the they saw the

417
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,159
midday depression in photosynthesis that

418
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,679
often occurs and so what they did is

419
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,759
they irrigated the field tomatoes and

420
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,359
cooled the leaves when the leaves got

421
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,079
really hot at that one time of the day

422
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,199
and they've found the significant they

423
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,838
got a significant increase in yield as a

424
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,879
result of that and it eliminated the

425
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,279
midday depression of photosynthesis that

426
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,439
occurred from that high temperature I

427
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,078
wonder if we could apply some of these

428
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,519
Concepts in green houses as well or

429
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,439
Greenhouse tomato production essentially

430
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,159
anytime the temperature exceeds the

431
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,079
maximum you should do whatever you can

432
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:03,439
to try to reduce the

433
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,240
temperature um to the optimal

434
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,759
temperature range I'll mention one other

435
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,679
thing we called around then we started

436
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,679
looking for what are the fundamental

437
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
differences between heat tolerant plants

438
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,798
with respect to flowering and heat

439
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,519
intolerant so what we did is we called

440
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,959
companies that produce flowers beding

441
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,558
plants of different kinds send us a

442
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,600
geranium that's very heat tolerant and

443
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,959
send us a geranium that's very heat

444
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,159
intolerant and then we did

445
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,480
photosynthetic response curves and in

446
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
every case and these are across

447
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,319
companies and across species in every

448
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,919
case the heat tolerant plant which is in

449
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,678
red always had a higher photosynthetic

450
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,600
rate than the heat intolerant

451
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,559
plant suggesting that there may be some

452
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:50,199
association with heat tolerance as well

453
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,599
and it brings to mind we did some work

454
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,240
on some arabidopsis as

455
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,480
well everyone works on a rabbit opsis at

456
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,599
one point or another and what we did is

457
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,880
we looked at how different kinds of heat

458
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,279
stresses we did 1 Hour 2 Hour 4 Hour 8

459
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
Hour 16 hour how these different

460
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,678
stresses at different temperatures so we

461
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,720
imposed all different kinds of stress

462
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,559
because the the term stress is a

463
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,960
difficult term to Define because

464
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:20,119
because how do we Define it you know

465
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,960
what is it is it 8 hours at 28 degrees

466
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,119
or 1 hour at 36

467
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,880
degrees and what we found is a very

468
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,000
strange relationship and this is we

469
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,080
published this back in 2005 and we

470
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,480
looked at these are we evaluated a

471
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,879
number of different arabidopsis strains

472
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,038
but what we did is we put it onto a

473
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,679
degree day model and the data fit almost

474
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,119
too close it's one of these situations

475
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,400
where the graduate student comes back

476
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,839
and gives you something and you think

477
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,320
they had to have moved points but you

478
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,480
can see these points fit the models and

479
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,359
what this was was this is the data

480
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,798
suggested there was a cumulative effect

481
00:18:52,359 --> 00:19:00,079
of these different stresses okay with a

482
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:03,440
degree hour concept over 32°

483
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,079
okay and that for whatever reason when

484
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,200
we exceeded

485
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:11,759
225°

486
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,759
hours okay over 32° you could see that

487
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,480
we went from no abortion to completely

488
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:21,440
aborting all the flowers on a Rabbid

489
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,640
opsis we don't understand this but it

490
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,759
didn't matter how the stresses were

491
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,000
arranged in other words a 38° stress for

492
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:33,279
3 hours hours or

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,038
34° for more time it was the cumulative

494
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,038
effect in degre hours over 32

495
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,400
Dees so taken together if you look at

496
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:51,158
the stomatal conductance stuff we

497
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,400
have it brings to mind a couple

498
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,320
questions do some plants either produce

499
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,559
more ABA okay those plants that were

500
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,720
heat sensitive do they produce prod more

501
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,918
AB in response to a Chron chronic high

502
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,038
temperature

503
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,440
stress or are they more

504
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,440
responsive to the high temperature

505
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,440
stress to the same endogenous ABA level

506
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,679
because the responses we're seeing time

507
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,038
and time again are related to stomatal

508
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,559
closure not any damage to the photo

509
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,519
system in the temperature range I'm

510
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,480
talking

511
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,798
about okay okay can stomatal

512
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,319
conductance after a single stress be a

513
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,158
way that we can screen for heat

514
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:31,319
tolerance

515
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,159
because after heat stress even a 2-hour

516
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,678
heat stress if the St stomates are

517
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,240
staying open and the plant is still

518
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,960
actively photosynthesizing it likely is

519
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,480
going to be more heat tolerant than one

520
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,519
that is not so this is a screen protocol

521
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,519
that can be

522
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,519
used

523
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,280
CO2 we went back and started looking at

524
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,360
CO2 all the greenh houses in the United

525
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,079
States people who've been around for a

526
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,399
while remember there used to be CO2

527
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,038
burners in green houses we got away from

528
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
them because the burners would not work

529
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:03,798
properly and they'd release ethylene

530
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,880
you'd have disasters and so people got

531
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,480
away from using CO2 burners so if you go

532
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,720
around to green houses now in

533
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,759
floriculture there's next to no CO2

534
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,640
being used here's

535
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,038
cyclen down here is ambient all the way

536
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,320
down here look at the degree of

537
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,759
responsiveness that you can get on

538
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,359
cyclan by increasing

539
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,640
CO2 here's Greenhouse Tomatoes now this

540
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,000
particular grower is Greenhouse tomato

541
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,840
Growers and Greenhouse vegetable Growers

542
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,480
do inject CO2 typically up to 800 parts

543
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:37,918
per million so you can

544
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,440
see that's here and some of these

545
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,480
species still would benefit but the

546
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,480
bottom line is there was huge huge

547
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,120
responses to CO2 more than what we

548
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,679
appreciate we went into the research

549
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,519
green houses and looked at what are our

550
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,159
CO2 levels on a sunny day in January

551
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:00,079
it's the meter reading 193 parts per

552
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,278
million 193 parts per where did the CO2

553
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,720
go the plants used it up the new green

554
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,278
houses we have we've spent so much

555
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,120
effort and time making them

556
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:12,200
tight that the CO2 levels in the green

557
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,519
houses are actually significantly

558
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,679
depleted significantly depleted and we

559
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,639
don't even really appreciate this to

560
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,440
give you an

561
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,400
idea this is 1 hour under would be

562
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,240
considered low light medium light and

563
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,600
high light started at 388 1 hour in a

564
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,278
low light greenhouse the rate the CO2

565
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,759
level drop to 370 1 hour in medium light

566
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:40,240
down to 340 1 hour in high light all the

567
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:42,879
way down to 310 in one hour in a single

568
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,558
hour okay now I can tell you if you have

569
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,720
all kinds of high pressure sodium lights

570
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:51,639
up there after 2 3 hours your plants if

571
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,839
they're down to 190 parts per million

572
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,880
they're not using all that light You're

573
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,599
simply wasting the

574
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,840
light the new open roof green houses

575
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,678
that people recognize gives you Superior

576
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,839
growth in the industry part of the

577
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,519
reason I believe is frankly that these

578
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:11,519
have CO2 levels that are similar to

579
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:14,400
ambient CO2 and they're not CO2

580
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,440
depleted the addition of CO2 is the

581
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,960
number one most cost-effective way to

582
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,640
actually increase photosynthesis in a

583
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,400
greenhouse today not all the lighting

584
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,559
it's number one if I take a CO2 sensor

585
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,320
and go into a canopy on a bench on any

586
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,839
of your canopies okay it you'll check

587
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,200
and you'll find that your CO2 level

588
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,798
inside that canopy is often around two

589
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,960
to 300 parts per

590
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,798
million okay even when the greenhouse is

591
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,640
venting because you get this boundary

592
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:45,119
layer that's that forms on the bench

593
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,038
itself in some cases doing nothing more

594
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,839
than circulating your air at least

595
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,440
equalizes the CO2 level within the

596
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,879
greenhouse so you don't have depletion

597
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,880
within a canopy at least you'll get up

598
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,520
to 380 if you're bringing in air from

599
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,440
outside

600
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,000
and I think in our experimental green

601
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,480
houses and in our growth Chambers we are

602
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,919
commonly depleting or growing plants and

603
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,558
depleted CO2 levels that are actually

604
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,679
dramatically affecting our results and

605
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,200
in some cases invalidating them because

606
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,640
the plant may not even be able to use

607
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,240
the light that you're providing in the

608
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,240
growth chamber

609
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,798
itself switch gears a little bit with

610
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,200
succulents there's a lot of interest in

611
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:28,079
succulents this is just to

612
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,200
show this is a crown of thorns and suck

613
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,839
respond as other plants to increasing

614
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,960
CO2 this is during the

615
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:40,158
day now there are plants the this is

616
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,240
aaria and aeonium these take up CO2 at

617
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:47,039
night not all what we consider to be

618
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,319
Camp plants actually do take up CO2 at

619
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,038
night we study a number of cacti and

620
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,960
they're taking up CO2 during the day in

621
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,720
many cases the assumption is that

622
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,440
they're only taking CO2 up at night and

623
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,480
that's not the case also orchids

624
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,399
phenopsis orchids will take up CO2

625
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,360
during the day but this is frag

626
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,119
midium and this is the beginning of the

627
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,158
night and this is CO2 uptake and you can

628
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,479
see pretty clearly that this Orchid

629
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,440
takes up CO2 at night only suggesting if

630
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,798
you're producing this Orchid that you

631
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,200
should actually be injecting CO2 at

632
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,000
night so there's

633
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,759
differences I'm going to move along

634
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,159
quick high temperature slowing of

635
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,640
development rate Leaf unfolding rate

636
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,360
this is an old graph I've used from

637
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,880
African Violets follows this standard

638
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,158
line so this is pretty common curve for

639
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,600
lots of plants we have we have an

640
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,720
optimal temperature and frankly Leaf

641
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:45,639
unfolding rate often is optimized around

642
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,720
right around 85 degrees

643
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,960
Celsius and this was developed here's

644
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,399
African violet you can see Leaf number

645
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,120
increasing up to here and then you can

646
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,319
see a decrease and this is what I want

647
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,959
to focus

648
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,038
on because we have decreases this for

649
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,600
whatever reason this temperature is

650
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,038
almost Sentinel to lots of things this

651
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,319
is melon fly egg development and doesn't

652
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,480
it look an awful lot like the graph we

653
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,398
just

654
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,319
saw but my point is this when the

655
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,519
temperature exceeds the Optima which in

656
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,879
Greenhouse production it commonly does

657
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,599
we actually slow the rate of leaf

658
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,480
unfolding and slow the crop down in its

659
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,480
development rate

660
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:28,679
okay these hot temperatures and right

661
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,038
now your leaf temperatures remember one

662
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,080
thing if it's 85° in the greenhouse your

663
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,319
Leaf temperature is above 90 and

664
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,398
approaching 95 you were actually on the

665
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,639
other end of that curve and your crop is

666
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,639
actually starting to slow it'll take

667
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,919
longer to flower it's underappreciated

668
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,278
area using the standard curve if we go

669
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,840
from 85 to 95 that same plant to unfold

670
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:55,200
one leaf will now Take 5 days instead of

671
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,599
3.3 you've slowed Leaf unfolding

672
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,120
approximately by a

673
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,119
third

674
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:03,239
so to come back again we have a number

675
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,199
of crops that are down in this area and

676
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,798
we have temperatures that are routinely

677
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,278
going from 20 up to 35 C and we are

678
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,599
routinely decreasing photosynthesis as

679
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,398
part of that process and we're routinely

680
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,240
decreasing the leaf unfolding rate and

681
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:18,239
actually slowing the crop development in

682
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,038
that

683
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,120
process and we are routinely closing our

684
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:26,278
stamata and someone was talking about

685
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,239
Edge burn on

686
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,599
lettuce well high temperatures

687
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,038
encouraging Leed burn on lettuce um you

688
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,439
can kind of understand where that comes

689
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:34,640
from if the stomates are closing of

690
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,919
course the plant is going to have

691
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,759
difficulty taking up calcium in that

692
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,960
scenario now we've gone through all

693
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,679
different kinds of crops I'm not going

694
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,480
to go through this and identified what

695
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,399
happens if you decrease

696
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,278
temperatures and the timing of that and

697
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:49,319
then we've integrated that into a

698
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,880
package that everyone has access to and

699
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,158
if you if any of you haven't tried this

700
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,760
program it's a wonderful program it's

701
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,960
called virtual grower it's free for

702
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,240
everyone USDA has it it's used for

703
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,919
modeling crop growth temperature you can

704
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
literally take your greenhouse and

705
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,600
identify how much more it's going to

706
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,480
cost if you switch the outer covering on

707
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:09,359
the greenhouse or not so that's how we

708
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,880
pull it together the last thing is

709
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,199
biotic

710
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,240
stresses I think most of us appreciate

711
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,200
that when a plant is attacked it

712
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,480
releases volatiles that go to other

713
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,480
plants sometimes within the same species

714
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,558
sometimes other species and tell that

715
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,399
plant that it's being attacked plants

716
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,200
communicate via volatiles

717
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,079
there's a plant this is from data that

718
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,840
is not mine from 2001 this is showing

719
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,558
allness that's uninfested and here's an

720
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,079
nness that is infested and here's the GC

721
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,558
depicting the

722
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:47,278
dramatic expression and variety of

723
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,278
volatiles that are produced after

724
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,319
infestation this is also a recent

725
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,960
picture just showing you the the degree

726
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,158
to the sophistication this is a recent

727
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,319
paper so the insect lays an egg this is

728
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,960
on a rabbit opsis that egg actually

729
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,079
produces a compound that stimulates

730
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,319
salicylic acid which is antagonistic the

731
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,119
jasmonic

732
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,879
acid okay so this actually creates a

733
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,398
system where the plant is not able to

734
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,559
defend itself so when the larv does

735
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:17,119
hatch the plant doesn't know it's being

736
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:19,558
attacked and is

737
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,398
defenseless started looking at what

738
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:24,079
happens if we expose plants to methyl

739
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:26,319
Jasmin one of the primary volatil that

740
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,599
plants give off

741
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,639
to warn that an attack has been made

742
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,119
what we did is we would

743
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,880
treat plants okay with methyl Jasmin and

744
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:41,278
then we would infest them with mites

745
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,840
okay and this is how many mites fled

746
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,599
fled the plants okay so you'll see that

747
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,158
in each case a plant that was exposed to

748
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:52,000
methyl Jasmin okay and this was for a

749
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,039
single hour resulted in a plant that

750
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,558
when you would put mites on it the mites

751
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,879
would

752
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,839
flee okay compared to the the

753
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,840
control also if we qu

754
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,959
Quantified if we come back to the Tomato

755
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:10,439
you'll notice the Tomato had significant

756
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,558
effect if we look at we quantify Proteus

757
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,080
Inhibitors which is one of the purported

758
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,678
responses that plants have in meth in

759
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,960
response to methyl Jasmin you'll see

760
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,278
with that with tomato that as methyl

761
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,319
Jasmin concentration went up or exposure

762
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,240
went up the plant produced more proteas

763
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:28,918
inhibitor in response to

764
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,200
that if we take that

765
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,399
further this is the number of mites that

766
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,240
were on the plant okay after a period of

767
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,079
3 weeks and you can see that in any case

768
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,960
whenever there was a plant that was

769
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:46,359
exposed to methyl Jasmine it had fewer

770
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,319
mites that was the same case for aphids

771
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:51,839
notice the control we had 22 this is

772
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,558
after 11 days with aphids 22 aphids we

773
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,599
had methyl silicate but Noti methyl

774
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,319
Jasmin we had a fraction of that we had

775
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,079
eight in that case

776
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,038
this is just a representation of some of

777
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,558
the work that we have but clearly in all

778
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,759
the studies we did after plant was

779
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,519
exposed to methyl Jasmin it actually not

780
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,480
only did the plants or insects try to

781
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,720
flee it but they actually proliferated

782
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,759
less now predation of any kind and

783
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,839
activation of plant defenses has a cost

784
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,480
for plants and so actually when you turn

785
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,959
on plant

786
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,120
defenses if that plant will actually

787
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,558
have less dry weight than a plant

788
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,558
adjacent to it if the defenses are

789
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:34,079
turned on the plant is spending a lot of

790
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:37,119
effort actually producing compounds to

791
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:40,119
defend itself at the expense of other

792
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,798
materials so there's a cost to this and

793
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,719
something that's also very interesting

794
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,839
is

795
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,399
that if you look at different kinds of

796
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:51,678
wounding responses you'll only

797
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:54,879
see response okay to a caterpillar not a

798
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,480
tearing saying that somehow the plant

799
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,799
recognizes a pest I don't know why this

800
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,360
is blurred on this one okay but the

801
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:06,000
bottom line is fac is

802
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,759
actually caterpillar

803
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,880
spit okay the plant actually perceives

804
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,119
the saliva from the

805
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,159
caterpillar and that's what causes the

806
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,518
chain reaction and response it's very

807
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,360
very specific so we're in the process

808
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,839
right now of actually determining

809
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:24,918
whether plants have vocabulary because I

810
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,720
think that the response to a white fly

811
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,679
may be different than an apid which may

812
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,159
be different than a might so we're

813
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,559
looking at those areas I will be very

814
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,080
brief new directions we're doing a lot

815
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:36,918
of new crop work this is with South

816
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,398
Africa this gives you an idea of some of

817
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,480
the gladiolas that exist in South Africa

818
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:43,759
we do ve we have very little gladiola

819
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,278
species in the United States we're doing

820
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,720
work with Cactus and succulents where we

821
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:49,759
we think that they can be new bedding

822
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,880
plants or new potted plants and we've

823
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,798
been identifying plants and protocols to

824
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,440
get cactin succulents to flour when we

825
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,558
want them to so you can have them

826
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,120
blooming all year year doing the same

827
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,759
with succulents of different

828
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,518
kinds then we identify protocols you can

829
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,839
pretty clearly see there when photo

830
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,558
period exceeds 12 hours with all those

831
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,439
species these are each calanchos that

832
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,440
they remain vegetative that if the photo

833
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,600
period is less than 13 hours they're

834
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,360
reproductive we've done a large project

835
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,839
on green roofs in the midwest because

836
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,678
the green roof work that's been done in

837
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,359
Baltimore and the east coast in Chicago

838
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,480
and Toronto doesn't apply to the Midwest

839
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,319
so we screened 78 species over a series

840
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,120
of years and identified what plants will

841
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,638
survive on a green roof in the

842
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:40,158
midwest work it's a crazy project on

843
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:42,199
grafted cactus okay someone say there

844
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,159
aren't many grafted cactus you're wrong

845
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,960
there's a lot of grafted cactus that are

846
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,639
in the world okay each of these

847
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,558
cacti is on a different root stock it's

848
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:55,678
the same Scion so the effect you see is

849
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,158
purely a root stock response there's a

850
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,320
lot of in lot of potential for this as

851
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,440
far as expanding the crop pallet there

852
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:06,638
is some interest in aquaponics I will

853
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,200
just mention a couple things there's a

854
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:10,279
difficult area we talked this morning

855
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,078
about how you have to optimize you have

856
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,159
to optimize the fish number that will

857
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,480
survive you have to optimize how many

858
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:22,119
plants a fish can fish population can um

859
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,440
support and then as the plants grow the

860
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,879
conditions that you have changes and the

861
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,559
market you know PE people are getting

862
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,679
tired of tilapia there's only so much

863
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,799
tilapia you can eat

864
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,639
right okay so and we think like we have

865
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,119
the Schlitz Brewery is converting into a

866
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,200
giant aquaculture facility in

867
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,960
Minneapolis they're going to be

868
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,719
producing more tilapia than we know what

869
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,240
to do with the interest in AR Growers is

870
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:49,000
frankly an alternative um aquaponic

871
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,799
crops and so what's an alternative crop

872
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,760
this is what's called a red claw which

873
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,839
it has no red claw it has a blue claw I

874
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
don't know why they call it red claw but

875
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,599
it's a large freshwood Lobster it's

876
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,358
actually a crayfish that gets a really

877
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,240
big tail from Thailand shrimp crabs and

878
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,078
freshwater oysters there's a lot more

879
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:08,919
interest in this and the restaurants in

880
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,760
the Minneapolis area are very interested

881
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,159
in this and there are some that have

882
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,599
some of these crazy systems where there

883
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:18,199
are fish at the

884
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,760
bottom this is LEDs in the center okay

885
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,078
and this is lettuce in this case but

886
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,200
actually they've switched to basil and

887
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:28,320
this

888
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:31,279
rotates okay okay my question was

889
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,320
why why not just gr B grow basil in the

890
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,960
greenhouse someplace it'd be a lot

891
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,760
cheaper but they they effectively do

892
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,639
this um and so it works and the the last

893
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,800
picture is this contraption which is

894
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:49,719
actually in California from two weeks

895
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:53,880
ago and someone has to identify

896
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,879
protocols for these guys this is Tom and

897
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,719
Jerry The Tom and Jerry work and they

898
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:01,679
see each other so they don't ever smash

899
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,399
into each

900
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,440
other and what they're doing is they're

901
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,200
spacing

902
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,280
plants so those guys will work for six

903
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,480
hours okay and then you put a new

904
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,560
battery pack in and then they going to

905
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,280
keep going there's no overtime there's

906
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:21,480
no Health Care there's no there's no

907
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,079
complaints but someone has to program

908
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,559
this thing about what a plant looks like

909
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,800
and what to do and there's actually a

910
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,480
project we're looking at this is a these

911
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:35,359
little helicopters with a little tank of

912
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,679
pesticide and the helicopters will fly

913
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,199
they will recognize an aphid and then

914
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,519
Spritz it and the intent is to use it in

915
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:46,318
Orchards so that these things will

916
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:46,318
Target Target the shoe

917
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,040
tips

918
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,680
so so in Minnesota none of the water

919
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:55,318
flows it all just sits like this in

920
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,759
these big mosquito pools but this is

921
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:59,199
land I have but any anyway I'll answer

922
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,359
any questions you may have I was

923
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,719
supposed to get done by one and I am

924
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,719
done 20 seconds

925
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:09,919
[Applause]

926
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:12,880
early

927
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,760
yes in some of your early slides you

928
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,680
showed photo excuse me you showed starel

929
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:24,960
conductance data uh the lore also

930
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:27,759
calculated CI internal CO2 what did that

931
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,400
look like and our stomate it's actually

932
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,480
optimizing their conductance to maintain

933
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,559
a constant CI so that they're not that's

934
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,719
a good question that's a good question

935
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,759
um we didn't find that to be the case we

936
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:43,559
didn't find that to be the case and the

937
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,640
other thing I wonder about is that you

938
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,318
know that as you increase CO2 let's say

939
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,279
in a tomato Greenhouse or something the

940
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:52,639
stomates actually close down size they

941
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,599
get smaller to accommodate some of what

942
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,159
you're talking about

943
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,920
um

944
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:01,519
but I don't know what impact that has on

945
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,559
on actual photosynthesis I still believe

946
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,679
that there's a

947
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,239
decrease and the short-term heat stress

948
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,118
we saw that

949
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:12,639
lag seems to support that there's some

950
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:14,358
sort of response that a plant has that

951
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:17,719
some of these plants are responding to

952
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:19,279
something and I assume it's ABA so so

953
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,078
the next step would be actually to look

954
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,839
at some mutants a to to look and see

955
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,560
what sort of response happens within

956
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,960
those muts themselves but as far as

957
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,599
interal CI we didn't find the

958
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,000
optimization or tried to get a constant

959
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,559
internal CI that was not the case but

960
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,559
yes we use the

961
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,719
light yes could the difference is the

962
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,400
internal CI explain why you were seeing

963
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,078
different right response Curves in the

964
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,039
same the same which could the

965
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,079
differences in the internal CI be

966
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,199
explaining why you were getting

967
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,079
different light response curves where

968
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:56,559
you had power versus PN with the same

969
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,800
you mean withy yeah the same species

970
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,880
different

971
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,119
writings how would you explain I don't

972
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,358
know I'd have to look I mean there seem

973
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,838
there clearly is inherent differences

974
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:09,039
probably from you know from the

975
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:12,318
parentage of these different cult bars

976
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,400
that impose the maximum rate that can

977
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:16,679
occur so I assume it's related to the

978
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,559
parentage because if you take a group of

979
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,000
species you'll find within that group of

980
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,759
species of within a Genus that they'll

981
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,239
be different maximum

982
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,560
levels you know maximum the animals that

983
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,719
you can

984
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:36,838
achieve does that make any sense

985
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:40,679
yeah related to that what you showed

986
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:44,119
were CO2 responses or or photosynthetic

987
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:47,719
responses that were parallel essentially

988
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,519
throughout the temperature range testing

989
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,799
so there must be some it wasn't just a

990
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,400
heat shutdown that was occurring uh for

991
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,200
the resistant versus the the yeah they

992
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,000
were

993
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,000
so there must be

994
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:13,358
some

995
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,280
humidity experim yeah with the liquor we

996
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,078
actually you can set a a specific

997
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,079
humidity level and

998
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,920
maintain B pressure deficit so you don't

999
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,519
so you can set it so that it doesn't

1000
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,519
compound the

1001
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:31,119
data action heat temperature yeah there

1002
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,559
is there is very much with the vapor

1003
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,440
pressure deficit but that actually

1004
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:38,400
accommodates like

1005
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,599
actually and also did you measure Ava

1006
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,400
critical level no we didn't measure Ava

1007
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,119
um the assumption is because we're

1008
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,838
seeing the guard cells clo you know

1009
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,800
closure of the stomates that Ava is

1010
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:51,838
somehow involved with the process but

1011
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,440
there's no evidence to confirming and

1012
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:59,440
also no interaction for k+ and C++

1013
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,720
deficiency or those no we didn't look we

1014
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
didn't look for nutrient deficiencies

1015
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,199
they were treated the same and the

1016
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,200
responses were as you saw almost

1017
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,199
immediate in some cases

1018
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:17,760
so another question related to the Heat

1019
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:20,559
and shade often times Growers would say

1020
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,280
oh it's it's too hot so I'm going to put

1021
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,000
the shade down in the greenhouse and so

1022
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,480
what do you tell them now okay heat is

1023
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,880
bad but shade is also bad so what should

1024
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,199
they be doing you know with the Tomato

1025
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,599
greenhouse and the rose Greenhouse this

1026
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,519
started with the rose Greenhouse we told

1027
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,680
them to shut the shade system

1028
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,880
down and when they shut the shade system

1029
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:42,759
down guess what happened to the blind

1030
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,760
shoot percentage in the summer it

1031
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,200
dramatically dropped and the blind

1032
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,480
shoots they were having they weren't

1033
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:52,039
having so it solved the problem

1034
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,719
actually so there wasn't any problem

1035
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,880
with the pl well the the the no not

1036
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,959
let's just put it this way the heat

1037
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,720
problem with the plants wasn't as bad as

1038
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,599
the shade problem okay the shade was

1039
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:10,879
more limiting than high temperature

1040
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:13,640
reduction okay did it occur yeah so and

1041
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,400
we have Rose data to show that it wasn't

1042
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,239
but the shade where you saw I think just

1043
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,400
in one example with impatience it

1044
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:25,519
dropped lights down to nearly

1045
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,639
third what about the period of Life

1046
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:33,400
exposure not low light but highl because

1047
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:36,598
Bob Lang hands when he was here told me

1048
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,160
that you had to put the shade over 5:00

1049
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,760
on luses because otherwise they had too

1050
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:45,358
much light the period of photosynthesis

1051
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,839
was too long to me this didn't make

1052
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,400
sense but that's what he claimed now do

1053
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,960
you think that was the time for pH

1054
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,519
synthesis or was he in fact dropping the

1055
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,280
temperature in some way maybe here to

1056
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,199
defend himself have have you done any

1057
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,720
experiments with the perod of

1058
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,838
highlight

1059
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,959
no I have not we haven't done that and I

1060
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,880
don't see a rationale for it no I I

1061
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,199
didn't see a rationale but the heat SW

1062
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,838
up you put shade over 5m where where

1063
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,318
there is a stress that I think occurs on

1064
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,838
crops that we don't appreciate is

1065
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,400
actually in the morning and you might be

1066
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:25,078
aware of work done with photosynthetic

1067
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,318
depression or in that case it's actually

1068
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,119
damaged to the photos apparatus when you

1069
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:33,279
have bright light and cool

1070
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,880
temperatures in England in fact uh they

1071
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,880
were able to attribute whether the corn

1072
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,480
crop made it or not was associated with

1073
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,358
how many cool bright mornings they had

1074
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,159
there's actual clear photosynthetic

1075
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:47,318
damage it's at the University of

1076
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:49,519
Essex I don't know how often that occurs

1077
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:51,480
in our crops okay we typically don't let

1078
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,759
our crops getting cold but in some

1079
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,079
locations they do and that actually

1080
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,680
causes suppression long-term supression

1081
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,160
as well cool and bright when we do our

1082
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,480
temperature drop for stem elongation I

1083
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,118
think the yellowing that we see is

1084
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,599
actually that Co temperature damage to

1085
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,599
the pH

1086
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,280
system what of the Takeo messages I got

1087
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,039
from your talk is that a greenhouse

1088
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,200
while it's a controlled environment it's

1089
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:23,358
still an imperfect place to grow plants

1090
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,759
it's hard to you could do a lot more to

1091
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:29,400
optimize carbon dioxide optim

1092
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,000
light and optimized temperature then at

1093
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,720
the end of your talk you showed

1094
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,239
interesting slide with this rotating

1095
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,000
drum and

1096
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,679
plant which I think is pretty

1097
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,838
unrealistic but maybe maybe it's not so

1098
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,480
unrealistic to think about Factory like

1099
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,119
Warehouse growing if you could optimize

1100
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,920
all of those conditions maybe it could

1101
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:51,079
be economically feasible well Bob worked

1102
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,760
on this for a while right was interested

1103
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,200
in this for quite some time and I think

1104
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,000
it is possible to do it it's just

1105
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:01,279
whether it's cost efficient to do it

1106
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,599
okay the first thing I would do frankly

1107
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,400
and we're in the process of doing this

1108
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,440
at the University now this room is warm

1109
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,160
and it's comfortable because the

1110
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,920
thermostat for all of us is right here

1111
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:12,639
okay so the first thing is to take the

1112
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,920
light sensors and all the sensors

1113
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,519
associated with plant growth and put

1114
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,720
them where the plants are okay then when

1115
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,318
so that's the first thing I would do as

1116
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,799
far as L the other thing is I would find

1117
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,480
out where your actual light levels are

1118
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,559
because I bet you in NE grow Chambers

1119
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,159
name GRE houses you are suppressing

1120
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,160
growth more than what you

1121
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,440
appreciate and I think that's occurring

1122
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:34,000
across the board and I think it's

1123
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,280
occurring in growth

1124
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,559
Chambers um as far as factory production

1125
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,079
there are definitely there are places

1126
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,960
that want to do factory production but

1127
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,400
in many cases it frankly is a lot

1128
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,039
cheaper to just do traditional

1129
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,039
production and I don't see the economics

1130
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:51,880
to do factory production yet as long as

1131
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,639
you

1132
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,880
have accessible land in Minneapolis if

1133
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,879
you drive 30 minutes you're in open

1134
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,200
Farmland you really need to spend all

1135
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,880
the money to do an intensive system in a

1136
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,358
factory when you can have a

1137
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,920
non-intensive system that may be more C

1138
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:12,480
effective 30 minutes away I don't think

1139
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,480
to say that but it's

1140
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,240
reality those green houses with

1141
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,559
deficiency of light system within the

1142
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:25,519
canopy uh with the future of new

1143
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,440
technology LED light system is it going

1144
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,280
to

1145
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,280
solution for that well you can create an

1146
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,040
optimal environment at the plant LEL you

1147
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,640
just need to know what the parameters

1148
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,759
are that you need the question is

1149
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,838
whether it's going to be

1150
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,599
economical right I mean that's that's a

1151
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,279
separate question because what I'm

1152
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,640
telling you is our plant probably could

1153
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,920
use more light what we're giving them

1154
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,239
some point may be economical and some

1155
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,880
point not so that it's and it's going to

1156
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,519
be different you know frankly we just

1157
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,280
discussed this before in New Hampshire

1158
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,119
the cost of electricity is 12.2 cents

1159
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,000
per Kow in Minneapolis is 3 and half

1160
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,838
cents per kilowatt our economics are

1161
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,079
very

1162
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,078
different for

1163
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:10,039
lighting CO2 you had some CO2 graphs but

1164
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,318
I don't know if you mentioned the period

1165
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:14,480
or the time that was done because there

1166
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,639
are some experiments which show that if

1167
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,119
you got a shortterm bursting growth but

1168
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:23,039
if you have the CO2 present all the time

1169
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:26,079
there's an acclamation that it comes

1170
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,639
back it was before so have you found in

1171
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,960
your that's a very good question the

1172
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,159
answer is is no because frankly the

1173
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,920
basis for adding CO2 to tomato green

1174
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,480
houses and the increase in yield is

1175
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,280
because they did a permanent increase in

1176
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,559
photosynthesis but what we're looking at

1177
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,519
is acclamation right now that bur and

1178
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,000
that 2-hour high temperature pulse we're

1179
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,119
looking at if we do it periodically

1180
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,760
whether the plant doesn't depress but

1181
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:55,280
actually adapts to that so we're we're

1182
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:58,000
we're doing that actually right now but

1183
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,559
um think it's a good point plan to do

1184
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,838
acclimate um there was actually a recent

1185
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,880
paper and rabbit opsis related to this

1186
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:11,199
and they found that rabbit offices did

1187
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,200
not that it was just perally

1188
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,838
increased we have any more time other

1189
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,460
questions for

1190
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:23,288
John all right let's

1191
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,289
