1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,350
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,349
University

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,120
so as Don mentioned I'm with the USDA I

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:14,039
am a research geneticist and I

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,000
specialize in abiotic stress physiology

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:21,269
and genetics in grape and grape is the

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,849
topic of today so grapes are one of the

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,669
leading horticultural fruits across the

9
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:28,199
globe and they're good to eat but their

10
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:32,070
end products are also really important

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,920
at lucrative juice raisins table grapes

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,810
and of course wine the thing that limits

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,370
grape vine is a narrow climatic band the

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,740
cultivated grape vine is a Mediterranean

15
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,769
adapted species and so if you look here

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,410
pictured on the map and try to get my

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,600
orientation with which slides to look at

18
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:53,759
if you look it is limited by a

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,710
temperature range between 10 and 20

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,449
degrees Celsius which captures the

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,070
Mediterranean area and then grape vine

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,410
producing areas you're probably familiar

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,840
with when it comes to wine California

24
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,840
Chile Argentina South Africa Australia

25
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:12,330
but we know that climate is changing and

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,189
there are new challenges emerging when

27
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,260
it comes to grape vine production so

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,569
pictured here in red are grape vine

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,840
regions that we currently have that were

30
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,939
expected to lose by 2050 the blue region

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,740
there those are in red the blue regions

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,239
are areas that we expect grape vine

33
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,009
production to be able to expand into

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:33,780
typically because of a warming climate

35
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,400
so with climate change we're expecting

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,409
four winters to become slightly warmer

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,020
but we're also expecting to have altered

38
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,700
weather patterns and so those altered

39
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,340
weather patterns do not remove the

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,750
threat of cold temperatures and

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,920
limitations to grapevine production

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,659
because I think we're all familiar with

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,118
if you were here in the last couple

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,450
years the polar vortex which is a very

45
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,040
common climatic event but one that we

46
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,780
just haven't seen in a while and so

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,780
pictured here is a heat map showing that

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,629
that polar vortexes believe this as two

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,739
years ago the temperature stove down

50
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:07,349
caused a lot of damage and grapevines

51
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,449
both here in New York and as well as in

52
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,658
the Midwest and it was just at a

53
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,848
conference where all of the producers

54
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:16,498
and all the winemakers are cold climate

55
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,829
grapevine producers so coming from

56
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:19,930
Scandinavia Canada

57
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,120
kind of thing we had a meteorologist to

58
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,370
give a talk about the polar vortex and

59
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,230
about climate change and he did a really

60
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,550
great job of explaining it and so I

61
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,989
thought I'd include that here just so

62
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,360
everybody has an understanding about how

63
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,100
that affects growing grapes in this

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,890
region growing grapes in areas where

65
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:38,979
climate is not a Mediterranean so the

66
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:41,199
traditional climate has a very cold pole

67
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:43,479
and very strong trade winds which keep

68
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,789
cold air during winter trapped at the

69
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,799
pole but as we experience warming and

70
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:50,530
preferential warming in the poles the

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,710
trade winds get weaker and then these

72
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,870
polar troughs become more regular as

73
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,570
cold air is able to slip out of the

74
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,159
poles and dip down into areas where we

75
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,409
were not traditionally experiencing such

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,409
cold snaps the flipside of that is

77
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:07,509
there's also warming Peaks that occur in

78
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:10,359
contrast for that so instead of a

79
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:11,919
generally warmer winter we're faced with

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,840
a more erratic winter where there are

81
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,489
going to be episodes of much warmer

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,650
temperature followed by episodes of much

83
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,750
colder temperature this wreaks a lot of

84
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,959
havoc on grapevines particularly when

85
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,830
you're pushing the temperature envelope

86
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,900
picture down here on the bottom is

87
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,580
another example of some of this weather

88
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,599
phenomenon as it affects horticultural

89
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,750
crops the bottom panel here is a picture

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,289
of the Midwest of America in April of

91
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,509
2006 and all right so this is like April

92
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,669
fourth this is April 22nd so you can see

93
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,379
the greening up that's the the trees and

94
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:47,738
article culture of crops all bursting

95
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:49,840
breaking bud in the previous are in this

96
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,430
year 2007 we experienced what was a

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,439
portal polar vortex although we

98
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,420
experienced it in the spring so you can

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,120
see how far advanced the green was when

100
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:00,369
you compare these two and then after the

101
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,200
polar vortex or the spring freeze you

102
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,719
can see how much of that foliage died

103
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,669
back in 2007 I don't even know the

104
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,959
billions of dollars that were lost in

105
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,000
horticultural crops because of this

106
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,269
event so these events are expected to

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,269
increase

108
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,769
but it's not always necessarily bad news

109
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:19,599
with climate change is also new

110
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,699
opportunities and I'm from the Upper

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,199
Peninsula of Michigan which is this

112
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,490
Peninsula here most people don't realize

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
that this is actually attached to

114
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,379
Michigan from this corner here I was

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,539
very surprised to see that grapevine

116
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:33,879
production is moving north in Michigan

117
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,470
so here along the coast of Michigan

118
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,659
there's a lot of wine trails a lot of

119
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,330
good hybrid and vanilla wines get made

120
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,540
here but now this little Peninsula here

121
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,909
there's a winery there and as you can

122
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,750
see by the suitability map there there

123
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,250
are some regions where they're

124
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,959
projecting that is more suitable for

125
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,310
wine I can tell you from the snowfall

126
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,279
levels that this is not going to be a

127
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,199
fun place to grow grapes but we have to

128
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,219
realize that there are challenges coming

129
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,379
with climate change there's also

130
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,990
opportunities and so is my job as a

131
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,939
geneticist with studying cold hardiness

132
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,168
in grapes to try to figure out the most

133
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,519
efficient way to get us through the

134
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:10,719
challenges and take advantage of the

135
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:12,668
opportunities we look at New York where

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,370
we're all familiar with picture on the

137
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:16,750
left is the grape growing regions of New

138
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,870
York and pictured on the right is the

139
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,769
hardiness map put up at the USDA you'll

140
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,810
notice that there's a correlation

141
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,279
between the dark purple areas on the

142
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,110
left with the green areas on the right

143
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,638
that's because temperature is the

144
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,680
primary limiting factor affecting

145
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,470
production agriculture production in

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,120
general but definitely great production

147
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,160
as I said the European grape vine is

148
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,199
adapted to Mediterranean climates so it

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,099
likes it nice and hot in the summer and

150
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,750
dry and mild and cool in the winter

151
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:45,629
because of that evolutionary history it

152
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,889
isn't adapted to deal with our winters

153
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,228
and particularly if you go further north

154
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,389
or west and north from here cannot deal

155
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:55,509
with the winters it is only cold hardy

156
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,939
to around negative 22 negative 25 C

157
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,709
which is negative 4 to negative 13 F and

158
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:02,889
I'll apologize right now not all of my

159
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,909
slides have C and F included but this is

160
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,788
the range we're looking at for

161
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,200
cultivated grapevine our most Hardy

162
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:10,810
cultivars in this region are like

163
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,478
Riesling and cap frog caps table they

164
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,449
can survive to these temperatures

165
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,550
so that's sort of the backdrop against

166
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,889
what my job is about and the goals of my

167
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,050
position are to understand and clarify

168
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,300
what the physiology is and what the

169
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,629
phenotype is of what what we say cold

170
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,908
hardiness so what does that mean I'm

171
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:32,949
also supposed to identify wild and

172
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:34,598
hybrid germ plasm that we can use to

173
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,028
advance grape I'm breeding to make new

174
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,889
varieties that are better adapted I'm

175
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:40,509
supposed to characterize the complex

176
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,389
architecture of those genetic

177
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,550
architecture of those traits and then

178
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,960
assess genetic mapping populations in

179
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,360
order to identify candidate genes that

180
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,908
play major roles so I have a number of

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,710
tools that I can use most importantly is

182
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,990
the USC a cold hardy grapevine germ

183
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,120
plasm which if you don't know we house

184
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,788
in Geneva it's about 1,300 different

185
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,949
grapevine genotypes those are all cold

186
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:05,259
hardy hybrids and wild grapevine species

187
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,509
that can survive our winters the other

188
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,098
half of the grapevine gene germplasm is

189
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,960
in davis california where all of the

190
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:12,788
cultivated varieties and cold sensitive

191
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,918
varieties are kept we have a pretty

192
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:16,058
amazing resource here and I definitely

193
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,490
stressed you should check it out

194
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,229
sometime I perform a lot of

195
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,300
physiological measurements of Grapevine

196
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:24,668
bud survival and phenology with both

197
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,468
field and lab based work and I'm trying

198
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:28,628
to employ next-generation DNA and RNA

199
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:30,519
sequencing technologies to move it

200
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,939
forward to identify the the complexities

201
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,408
behind these traits so I've already kind

202
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,028
of alluded to this but wild Vitus is

203
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:40,870
very important to grapevine improvement

204
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:42,879
I listed here just a sampling of

205
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,370
adaptive traits that we would really

206
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,930
like to have in cultivated varieties

207
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,788
that we can find in abundance and wild

208
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,069
species so we're talking about cold

209
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:52,800
resistance today but there's also

210
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,749
differences in soil adaptability rooting

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,778
pathogen resistance ripening differences

212
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:01,778
in vine architecture fruit flavors and

213
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:03,129
nutrition and then bubbler a bud burst

214
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:05,879
and d acclamation which I'll talk about

215
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,879
a little bit today too

216
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,800
these are the major wild species that we

217
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,730
have in the the cold hardy germplasm

218
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,009
here there

219
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,189
there are about 20 wild species in North

220
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,719
America and I'm picturing a few here and

221
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,009
introducing their names not expecting

222
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,300
you to know them all but just to give

223
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,399
you a sampling of the diversity that we

224
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,720
see when we look at wild species so

225
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,179
they're all sort of ringed around the

226
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,880
outside with Vitis vinifera Riesling in

227
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,220
the center lebra's Kison area esta

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,720
vollis ripe area Rupe estrus and volpina

229
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,288
are all major species we have in the

230
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,538
germplasm

231
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:38,949
but as Amy rensis is something from

232
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:40,750
eastern Asia that's used a lot in

233
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,240
Russian and Chinese great breeding

234
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,590
efforts and then like I mentioned

235
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,060
benefits in the center so they're

236
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,820
roughly 20 species in North America

237
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:53,259
there's something like 40 in Asia

238
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,850
they're adapted to different abiotic and

239
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,710
biotic stresses because of their

240
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,560
evolutionary path and where the group

241
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,590
where they have e adapted a pictured

242
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,629
here for different distribution maps for

243
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,879
a repast hrus lebra's scenario and ripe

244
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,379
area the bright green is a county level

245
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,389
distribution so you can see that they

246
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:12,610
they differ quite a bit in how prevalent

247
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:16,149
they are and what parts of our country

248
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,100
they cover as I mentioned cultivated

249
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,250
grape is called tender negative 22

250
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,379
negative 25 is its limit whereas cold

251
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,110
hardy wild species can reach negative 35

252
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,480
to negative 40 not much can go below

253
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,820
negative 40 and survive that's that's

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,810
the ultimate temperature for water so

255
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,520
now we're going to talk a little bit

256
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:39,819
about what do I mean by when I say cold

257
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,549
hardiness and cold yeah cool part enos

258
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,350
it's a very complex trait it depends on

259
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,609
which dish you are talking about for

260
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,649
this talk want to be speaking mostly

261
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,870
about garment buds but it also includes

262
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,759
phloem and xylem the lifeblood of the

263
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,200
plant as well as the cambium tissues is

264
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,509
all of these tissues have to deal with

265
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,450
freezing stress in our climate and they

266
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,950
may or may not use the same mechanisms

267
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,480
there are differences in the genes that

268
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,160
contribute to cold hardiness there's

269
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,649
differences in the physiology so whether

270
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:08,709
or not you are able to export water or

271
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,240
increase sugar concentration or modify

272
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,610
with cryo proteins all of this can be

273
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,318
different in these different tissues

274
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,178
and there's also mechanical differences

275
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:17,649
between the tissues and whether or not

276
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:19,149
they can prevent them the movement of

277
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,360
ice so you can have tissue barriers that

278
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,649
block ice propagation in the plant

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,789
there's also multiple versions of cold

280
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,778
hardiness depending on what season

281
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,338
you're talking about

282
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:29,948
so I'm picturing here on the bottom is a

283
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:33,639
time line going from fall through to

284
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:36,248
spring so if you get a very hard cold

285
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,379
frost early in the fall you can knock

286
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:40,720
the vine down and do damage before it's

287
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,519
ready for winter temperatures and thus

288
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,189
impede its ability to survive the rest

289
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,198
of the winter you can have massive cold

290
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:49,088
events during the middle of winter which

291
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:52,149
simply surpass the defenses of the plant

292
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:55,119
and kill the buds or if you have too

293
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,879
warm of a spring you can budburst early

294
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:58,899
and then you're subject to frost damage

295
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,360
depending on like I told you those

296
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,818
troughs and peaks and the weather can

297
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,730
really affect that but fall and spring

298
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:11,318
of but phenology when it comes down to

299
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,569
looking at the winter there's two major

300
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:15,488
groupings whether or not you have a mild

301
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:17,349
or cold winter so the intensity of the

302
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:18,429
winter and then the stability of the

303
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,139
winter whether or not you have very

304
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:24,249
punctuated swings in temperature or you

305
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:25,568
have sustained cold temperatures so

306
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,579
today we're going to talk about two of

307
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,748
all the complexity I introduced where I

308
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:31,418
talked about two portions of it

309
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:34,058
midwinter bud hardiness and endo

310
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:36,068
dormancy and bud burst so on the left is

311
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:38,469
the standard acclamation D acclamation

312
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:40,509
curve associated with plants going

313
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,860
through the winter in the fall they

314
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:44,048
react to changes in light and

315
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,730
temperature gaining cold hardiness and

316
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:47,019
moving down this u so they're

317
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,759
acclimating ahead of freezing

318
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:50,678
temperatures during the middle of winter

319
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,149
they're at their most hardy and then in

320
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:54,249
the spring as temperatures rise they D

321
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,159
acclimate at a rate that is faster than

322
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:59,019
they pack lamented you can assess

323
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,548
whether buds are surviving winter and

324
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,379
where they are on this curve by cutting

325
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:04,298
them and looking for damage so here on

326
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,639
the left is the compound bud of grape a

327
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:10,269
primary bud secondary and tertiary all

328
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,119
are green this bud survives well until

329
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,769
we cut it set up the center bud here has

330
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:16,959
a sustained damage in the primary bud

331
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:19,298
which is brown and the third but here is

332
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,068
completely dead so from a producer's

333
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:22,928
point of view you could get fruit off of

334
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:23,990
this plant you're going to get only

335
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:25,220
vegetative growth

336
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,200
this because the primary but is the

337
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,490
fruitful bud and you don't have any

338
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,580
growth and you're probably going to have

339
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,289
to replace your vine and the dormancy

340
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,430
and bud burst is then another topic we

341
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:37,699
will get into in a minute but basically

342
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:40,009
we assess the state of dormancy and the

343
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,149
ability to grow by taking buds from the

344
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,169
field and putting them into growing

345
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:47,028
conditions and that's what's pictured

346
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:48,409
here on the right the reason that I have

347
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:50,330
these two traits up here is because they

348
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,009
interact and overlap with one another so

349
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,750
throughout the acclamation and the

350
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:55,009
acclimation period you also have changes

351
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,470
in dormancy going on in the background

352
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,629
and so I'm trying to decide or trying to

353
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,509
figure out how interconnected these two

354
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:04,669
different traits are with one another

355
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,370
can we separate them and identify the

356
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:16,179
advanced germ plasm for each of those

357
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:16,179
traits mm-hmm

358
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,339
yeah it's the most sensitive and the

359
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:23,159
thought is that because the floral

360
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,740
tissue has more water but we're working

361
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,230
on that so here's my fifth-grade drawing

362
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,960
of what it's like to be a cell that

363
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,129
experiences cold snaps so we have a cell

364
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,170
on the left and though it's all the good

365
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:36,149
bits on the inside there you have a spy

366
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:37,829
of cold temperature and what from what

367
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,659
we know the cell tries to get rid of as

368
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,240
much free water as possible because free

369
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,149
water freezes so you get ice crystal

370
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,549
ages the ice crystallization between the

371
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:49,470
cells or perhaps just outside the plasma

372
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,879
membrane this sort of freezing is safe

373
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,920
and it occurs at around negative five

374
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,700
degrees Celsius it's called the hte or

375
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:59,909
high temperature exotherm cells that

376
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,980
have this ice form are under stress from

377
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:04,019
that ice but also from dehydration and

378
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,639
membrane fusion so there's a lot of

379
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,879
processes going on when when you have

380
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,980
ice formation as temperatures drop the

381
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,679
buds super cool so they suppress their

382
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,409
ability to freeze to a certain point at

383
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,639
some temperature and this varies

384
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:20,069
throughout the winter and by genotype

385
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,539
that intracellular water can no longer

386
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,000
be kept from freezing and it freezes

387
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,000
that signals the lethal event in the

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,320
cell so at that point the bud is dead

389
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,269
what exactly is happening when that ice

390
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,879
happens we don't quite know we're

391
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,529
working on that too but basically

392
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,320
there's a whole suite of tolerance and

393
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,000
avoidance methods that are postulated to

394
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,190
play a role in this differences in

395
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,789
membranes cryo protective of solutes

396
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,640
chaperones sugars suppression of ice

397
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:49,789
crystal form formation tissue barriers

398
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,620
all of these are thought to play a role

399
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:56,189
we can evaluate where the buds are on

400
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,929
that cold hardiness you using a method

401
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,880
called dt8 differential thermal analysis

402
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,339
and what we do is we take the bud here's

403
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,809
the dormant bud make an incision across

404
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,430
the bud cushion so you hear the

405
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:08,579
cross-section keeping this tissue intact

406
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:10,079
we put it into these trays stack the

407
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,200
trays in a programmable freezer then

408
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,480
slowly freeze the tissue as the

409
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,670
temperatures are decreasing when you hit

410
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,950
the hte that's safe freeze you get a

411
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:21,990
spike of water freezing here

412
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,700
this is a peak of heat and we recognize

413
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,610
that as a change in voltage across these

414
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,110
plates so that's the stay freezing and

415
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,669
then as you continue to drop in

416
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,470
temperature you hit the lethal events

417
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:33,719
and you see the buds dying here and

418
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,160
these little spikes so what we do is all

419
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,710
winter long we go out and collect tissue

420
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,899
put them in these chambers record these

421
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,110
Peaks average the peaks and figure out

422
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,090
what the 50% lethal point is and use

423
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,960
that as a method of measuring where the

424
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,879
buds are on that you so for the last

425
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,980
three years I've done this with seven

426
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,360
different species and about 33 different

427
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,620
genotypes and I'm not going to show you

428
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,899
all of the traces because it's way too

429
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,120
overwhelming but basically what it looks

430
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,779
like is done top right corner here this

431
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,220
is the minimum temperatures in the black

432
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:08,189
jagged line and here's Riesling and

433
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,170
Concord the lines the solid lines are

434
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,580
those LTE's the lethal temperatures and

435
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,979
then the dashed line is just a trend

436
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,690
line so you can see that Concord is

437
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,210
harder than Riesling this is something

438
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,650
we know very well so when we look across

439
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,930
these seven species and all these

440
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,340
genotypes from hardy to tender we

441
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:24,659
basically come up with the result right

442
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,240
Perry and a mere inches are the most

443
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,789
Hardy varieties then the rest of the

444
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,340
wild species are all within there we go

445
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:34,370
all within about a degree of each other

446
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,680
as well as scenario lab Rosco rebuff

447
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,000
repairs in volcana all of the wild

448
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,489
species are harder than the hybrid

449
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,409
varieties and those hybrids are harder

450
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,990
than vinifera so just keep that in your

451
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,399
mind mostly the two ends of this right

452
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,830
Perry and Emma insists are very Hardy

453
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,289
hybrid and vinifera are very tender we

454
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,790
look at 2012 2013 here I'm only showing

455
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,370
you right pairing Emmer insists and

456
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:01,699
hybrids you can see that we had this

457
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,810
black dash line as the freezing point

458
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,640
and these are minimum temperatures so

459
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:07,859
you can see we had a this is a pretty

460
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,720
mild winter temperatures go back and

461
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,578
forth across the freezing point several

462
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,470
times you can see that hybrid I'm your

463
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,119
ensign ripe area are all about equally

464
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,779
hardy but way more Hardy than

465
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,578
temperatures demand after this cold

466
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,740
event you can see a slight dip they're

467
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:27,539
responding to the cold temperatures then

468
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,789
there's a warming event Emmy rents this

469
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,200
response by D acclimating and throughout

470
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,579
the rest of the winter

471
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,380
you have this divergence so this isn't a

472
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:38,579
warm here this is a cold year 2013 2014

473
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,200
you can see that the lines are further

474
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,298
down they're more Hardy in this year and

475
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,909
now the blue line which is the hybrid

476
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,379
line is the least Hardy again you have

477
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:49,380
responses to temperature and D

478
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,070
acclamation all the way through the the

479
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,450
season here is last year which was also

480
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:56,038
a very cold ear but it was a very

481
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,450
different cold ear instead of having

482
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,429
lots of temperature swings throughout

483
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,830
the winter we had extremely cold

484
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,179
temperatures for two months straight so

485
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:06,240
you can see that the lines are much less

486
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,278
wavy and this cold event here pushed all

487
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,220
of the genotypes even the sensitive our

488
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:13,230
hybrid varieties far far harder than we

489
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,210
had seen previously so this is where the

490
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,669
type of winter really matters the last

491
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,169
year's winter that we had pushed hybrid

492
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,730
varieties way past what we would expect

493
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,769
them to normally be able to do simply

494
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,079
because the bright types of temperatures

495
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,980
occurred they were pushed down and kept

496
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,589
down they weren't allowed to die

497
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,240
acclimate so the type of winter

498
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:32,278
determines the extent of bud cold

499
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,558
hardiness as much as the genotype does

500
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,869
and here you can see I drew the dashed

501
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,730
red line to indicate the hardiest point

502
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:40,638
for ripe area and you can see that in

503
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,589
the first year the hardiest point is

504
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:45,058
sensitive relative in the next two years

505
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,069
the point of this being is buds do not

506
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,960
super cool to maximum potential unless

507
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,288
they have to unless they're pushed to do

508
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,329
it

509
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:54,450
so there has to be some sort of active

510
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:56,490
part of this going on here are the other

511
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,659
points for ripe area so you can just see

512
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,509
that it gradually got more and more

513
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:02,669
hardy across the three years assessing

514
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:05,669
quote our bud cold hardiness using LTE

515
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,679
is location and here dependent so this

516
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,940
makes it really hard to use to track

517
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,720
down genetic traits because it's always

518
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,889
changing with the field but I'm still

519
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,839
tasked with figuring out how to breed

520
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:17,129
for this so what's a genetic

521
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,648
architecture of this trait and can we

522
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,750
breed for it to do that I looked at

523
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:25,319
Vitus ripe area so this is that northern

524
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:27,028
North American very adapted cold hardy

525
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,798
wild species you can see here it has a

526
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:30,210
huge distribution and it goes well into

527
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,058
Canada that we just don't track where it

528
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,360
is in Canada so I looked at 43 different

529
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:39,210
varieties of ripe area and I'm gonna go

530
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:42,089
sort of fast through this part just show

531
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,130
you the variation across those 43

532
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:47,009
different individuals so here's 2013

533
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:52,110
2014 coal deer and these are the LTE's

534
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:53,609
for the different ripe areas would you

535
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,259
begin to notice is that they don't all

536
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,789
follow the same pattern so they're not

537
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,589
all responding to temperature the same

538
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,029
way you've got some that are sensitive

539
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:02,609
some that are Hardy some that are

540
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,799
reactive some that are static let's

541
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:08,789
cross the whole year or the whole winter

542
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,289
and here's the most recent winter and

543
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,700
you have the same sort of trend so even

544
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,379
when everybody's pushed as hard as we

545
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,890
can push them you still get a massive

546
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,890
amount of variation it's the end of this

547
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,299
okay so basically at any point in either

548
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:26,129
one of the winters there's ten degrees

549
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,169
Celsius range of variation so we have a

550
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,970
lot of stuff that we can look at for

551
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,289
breeding material and there's great

552
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,000
potential for incorporating some of this

553
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,069
new material into breeding programs that

554
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,259
include ripe area for for grape vine

555
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:39,539
breeding the interesting thing is

556
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,579
northern varieties did not come out as

557
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,369
always the most Hardy so in the first

558
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,470
year here varieties that were harder

559
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,959
than negative 32 degrees Celsius were

560
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,870
from Montreal Montana Ontario and

561
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,360
Illinois Illinois is considered south in

562
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:56,219
this distribution and in last year we

563
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,469
again had lots of northern material but

564
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,509
also Illinois Kansas Nebraska Iowa and

565
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,009
Texas it was really interesting this

566
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,200
trait does not appear to be tied to

567
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:08,160
geography it seems to be locked within

568
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,680
the species okay so now we're gonna move

569
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,750
to the next straight dormancy dormancy

570
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,830
is a process that occurs throughout the

571
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,750
growing season and throughout the

572
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:17,549
dormant season it starts during the

573
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,349
growing season with para dormancy this

574
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,029
is where the tip the growing tip is

575
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:23,009
suppressing the growth of buds behind it

576
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,329
so this is what happens when you prune a

577
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:26,430
plant and it gets really bushy you

578
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:29,460
release it from pair dormancy that's

579
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,289
controlled by hormones the next type of

580
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,210
dormancy is endo dormancy and this is

581
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,940
what occurs in the fall light changes

582
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,940
cold temperatures drop and the Canes and

583
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,620
fruit or canes and vines ripen off so

584
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,930
they turn from green to brown getting

585
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:44,729
woody that's called paradigm it advances

586
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,009
from the base of the cane to the

587
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,620
the cane and as it travels the buds that

588
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:52,919
are covered in that paradigm are ready

589
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,928
for winter we don't know what keeps

590
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,370
these buds in this state of endo

591
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,679
dormancy it's something molecular

592
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,959
metabolic if you go out during the endo

593
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,548
dormant period and hack off a vine stick

594
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,650
it in water and try to get the buds grow

595
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:09,539
it won't burst there's something limit

596
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,460
keeping those buds silent after you

597
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,899
successfully complete endo dormancy you

598
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,400
move on eco dormancy and this is the

599
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,780
state where the temperatures are keeping

600
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,429
the plant dormant so if you go and cut a

601
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:20,099
vine an eco dormant stage and put it in

602
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:23,298
a hot glass of water it'll grow so this

603
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,230
is an environmental form of dormancy

604
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,849
after it gets warm enough and growth

605
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,860
through zooms the plant goes back into

606
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:30,719
the girls season but if it gets there

607
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,879
too fast and we have a frost event then

608
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,250
this happens and we lose the fruit

609
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,150
producing parts of the vine so that's

610
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,650
why this is related to cold hardiness

611
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,929
the way the dormancy clock works is the

612
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,990
buds somehow keep track of the amount of

613
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,970
time that they spend between about 7 or

614
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,849
0 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius

615
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,350
there's an optimum area there they count

616
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:55,859
the hours throughout the whole winter

617
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:59,639
and that's what's depicted here the two

618
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:03,839
winters 2012 and 2013 so warm versus

619
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:07,620
cold in this green shading is that sweet

620
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,899
spot for that dormancy o'clock so the

621
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,250
buds are tracking temperatures

622
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,630
throughout the winter and this tells

623
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,970
them when it's safe to burst in the

624
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,610
spring so I zoomed in here just in the

625
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,110
yellow box on the same dates across

626
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:21,029
those two years the warm winter and the

627
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:23,129
cool winter and if we imagine that we

628
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,928
want to get to 12 o'clock noon before we

629
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,820
burst and look at this region you can

630
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:29,880
see that in the warm winter they made it

631
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:31,379
to 7 o'clock in this chunk of time in

632
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,990
the next year when it was cold they only

633
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,900
made it to 3 what that means is you need

634
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,019
much less warmth on the other side of

635
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,669
this this bracketed area to burst and in

636
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,069
fact in this year you can see that

637
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:45,830
they've got plenty of chilling the buds

638
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:48,019
burst and we got frost damage

639
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,490
and this year this same amount of

640
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:51,769
chilling didn't mean the same amount to

641
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,630
the buds because the clock was slower so

642
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:56,329
it's really important that you grow

643
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,090
things in regions that have C o'clock up

644
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:02,408
12 that you don't grow things that are

645
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:05,209
going to be super charged in that time

646
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,890
this is what the the chilling hour /

647
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,370
dormancy cloth looks like for across the

648
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,320
country

649
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:10,879
if the I'm not sure if you can read

650
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,619
these these numbers or not but it starts

651
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,409
with zero in Florida it never gets below

652
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,119
seven so plants that would grow in

653
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,399
Florida wouldn't need chilling in order

654
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,719
to fulfill their dormancy you gradually

655
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:23,058
gain more dormancy as you move up the

656
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,250
country along the coast where it's cool

657
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:28,730
up in a Pacific Northwest where it's

658
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,558
cool and then up in the northern plains

659
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,880
there's actually very few chilling hours

660
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,038
this is because their temperature swings

661
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,470
are so dramatic they go through from

662
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:39,440
summer to winter so quickly that that

663
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,409
sweet zone is actually very tiny so

664
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,389
that's chilling hours and we can

665
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,100
evaluate what the chilling hour

666
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:47,658
requirement is for different species for

667
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:49,609
different genotypes by simple tests

668
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,860
collecting the vines putting them into

669
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:54,109
cold storage in that sweet spot and then

670
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:55,638
testing how fast they burst and the data

671
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:58,729
looks something like this this is

672
00:24:55,638 --> 00:25:00,079
Cabernet Franc at Sauve and Riesling at

673
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,240
the start of experiment you can see that

674
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,798
they take quite a few days to burst but

675
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,700
as you add chilling they get faster and

676
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:09,679
faster and faster if you take a given

677
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,210
set of hours at a thousand hours here

678
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,190
you can see that Cab Franc and Riesling

679
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,380
our fully chilled and they're bursting

680
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,899
really quickly and caps off is lady

681
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,970
legging behind one of the consequences

682
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:22,699
of not being fully chilled is that you

683
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,169
have desynchronized budburst that leads

684
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,730
to D synchronized flowering and D

685
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,590
synchronized fruit ripening so this is

686
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,909
not a good trait to have you can see

687
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:30,648
here this is Riesling that's fully

688
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,960
chilled this is caps off that's not

689
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:34,509
fully chilled the buds are bursting at

690
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,730
different rates

691
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:39,129
so if we look across a wild grapevine

692
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,259
these are the trends in what the species

693
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,299
do when we're faced with chilling hours

694
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,798
I want you to notice that all the

695
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:47,319
species responded the same way too

696
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,480
chillin there they all need chilling to

697
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,859
burst but they and they have the same

698
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,089
reaction to the same amount of chilling

699
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:56,048
but they start at different spots in the

700
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:58,240
y-intercept and so different species and

701
00:25:56,048 --> 00:26:00,129
genotypes have different chilling

702
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,289
requirements there's low chilled rapid

703
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,620
bud bursting species moderate species

704
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:07,210
and then hide she'll slow species these

705
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,729
tend to separate along a northern

706
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,779
southern gradient as far as

707
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,400
distributions go so it's very

708
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:15,250
interesting we might have an adaptive

709
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,470
trait in this data set so we can select

710
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:21,819
specific germ plasm to breed for these

711
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,620
different traits so if we will look at

712
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:25,509
this in ripe area again we could look at

713
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:27,399
this with 43 lines I'm not going to show

714
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:30,039
you 43 lines I'm just going to show you

715
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,929
a standard ripe area line so this is

716
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,700
ripe areas response to increasing

717
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:35,769
chilling it gets faster and faster for

718
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,860
the bud burst so chilling hours in the

719
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:41,500
are going up here bud burst days on the

720
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:43,418
left this is the maximal range of

721
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,789
variation within the forty-three ripe

722
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,049
areas okay so all of the right Perea

723
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:51,339
lines fall between this blue and this

724
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:53,259
green line what we see is that the

725
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:56,349
steeper the slope is that indicates that

726
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:59,289
that genotype reef responds more to a

727
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,699
given unit of chilling and the position

728
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:02,379
on the y axis indicates the end of

729
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,480
dormancy barrier so the higher you are

730
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,740
on the y axis the more dormant you are

731
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,539
through the winter if we look at if we

732
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,509
imagine we breed with these ripe areas

733
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,769
and then put the hybrids out into North

734
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,359
America where we're growing hybrid

735
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,369
grapes pictured here is North Dakota

736
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,659
Nebraska New York and a chilling hours

737
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:21,819
that you typically receive in those

738
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,650
regions so you can see depending up if

739
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:25,569
you planted the for example the green

740
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,090
variety in all three locations you have

741
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:29,678
very different bud burst rates because

742
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:33,399
they're chilling hours and seasons are

743
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,710
different if you add adapting or climate

744
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,160
change and winter warming to this you

745
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,600
shift these all to the side and so when

746
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,100
you're thinking about breeding for cold

747
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,730
hardiness from a dormancy point of view

748
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,398
you have to be think

749
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,378
way ahead to the shift in climate

750
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,939
there's increase in chilling hours and

751
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:50,888
so now you can see is even more

752
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,499
important which varieties you choose

753
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:57,548
because the faster you break bud the

754
00:27:53,499 --> 00:28:02,169
more susceptible to frost you are and

755
00:27:57,548 --> 00:28:04,808
this is the 43 different genotypes of

756
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:07,629
ripe area yellow is southern I've called

757
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,428
them southern blue is northern in the

758
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,868
two columns is the average LTE for the

759
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,369
two years I showed you you can see that

760
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:14,949
there is no apparent trend between

761
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:16,749
darker red with northern or southern the

762
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,798
LTE trade is sort of shared across all

763
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:23,079
of those individuals if you then include

764
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,230
the dormancy information as slope and

765
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,089
y-intercept so here's the what slope and

766
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,319
y-intercept means

767
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:31,178
lure and slope means you will react

768
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,189
stronger to the chilling blue and the

769
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,879
y-intercept means you have a higher end

770
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,558
of dormancy

771
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,058
you can see there seems to be a possible

772
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:39,308
association between the southern having

773
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:40,868
higher ended endodermis e and a higher

774
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:42,940
response and chilling and the north

775
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:47,378
there's more red so you tend to be have

776
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,730
lower end o dormancy and so there's

777
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:50,858
several potential varieties if you look

778
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,778
across these traits that might be good

779
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:55,298
for breeding so we'd want red in the

780
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:57,128
slope blue in the y-intercept and then

781
00:28:55,298 --> 00:29:01,358
also Hardy in the LTE and so I've

782
00:28:57,128 --> 00:29:03,538
highlighted a few of them here and you

783
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:08,648
can see this is from Missouri Illinois

784
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:10,898
Iowa Kansas Montana and Ontario you can

785
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:12,548
see that you have the option to breed

786
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:15,398
with far more material if you consider

787
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:19,239
southern ripe area in a grapevine

788
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,189
breeding program okay

789
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,480
so now we're gonna do a quick shift up

790
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,580
so this is the phenotyping effort that

791
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,778
I've been leading in Geneva trying to

792
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,220
figure out these traits trying to figure

793
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:29,200
out how much of it we can use in

794
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,579
Grapevine breeding there's only so much

795
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,528
you can do in the field because as I

796
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:34,358
showed you every winter changes and it

797
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:36,819
gets very frustrating to try to run a

798
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:39,428
controlled experiment when the outside

799
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:40,898
keeps changing on you so what we do is

800
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:44,169
we take the field research to the lab

801
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:46,089
and we can take hints from the field

802
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:48,759
research so we know that all the species

803
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:49,778
reacted the same to chilling increasing

804
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,710
both our bud burst rate and their

805
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:53,329
synchronicity

806
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,740
the end of dormancy and LTE trade seem

807
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:56,599
to be a little bit tied to one another

808
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,789
but maybe that's only by chance and

809
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,230
there's variation within ripe area

810
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,289
suggesting that endo dormancy may be

811
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,690
adaptive and LTE may be a species static

812
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:07,039
trait so then I would want to know can

813
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,860
we determine the mechanism behind these

814
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,879
traits and so this is I'm gonna

815
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:15,979
introduce my student al Kowalewski we is

816
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,610
working with me and we're working on

817
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,930
trying to dissect D acclamation so we

818
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,879
want to look for the correlation of D

819
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:26,509
acclamation phenotype and budburst

820
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,370
phenotype so what we did is we took by

821
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:30,230
de samme rensis by de stripe area those

822
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:33,289
are those Clarke cold hardy wild species

823
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,640
and Vitis vinifera and we subjected them

824
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,980
to a test and so here are some of the

825
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,980
stats on the species amiran sis and ripe

826
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,110
area are fast FD kilometers limited

827
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,049
chilling hours and fast bud bursting

828
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:47,329
species in vinifera we have slower d

829
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,859
acclamation slower bud burst and if you

830
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,879
look at Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon

831
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:51,439
you'll see that there's a pretty big

832
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,170
difference there in the chilling hours

833
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,110
so we can compare the normal bud burst

834
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,250
rate with a delayed bud burst rate and

835
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,119
what we do is we take a whole bunch of

836
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,279
canes from the field

837
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,289
put them into growing conditions where

838
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,589
everything is controlled and sampled the

839
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:07,970
material for Bud hardiness check it for

840
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:11,299
bud burst phenology and then look at

841
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,640
gene expression so here's an example of

842
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:16,519
what the experiment looks like on day 10

843
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,990
if you can see hopefully you can see

844
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,829
that you can see a Muir ences has greens

845
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,289
full and bud

846
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:23,240
buds so I mentioned it's the fastest bud

847
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:25,250
breaker if you look at ripe area

848
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,380
Riesling our cap saw and you can find

849
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,640
the buds they're not breaking bud so

850
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,100
there's just an example of what our data

851
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,630
looks like as we're taking it we have

852
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,919
several hypotheses associated with the

853
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,110
gene expression when it comes to the

854
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,870
processes of D acclimation bud burst and

855
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:40,399
cold hardiness so based on the field

856
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:42,889
data we would think that the acclimation

857
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,780
genes would be on in all genotypes but

858
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,960
would be tied to the actual rate of D

859
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:49,879
acclimation for each species bud burst

860
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,920
genes should be all up regulated and

861
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,410
also tied to the rate of bud burst for

862
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,880
each species and that genes are that are

863
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,110
important for cold hardiness and cold

864
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,030
survival should be massively down

865
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:01,278
regulated because there is no longer a

866
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:03,418
stress

867
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,769
so what we did is we did hunt we

868
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,720
collected hundreds of cuttings on

869
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:10,019
February 2nd and here's the chilling

870
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,749
hours at in the field at on February 7th

871
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:15,028
it's about 750 hours and what that means

872
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:17,569
is that my rents this riparian Riesling

873
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:20,720
are all fully chilled caps top is not

874
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:23,038
here's their their field D acclamation

875
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,589
response this is from LT so we know that

876
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,690
riparian amaranthus are fast reasoning

877
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:29,638
in cab stop are slow and they're

878
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,288
budburst phenology in this experiment

879
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:33,569
reflected their chilling hours so we had

880
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:36,298
a Muir ences first ripe area second

881
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:37,710
Riesling third and Cabernet started

882
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:39,210
bursting about the same time as Riesling

883
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,098
but I was really stretched out because

884
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:45,749
it was not fully chilled so not

885
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:49,439
synchronized this data is showing you

886
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:52,348
the D acclamation rate 22 degrees for

887
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,210
ripe area and a Muir Ensis so these data

888
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:58,618
points are the cold hardiness levels

889
00:32:54,210 --> 00:33:00,659
measured by LTE each day and then here

890
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:02,249
and these dashed lines is the

891
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,200
temperature of some control canes we

892
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:05,970
left in the cold room at 4:00 so treat

893
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,149
is exactly the same but kept at 4

894
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,829
degrees instead of 22 if we look at

895
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:15,388
cultivated grape here's the D

896
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:16,558
acclamation rates at 22 C and at 4 C the

897
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:17,969
first thing you'll notice is that the

898
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,819
rate of D acclamation of eco dormant

899
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,108
buds is exactly the same the slope is

900
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,788
not different amongst these four

901
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:26,009
varieties so this is totally in contrast

902
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:27,569
to what we see in the field what we

903
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,819
think is this happened because we put

904
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:31,319
them into 22 degrees Celsius 24 hours a

905
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,210
day which is not a realistic situation

906
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,558
this is the problem with going from the

907
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,419
field to the lab sometimes you can

908
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,638
overshoot so we basically put them in a

909
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,288
maximum growth rate

910
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:43,589
condition and they all D acclimated the

911
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:45,388
same however at 4 degrees C you see that

912
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:47,069
only a mere Ensis was deactivating at a

913
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:49,348
different rate so this means that that

914
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,700
species has is able to respond to much

915
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:52,470
cooler temperatures and this would make

916
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,090
sense from a field point of view because

917
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,038
it D acclimates the fastest in the field

918
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:58,439
as well and you spend much more time at

919
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,210
4 than you do at 22 so in this

920
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,680
experiment we've decoupled D acclimation

921
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,210
in budburst

922
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,769
so we can't look at gene expression

923
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,390
patterns in the same way that we were

924
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:09,418
planning but we can still look at what

925
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,820
was going on so here are day 0 through

926
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,139
d8 this is the D acclamation rate these

927
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,409
are the days that we sampled for RNA

928
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,389
seek genes that have shared expression

929
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,340
that are important for D acclimation are

930
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,389
going to be about the same for all four

931
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,090
varieties because they're all d

932
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:25,918
acclimating at the same rate genes that

933
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,300
have a staggered expression pattern are

934
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,619
going to be tied to budburst because

935
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,580
they're bud bursting at different rates

936
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:36,119
and genes that go down are related to

937
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:38,009
cold hard ass these are assumptions so

938
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,779
what we did is we collected material on

939
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,030
each of these days for the entire

940
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,679
experiment round them up and did

941
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,600
extractions for RNA and then sequence

942
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,000
that RNA and i'm not sure how many

943
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,769
people are done RNA seekin here but

944
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,648
basically we sequenced over almost 1

945
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:58,079
billion RNA sequencing reads it was an

946
00:34:55,648 --> 00:35:01,409
enormous data set after we cleaned it up

947
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,139
we have about 500,000 reads in this

948
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:05,609
experiment if you take those 500,000

949
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,809
reads and align them to the genome and

950
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,059
try to figure out which genes are turned

951
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:11,730
on which genes are turned off we out of

952
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:15,509
the 32,000 predicted cultivated grape

953
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:18,240
genes we picked up about 13 to 16,000 so

954
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,490
you go from almost a billion points of

955
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,219
data to hopefully just 13 to 16 thousand

956
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,839
which is still a massive data set if you

957
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,579
then apply some statistics and look at

958
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,800
significantly differentially expressed

959
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,829
genes we can cut that data set way down

960
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,860
to the max 4,000 genes invited Samuel

961
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:39,150
rinses are on or off in this experiment

962
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,500
and in right area just under 2,000 so

963
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,690
it's still a massive data set to deal

964
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,869
with but this is how we're going about

965
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:48,720
looking at it if you're unfamiliar with

966
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:50,969
micro chip analysis or rna-seq analysis

967
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:55,769
this is what a heat map of RNA seek data

968
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:58,469
looks like blue to red indicates down to

969
00:35:55,769 --> 00:36:01,039
up gene regulation so blue genes are

970
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:03,659
down regulated red genes are upregulated

971
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,759
and what you can see here in this

972
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,589
cluster and this cluster is that the

973
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,990
genes start out down regulated and

974
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,579
gradually increase in gene expression

975
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:13,739
and the difference between these two is

976
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,480
this one I guess you could say it's

977
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,709
gradually up regulated whereas this is

978
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,039
early up regulated you see the

979
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:22,590
transition from blue to red is faster in

980
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,809
this box and this box are down regulated

981
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:28,019
genes so they start high and they end

982
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:30,659
low and then in this little box here you

983
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,829
can see they start blue go red go back

984
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:34,589
to blue so these are genes that are

985
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:37,650
coming on probably starting a signal

986
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:40,680
cascade and then being shut off so those

987
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,210
are peaking genes so again these are our

988
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,609
gene numbers we have this is a Muir and

989
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,769
since I'm showing you so this is the

990
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:49,890
3923 genes each line isn't in is a gene

991
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:52,500
if we look at up regulated genes that

992
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:53,219
are found in all four of our different

993
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,880
genotypes

994
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:59,129
there's only 447 genes so this is this

995
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,720
is much more manageable than even 3,000

996
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,730
genes if we look at genes that are

997
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,459
shared in the down-regulation category

998
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,199
there's roughly 230 across all four

999
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,019
varieties so now we can look at these

1000
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,519
genes and see what sort of differences

1001
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:15,000
in gene expression are going on in all

1002
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:18,480
of these processes so I picked some just

1003
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,679
at random this this is not I didn't

1004
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,030
choose this because there's a tada

1005
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,440
moment coming or anything like that I

1006
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,670
just wanted to show you some of the gene

1007
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,470
expression patterns and some of the

1008
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,780
processes that were identifying or that

1009
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:29,579
are related to in this case D

1010
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,350
acclimation so as I mentioned D

1011
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,759
acclimation occurred equally among all

1012
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,130
four varieties so we'd expect you an

1013
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,210
expression to be more or less all up for

1014
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,559
everybody and you can see some of that

1015
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:42,449
here gibberellin 3 beta hydroxylase ox 1

1016
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,960
these are things were related to

1017
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:47,279
hormones

1018
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,900
JoEllen and oxen ABC transporters lipid

1019
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,180
transporter proteins if I'm not sure if

1020
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,170
you can see the y-axis here but it goes

1021
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:56,909
from something like 2000 to around

1022
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,570
18,000 expression units so massively up

1023
00:37:56,909 --> 00:38:02,608
regulated lipid transfer proteins

1024
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,890
histone deacetylase is important for

1025
00:38:02,608 --> 00:38:08,279
actually shutting genes off it ties up

1026
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:09,509
the DNA into histones and so this is

1027
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,390
interesting that they're up regulated

1028
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,920
and then cue pin here which is Cubans

1029
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:16,170
have been seen to play a role in

1030
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,800
germination and wheat so a lot of this

1031
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,690
makes sense

1032
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,180
in Inadi acclimation process and then

1033
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,769
process

1034
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:23,019
it's the butt is getting ready for

1035
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:26,679
growth and a picture over here is some a

1036
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:28,869
summary gibberellins auxins lipids like

1037
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,608
we said I'm sorry the colors of the

1038
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,460
lines here are indicated by the

1039
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:35,348
genotypes in the same color but if you

1040
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,780
want an easy easy key

1041
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:41,650
blue and green or wild orange and purple

1042
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:44,319
are cultivated so genes involved in

1043
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,180
budburst we would hypotheses hypothesize

1044
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:48,039
that these would be turned on fastest in

1045
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,449
Douma rensis because it bursts fastest

1046
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,130
followed by ripe area and then the

1047
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:52,629
vanilla is and you can kind of see from

1048
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,700
this that we were actually need to

1049
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,869
extend our experiment beyond day because

1050
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,058
we're not picking up a lot of that

1051
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:00,730
cultivated response but here are six

1052
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:01,839
genes that are upregulated rapidly and

1053
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,380
we think would be playing a role as

1054
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,880
budburst at ESO one is a floral organ

1055
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,500
differentiating gene so this makes sense

1056
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,170
the floral meristem is probably becoming

1057
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:14,530
activated GSA forwards has a role in

1058
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,849
gibberellin ethylene has a role alpha

1059
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,010
tubulin and alpha extension these are

1060
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:20,318
both expansion and an elongation type

1061
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:23,440
genes and oxygen response factors so a

1062
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:25,179
lot of growth things we look at down

1063
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,740
regulated genes here's another sample of

1064
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:31,328
just six this Plex string e or pH domain

1065
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,618
protein that's the only information we

1066
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:35,200
have on it but it goes from something

1067
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:37,108
like 14,000 down to 2,000 so massively

1068
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,868
down regulated this has a role in

1069
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:42,848
membrane transports SRC 2 it's been

1070
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:44,980
picked up in soybeans in response to

1071
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:47,530
cold work regulation so this makes sense

1072
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,298
another good candidate DREV genes and

1073
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,880
were key genes are both transcription

1074
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:54,400
factors that play a role in cold

1075
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,720
hardiness dehydration stress even some

1076
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,019
of the other stresses depending on the

1077
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:02,828
family member Galactic Galacta null

1078
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:05,048
synthase is plays a role in getting rid

1079
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,609
of raffinose and raffinose is a sugar

1080
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:08,170
that's been seen to be up regulated in

1081
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:11,529
response to cold so this makes a lot of

1082
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,510
sense it's being shut off as with any

1083
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,190
gene expression study you get a whole

1084
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,020
bunch of genes that have no function

1085
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,280
attached to them unknown proteins or no

1086
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:21,159
hit proteins and some of them have

1087
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,540
really cool gene expression patterns so

1088
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,429
here on the top are two that are down

1089
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:25,989
regulated quite a bit two in the bottom

1090
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:27,909
are up regulated so these are genes that

1091
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:29,558
we we don't know what they do but they

1092
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,369
they clearly play a role in this process

1093
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,490
they're picked up and

1094
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:34,929
all of our samples and then there's a

1095
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:36,879
whole category stuff that just has weird

1096
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:38,799
gene expression patterns and we can't

1097
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,480
make a lot of sense of so there you have

1098
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,430
to take it all with a little bit of salt

1099
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,570
I've shown you a little bit out of that

1100
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:48,190
450 and 230 but what we're doing is

1101
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,140
trying to figure out candidate genes and

1102
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,059
pathways that play a role in these

1103
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:54,369
processes and so that's the ultimate

1104
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:56,079
goal can we identify pathways that are

1105
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,849
over represented within this data set so

1106
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,880
we could then say the D acclimation

1107
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:02,650
pathway is this and this is what you get

1108
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,300
to work with if you're looking for doing

1109
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,470
pathway analysis and which is why I'm

1110
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,019
not going to show you today because I

1111
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:11,289
can't do this but this is the metabolic

1112
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:13,539
pathway and great for everything it's

1113
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:17,349
not just cold response or anything so

1114
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:18,730
instead I did one pathway I zeroed in on

1115
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,659
because a lot of the candidate genes I

1116
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,449
saw in the dataset

1117
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:24,789
we're picking up in my memory about

1118
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,839
flavonoid biosynthesis when I was a grad

1119
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:27,820
student ID to do my preliminary

1120
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,430
examination I had to write a grant on

1121
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,870
flavonoid biosynthesis so I finally paid

1122
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:34,329
off

1123
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:36,099
and so I I saw that there's lots of

1124
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:38,349
these genes I recognized and so I

1125
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:40,360
thought I'd reek remake the pathway just

1126
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:41,829
to see what was going on and so here's

1127
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,960
the pathway that leads from

1128
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:45,789
phenylalanine to flavonoids or to Mono

1129
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,250
Lake Knowles and they all go through

1130
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:49,509
this sort of intermediate which is

1131
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,739
really important so if you go to the

1132
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,060
left of this you turn into a flavonoid

1133
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:55,509
if you go to the right you turn into a

1134
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:57,070
lignin these are the genes and it's

1135
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:00,100
really not important that you know what

1136
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:02,350
their names are but maybe you know

1137
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:04,210
chalcone synthase I think that plays a

1138
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,889
lot of role and flower color and that

1139
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,409
kind of stuff and so this pathway would

1140
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:09,969
lead to color and Epis islands this is

1141
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:11,079
peroxidase just in case you're

1142
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,959
interested so basically we have

1143
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,099
flavonoids or mono lignins

1144
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,139
these are the genes in that pathway I

1145
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,880
picked up almost every single gene

1146
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:21,400
differentially expressed in all four

1147
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,530
genotypes in this pathway but you can

1148
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,480
see that it's not always the same so

1149
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,460
shared expression down shared expression

1150
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,769
down am your incest and ripe area are

1151
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,619
starting to pick up pretty much shared

1152
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:34,269
expression across the lignans but when

1153
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:35,980
you get to the flavonoids em your

1154
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:37,269
ancestors way up and right Perrier's ray

1155
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,219
up so this suggests that maybe in

1156
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:41,349
riparian Amir insists the flavonoid

1157
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:42,969
pathway is playing a bigger role in

1158
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:44,829
those buds ready for budburst orgy

1159
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:46,088
acclimation something even though you

1160
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:48,759
see all the genes are up here the

1161
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:51,159
expression level of this isoform is much

1162
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:52,869
lower than this one so it just gives us

1163
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:54,909
an idea of what might be going on and so

1164
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:57,278
here's that whole pathway pink is down

1165
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:59,440
regulated green is up regulated and dark

1166
00:42:57,278 --> 00:43:01,599
green is massively up regulated so you

1167
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,338
can kind of get an idea of maybe some of

1168
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,859
the pathway that's playing a role in

1169
00:43:03,338 --> 00:43:07,778
this and my hope would be to take all of

1170
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:09,969
the genes not just a few that I showed

1171
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:12,429
you but apply that to some pathway

1172
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:14,199
analysis and then determine if there are

1173
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,699
other aspects of the metabolism that are

1174
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:17,919
unique to different species are unique

1175
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:22,389
to perhaps the difference between cab

1176
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,608
solve and Riesling so again you sort of

1177
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:28,058
like a buzz through physiology and

1178
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:29,889
phenotyping and next-gen analysis and we

1179
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:33,930
have got a lot of future plans with this

1180
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:36,068
sort of research we want to look at more

1181
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:38,048
controlled freezing experiments where we

1182
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:40,058
take all the Canes into the into the

1183
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:41,889
cooler in the beginning of the season

1184
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:43,690
and subject them to freezing and warming

1185
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:45,400
in a controlled manner so we can sort of

1186
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:49,119
see their response to temperature better

1187
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,818
we want to look at both endo dormant and

1188
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,369
eco dormant D acclimation what what we

1189
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:56,858
looked at today with eco dormant we also

1190
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,450
want to do some diurnal sampling so and

1191
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:59,920
Al's not particularly happy with this

1192
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:01,689
but we're gonna go out in the field

1193
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,430
we're gonna be sampling like every four

1194
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,229
hours over several days to try to get

1195
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:07,058
how the genes are being turned on and

1196
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:09,189
off as that they warm up during the day

1197
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:11,019
and then cold at night try to get a

1198
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,999
better handle on how much gene

1199
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:14,998
expression actually occurs near zero

1200
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:18,459
ultimately we'd like to move this to

1201
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:19,869
Association transcriptomics and look

1202
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,778
within mapping populations to try to

1203
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:26,108
find eqtl associated with dormancy

1204
00:44:22,778 --> 00:44:27,728
associated with the acclimation and one

1205
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:29,528
area that's massively under studied is

1206
00:44:27,728 --> 00:44:31,028
cold hardiness in trunks and canes

1207
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:32,199
that's something we haven't touched it

1208
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:33,940
all here and it's not something that

1209
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,379
I've done much work in but ultimately

1210
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,979
we'd like to move into that area to try

1211
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:40,390
to get whole vine responds so with that

1212
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:42,338
I would just say thank you to the people

1213
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,409
at USDA who support this work my

1214
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:46,210
technician is Kathleen Dee's and a

skee he's been helping out a ton and is

1220
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,920
going to be helping out a lot more

1221
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,170
Bruce rice is his co advisor and Tim

1222

Martinson and his team bill will Z Steve

1223
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,849
loose Beth Takas and Lynn Johnson is

1224
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,530
with the Cornell statistics group she

1225
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:11,480
helps me out a lot and then I've got

1226
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,820
some other collaborators on here oh you

1227
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,670
can't even see that things in the way

1228
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,800
and Fennell Dan wood Mitch Michaela

1229
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,210
centenary and grant Cramer these people

1230
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,710
all play a role in these same sorts of

1231
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:25,429
phenotypes and so we all kind of work

1232
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,960
together and I will just ask if there's

1233
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:30,279
any questions I'd do my best to answer

1234
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,280
them Thanks
