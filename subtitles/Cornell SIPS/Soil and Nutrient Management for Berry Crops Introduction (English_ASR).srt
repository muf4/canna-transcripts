Berry soil and nutrient management

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,840
webinars which are sponsored by the

6
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,198

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,039
education program um s and they're

8
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,119

00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,959
who is going to be the speaker I'm just

15
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,279
helping her out um I think we can start

16
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,319
now with the webinar I'm going to give

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,680
you a brief little tour in case you

18
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,039
haven't uh joined us for an Adobe

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,880
Connect webinar there are a couple of

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,320
features that may be slightly different

21
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,599
than other webinars that you've attended

22
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:39,078
um in the the lower left corner is the

23
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,919
links um you can actually link directly

24
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:47,879
to these different uh websites from this

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,759
uh webinar page um we are recording this

26
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,078
entire classroom so if you have

27
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,280
questions or the introduction that

28
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:58,478
you're giving of yourself here in the

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,960
chat box those will be recorded uh for

30
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:05,478
future viewing for other people and uh

31
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,399
certainly you can talk to one another um

32
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,280
if you have a private comment that is

33
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,318
not perent perhaps to the webinar you

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,598
can actually make that comment um by

35
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,280
going over to the top right of the chat

36
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,719
box and kind of Select people to chat

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,439
with probably most of your um chats will

38
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,239
be pertinent though and we do hope that

39
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,479
you write your comments and questions

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,000
into the chat box so they'll be recorded

41
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,799
and that's right down here that long bar

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,519
underneath is where you type into and

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,920
then hit the little um balloon icon and

44
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,640
that sends it there are some files the

45
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:44,199
lower right hand corner of the digital

46
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,119
classroom there are some files that you

47
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,000
can download to your own computer and

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,640
you're invited to do that at any point

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,840
here in the um beginning of the class

50
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,598
and then the notes the agenda and other

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,158
thing are in this um bar on the the pod

52
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:05,158
that's on the right hand side side of

53
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:06,759
the screen um I think uh Kathy I'm

54
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,560
hoping that you might be able to help me

55
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,000
or give me an idea would you like to do

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
the pre-test polls

57
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,598
now

58
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:27,959
um I think is that a yes I'm sorry

59
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,039
um I think Kathy that you would like me

60
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,039
to pull these P the pods on is that

61
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,399
correct all right I think I'm going to

62
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,438
go ahead and we've got some um poll

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,438
questions for people

64
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,438
to um

65
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:08,560
View and uh you can go ahead and answer

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,400
this everyone should everyone who's

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,400
logged on should

68
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,680
answer to the best of your knowledge and

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,519
if you don't this is not like an SAT

70
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,680
where you make your best guess if you

71
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,800
really don't know then please just say

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,680
don't know um in all of the questions

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,680
that would be really helpful

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
and

75
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,799
yeah Hillary you had a question about

76
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:13,439
how to submit your answer you just go

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,240
ahead and click it and it will

78
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,240
automatically

79
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:26,000
submit we had over 60 people um sign on

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,519
for this we've got quite a large group

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,519
and I think we still have a few more

82
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,959
people um that need to vote and I'm

83
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,560
encouraging you to do that because this

84
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,560
is part of the beginning kind of the

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,519
threshold um knowledge level that we'll

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,120
be keeping track of as we go forward for

87
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,120
the for the

88
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,879
grant um yes we are still on question

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,279
one Lee and I guess most people can have

90
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,839
voted so I'm going to close this is that

91
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,839
all right Kathy

92
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,560
all right I'm going to go ahead and

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,519
close this one and then we'll um go to

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,519
the second pole

95
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,000
pod changes in soil PH by add sulfur or

96
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:37,519
lime generally take effect and then just

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,519
choose and if you don't know um please

98
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,038
again yes I will make the Pod wider

99
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,639
and I think we've got most everybody has

100
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,799
voted so we'll close that pod now and

101
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,800
open the second one um thank you very

102
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,199
much folks for bearing with us but we do

103
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,400
need to do these um polls as part of the

104
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,160
kind of testing your knowledge

105
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,439
here the best form of nitrogen to apply

106
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,439
to blueberries

107
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:48,279
is and again if you don't know please um

108
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,279
admit that and don't guess

109
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,199
right I think we have about everybody

110
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,039
there you have a fair amount of

111
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,399
questions so bear with

112
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:19,158
me um raspberries often display nutrient

113
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:24,799
deficiency or excess symptoms in the

114
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,800
field true false don't know

115
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,680
all right thank you

116
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,440
folks we're on number five yep um

117
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:07,120
strawberries should be fertilized in

118
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,120
Spring before Berry set

119
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:37,480
all right I think most people have um

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,959
answered question five we'll move on to

121
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,959
question

122
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:50,639
six Optimum soil organic matter content

123
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,519
for Berry crops is less than 3% greater

124
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,199
than 3% soil organic matter is not a

125
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:01,320
critical factor in Berry Crop

126
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,320
Production don't know or know

127
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,199
vote all

128
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,839
right okay very good thank you very

129

much uh let's let go on

130
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,759
to number question number

131
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:45,278
seven the best soil for strawberry

132
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,278
production is a well- drained Sandy Lam

133
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,120
all right excellent oh wait a minute I

134
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,600
think we still got it here let me try to

135
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,600
close

136
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,919
that all right this is question number

137
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,240
eight soil tests attempt to estimate the

138
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,399
amount of plant available nutrients in

139
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,639
the soil not the total amount of

140
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,078
nutrients in the soil is this true or

141
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,079
false or if you don't know just let us

142
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,958
know all right I think that's

143
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,839
everyone sorry this is a little

144
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,159
cumbersome when I'm opening these

145
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,320
Clays and soils high in organic matter

146
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,480
have higher nutrient holding capacity

147
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,800
while Sands have a lower nutrient

148
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,800
holding capacity true or

149
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,559
false okay I think we have everybody

150
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,559
there

151
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,559
oops I think I opened the wrong one

152
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,559
sorry getting a

153
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,399
little nutrient levels in Berry plant

154
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,399
tissue will always mirror nutrient

155
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,120
levels found in soil true or

156
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,198
false again thanks for bearing with us

157
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,078
folks um this is just something that we

158
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:03,399
need to do in order to get a pre-test

159
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:09,359
level of all of your

160
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,360
um all of your levels of information so

161
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:19,319
thanks all right I think we've got

162
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,319
everybody

163
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,159
there all right this is question 11 the

164
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,838
recommended pH for ramble plantings

165
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,319
raspberries and blackberries is and just

166
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,320
choose

167
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,198

a little bit later don't guess if you

169
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,559
don't know just put don't

170
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,199
know all right thank you very much

171
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,199
we're getting

172
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,278
there it is rare for a single single fol

173
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
or nutrient to be deficient in Berry

174
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,000
crops often multiple deficiencies occur

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
simultaneously

176
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,479
all right I think we've got everybody's

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
vote

178
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:47,559
there best time to collect Berry leaves

179
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,559
for folar analysis is

180
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,919
all right I think we have

181
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,000
everybody and that was 13 right so now

182
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,000
we're on

183
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,440
14 soil tests provide accurate results

184
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,839
for all essential mineral nutrients

185
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,839
while folar analysis does not true or

186
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,839
false

187
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,399
all right thank you

188
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:56,599
folks and I think we're on question 15

189
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,439
boy Kathy I hope you're keeping track of

190
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,079
me because I'm losing track of which

191
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,519
question we're on Visual Diagnosis of

192
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:07,120
berry crop nutrient problems is accurate

193
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
and precise true or

194
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:27,000
false all right very good and that was

195
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:30,239
15 we are getting very close

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,120
folks the recommended pH levels for

197
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:40,120
strawberry is 4.2 to 4.5 5.5 to 6.0 60

198
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,759
to 65 and 65 to 70 or don't know that's

199
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,759
a perfectly legitimate

200
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,360
answer right I think we have everyone

201
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,360
there we'll go on to question 17

202
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,879
question 17 a combination of soil

203
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,120
testing tissue analysis and observation

204
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,720
of crop respon is the best approach to

205
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:15,198
assessing Berry crop nutrient status

206
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,199
true false or don't

207
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:30,399
know okay

208
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,399
excellent going to move to question 18

209
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:39,558
soil Health may be improved by frequent

210
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,558
cultivation to improve soil

211
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,519
drainage true or false or don't

212
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,440
know all right thanks thank you all for

213
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:06,158
voting

214
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,080
um I think we have two more pods left

215
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,080
two more pole

216
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:17,599
pods question 19 characteristics of a

217
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,000
healthy soil include good soil tilth

218
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,719
sufficient depth an excessive supply of

219
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,679
nutrients a small population of

220
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,759
microorganisms or don't know and you can

221
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,759
check all that apply all that are

222
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,759
correct

223
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,759
this will be trickier for me to see if

224
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,038
everyone has voted because we've got

225
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,240
multiple answers but when they stop

226
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:49,359
ticking up that's when we'll close this

227
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,359
and we'll go to the last

228
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:00,319
poll all right thank you and for the

229
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,759
last

230
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,319
pre-test

231
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,000
question soil and leaf samples for

232
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,639
testing should be collected in a

233
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,400
v-shaped sampling pattern across the

234
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,400
entire

235
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,120
planting just say true false or don't

236
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,119
know

237
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,960
all right I think everyone has voted I

238
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,880
thank you for um hanging in there with

239
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,200
us for the that

240
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,600
pre-test um group of questions um I do

241
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,798
want to point out one way that you can

242
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,918
you can always uh try to get our

243
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,158
attention through the chat box or you

244
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,960
can um on the top bar there's a little

245
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,240
icon with a hand up you can raise your

246
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,960
hand and we'll try to um make sure that

247
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,919
we address whatever your question

248
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,200
is um I think I'm going to move us now

249
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,280
into

250
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,200
the next segment um which is the

251
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,839
presentation segment and introduce Kathy

252
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:25,200
heidenrich to you if I can remember how

253
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,199

the Cornell

257
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:42,240
University uh Barry extension support

258
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,480
specialist um she was my partner in

259
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,120
crime when we were doing a a New York

260
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,919
Farm viability Barry project and um

261
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,599
she's a really great person very

262
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,880
dedicated to Barry education and she is

263
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,279
standing in for Dr Marvin pritz who is

264
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,520
currently flying back from the asss

265
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,639
meetings in

266
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,599
Hawaii um and Kathy will probably be the

267
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,480
moderator for many of the webinars

268
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,199
upcoming but she's going to take over

269
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,759
the introductory part and uh

270
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,798
Kathy

271
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:19,000
Laura yes oh I'm I'm really happy

272
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,319
technology is great when it works but

273
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,240
all during the quiz my audio was not

274
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,240
working so I'm sorry I couldn't help out

275
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,480
that's okay and I think everybody

276
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,519
hopefully everybody will be able to hear

277
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,319
you I can hear you just perfectly great

278
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,359
well thank you everyone for coming today

279
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,639
I'm very excited about this project um

280
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,599
this actually is one of the first

281
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,000
successful gr proposals that I've

282
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:47,678
written and I'm really really happy with

283
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,880
the response we have 66 people

284
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,360
registered already if you have other

285
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,278
colleagues who would be interested in

286
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,879
participating it's not too late for them

287
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:59,400
they're more than welcome to attend if

288
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,559
you missed the pre test or if you

289
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,480
haven't filled out the registration form

290
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,359
um when we get to the end you'll be able

291
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,240
to download those in the

292
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:13,038
uh last screen and please feel free to

293
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,640
email those to me so today I just want

294
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:19,558
to give you an overview of the project

295
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,038
and um we're going to start I think with

296
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,480
the title soil management and Berry

297
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,960
crops as a model for management

298
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,880
education so our Hope was while

299
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,038
providing information on Berry crop in

300
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,000
terms of soil and nutrient management

301
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,519
that the information that you'll learn

302
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,558
and the resources that will become

303
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:41,519
available to you will also be applicable

304
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,240
ac across a wide variety of crops and so

305
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,200
we're very excited about this and very

306
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,200
happy that you've joined

307
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:52,960
us so we're just going to take a quick

308
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,240
look at the project itself there were

309
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,120
several issues that we identified in the

310
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,839
course of the work that I've done for Dr

311
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,839
Marin pritz at Cornell and one of them

312
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,399
is that commercial Berry growers in the

313
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:08,079
Northeast traditionally have applied

314
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,240
fertilizer uh based on crop age so you

315
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,639
know if the crops are less than a year

316
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,159
old no application in that particular

317
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,159
year if they're one-year-old or 2 years

318
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:21,159
old um a certain uh poundage of

319
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,840
fertilizer is applied and

320
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,320
then as they increase in age that number

321
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,199
probably goes up so this practice is

322
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,639
still very popular today

323
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,319
uh some 10 years or more after

324
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,120
commercial Berry crop guidelines have

325
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,558
shifted to an analysis-based

326
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,879
fertilization program and the testing

327
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,678
has become very good and widely

328
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,480
available at very reasonable cost and

329
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,038
then the other issue is that um because

330
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,319
Berry crops are by Nature a perennial

331
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:55,119
crop system adoption of soil Health

332
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,119
improving practices as also been

333
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,440
slow so on the egg educator multiplier

334
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,480
end of it on your end of it we

335
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,558
discovered that although you're

336
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,960
frequently called on to cover multiple

337
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,759
Commodities or information areas they

338
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,798
often fall outside of your field of

339
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,960
expertise and so it's a struggle to

340
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,798
assist commercial Berry Growers with

341
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,960
their soil nutrient problems and there

342
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,000
is no single comprehensive resource for

343
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,480
this topic that's available either for

344
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,480
you as Educators or for

345
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,399
Growers so this is an issue that Dr

346
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,159
pritz and I discuss quite frequently and

347
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,239
decided we wanted to try to address and

348
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,000
we want to thank Northeast s for funding

349
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,679
this project so it's a two-year project

350
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,278
and we're hoping to provide in-depth

351
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,840
Berry crop soil nutrient Management

352
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,480
training and resources for you and in

353
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,918
turn you can use these to assist

354
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,919
commercial

355
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,678
Growers so the first year of the plan

356
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,720
we're going to try to help you build

357
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:59,120
some expertise and the webinars series

358
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,120
is the first um

359
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,000
phase of that plan and we're also going

360
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,719
to have some case study learning modules

361
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,880
on the subject for

362
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,159
you in the meantime we're also

363
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,159
developing resources to be used by you

364
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,880
in grower training and so I'll be

365
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,120
sending out to you at some point in the

366
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,520
next week or two um the link to a beta

367
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,158
website that we would like you to look

368
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,119
at and use and review and we would like

369
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,000
your input on how we can make that the

370
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:27,479
best resource possible for the job at

371
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,038
hand and then in year two of the project

372
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,159
we're hoping that some of you will

373
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,038
develop and Implement grower training

374
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,600
and we're willing to assist you with

375
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,640
that and that you'll participate some

376
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,199
Growers to do soil and nutrient

377
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,880
testing and within the Northeast region

378
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,720
we do have funds available through the

379
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,120
grant for 50 Growers to receive

380
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,240
complimentary soil and nutrient testing

381
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,278
if you're outside the Northeast region

382
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,960
um there may be some other options and

383
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:57,038
I'm willing to discuss that with you so

384
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:01,000
we're hoping that two to three Growers

385
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,599
uh per training uh event will be

386
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,240
participating in testing and then

387
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:06,278
implementing at least on a portion of

388
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,519
their planting an analysis based

389
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:09,720
fertilization program and then we're

390
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,240
asking that you might carry out

391
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,600
one-on-one consultations with

392
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,480
participating Growers to discuss results

393
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,439
and we'd like to capture those results

394
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,679
and their feedback on it to use uh to

395
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,558
help convince other Growers hopefully to

396
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,919
do the

397
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,599
same so I just wanted to share a little

398
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,600
bit with you about the team members and

399

444
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,519
comparison

445
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:40,038
between um a calendar-based crop age um

484
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,639
include the demographics in terms of age

485
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,278
but I have to say that we all fall in

486
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,919
that um mid-career category so we need

487
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,960
to be recruiting some younger people to

488
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,960

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,880
Engineers um and and apart from the

503
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:14,000
professional expertise fields that I

504
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,000
listed on the demographic survey we have

505
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,638
people who are in Environmental

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,839

management and best management practices

511
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,480
so how are we going to measure the

512
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,558
success of the project we've already

513
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,798
taken one step toward that in the preest

514
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:40,079
that you all participated in and I thank

515
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:41,960
you for that and just to warn you

516
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,319
there'll be another test at the end to

517
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,440
measure the expertise that's been

518
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,000
gained and then throughout the project

519
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,558
and in subsequent years we're going to

520
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,480
monitor the adoption and success of

521
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,398
analys analysis based Berry crop

522
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
nutrient soil management by the

523
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,239
commercial Growers who participate in

524
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,240
the project

525
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,600
so our final goal then is to have 50

526
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:09,079
Educators participate in the training to

527
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,038
expand their expertise and of those that

528
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:15,240
15 will develop and deliver some sort of

529
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:17,319
an outreach program on the same to 150

530
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,038
Berry Growers who manage approximately

531
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,638
750 Acres of berry crops and then we're

532
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,398
hoping that 50 of those Growers will

533
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:26,719
participate in preliminary soil nutrient

534
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,239
Andor soil Health testing and then

535
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,960
receive one-on-one assistance with the

536
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,960
interpretation of the results and then

537
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Implement that on

538
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Farm okay are there any

539
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,158
questions um if there are no more

540
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,720
questions I think we can move into the

541
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:57,880
final just the kind of the uh exit and

542
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,360
make sure please to um notice that there

543
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,240
there are the the links that you might

544
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:08,079
be interested in checking out there are

545
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,960
all these intro files um and Kathy

546
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:13,839
apparently my little cursor was of uh

547
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,840
showing so people could actually see

548
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:21,119
what I was voting on so you'll see where

549
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:25,439
my um challenges lie in my responses

550
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:28,038
and um did you were there post poll

551
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,919
questions for this segment or is it at

552
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:35,839
the very end no Laura that's going to be

553
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:38,080
at the end excellent good um I do want

554
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,759
to make sure that everybody knows um

555
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,918
that next week a week from today at the

556
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:46,119
same time our our topic uh will be

557
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,960
introduction to soil management and

558
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,638
we'll be talking about soil types

559
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,798
accessing soil surveys physical

560
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:54,879
properties of soil Etc that webinar will

561
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,440
be led by Dr Harold

562
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,480
vaness

563
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:04,240

00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,358
soil and nutrient management webinar

574
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,398
archive if you click on that and then

575

what we are hoping maybe people will

586
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,039
start formulating in your head how you

587
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:03,680
can use this information to do Outreach

588
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,838
