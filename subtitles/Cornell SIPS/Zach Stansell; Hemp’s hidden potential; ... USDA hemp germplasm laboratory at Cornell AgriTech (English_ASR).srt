1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,839
University um so it's fantastic to be

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:17,679
back in this room um thank you all so

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,800
much for coming uh everyone can read so

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,518
that I don't need to read the title of

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,080
my talk but I'd love to just tell you

7
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,559
about a lot of different hemp work

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,559
that's happening in Geneva right

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,160
now all right so let me just begin with

10
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,799
a little little bit of intention here's

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,359
an overview um a little bit of

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:39,280
background about me and hemp in general

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,479
um I'd like to talk about the status of

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,679
the germ plasm collection in Geneva um

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:49,000
and then kind of three topics how do we

16
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,600
phenotype hemp what kind of data are we

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,840
collecting what do the range and

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,359
distribution of that data look

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,039
like our lab places a pretty big

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,359
emphasis on developing tools and methods

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,359
as we're a public Service Agency um what

22
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,320
are some of the long-term projects we

23
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,640
can push on that will provide a lot of

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:13,079
value to everyone else long term that's

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,960
really fun and exciting to me to be able

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,959
to do that and uh tell you about some of

27
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,280
that work and then finally uh genotyping

28
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,478
efforts on

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,478
him

30
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:29,599
so all about me um so 200 years ago I

31
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:34,399
mean in 2020 I was a graduate student I

32
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:36,519
did my a exam In This Very Room so I'm

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,239
you know dealing with a little bit of

34
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:43,438
trauma

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:47,280
um but uh I'll I'll get through it so um

36
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:51,959
I had such a wonderful opportunity

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,599
to learn from Thomas borkman and His

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,879
deep and wide knowledge and wisdom I we

39
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,519
had so much fun exploring the genetic

40
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:03,519
diversity of broccoli together um slide

41
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,078
in a hemp talk um this is some of the

42
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,879
work that we did some of the varieties

43
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,439
we looked at and the population

44
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,439
structures on the

45
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:14,800
side uh this had

46
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:18,959
the dubious distinction of going viral

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,400
on Reddit um so I I woke up with like

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,519
14,000 notifications on my phone one

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,360
time um since then I have become a

50
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,159
curator and a geneticist at the USDA

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,720
plant gen IC resources unit in

52
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,959
Geneva um I I love this work it's so

53
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,039
exciting and it feels like a

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,039
continuation of a lot of the work and

55
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,959
and knowledge that I gained here at

56
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,199
Cornell um and then there's so many

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,039
things to talk about today um I'm going

58
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,518
to do my best to cover them and I really

59
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,598
want to stress that nearly everything

60
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm going to discuss today is

61
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:00,238
collaborative um I'll do my best to give

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,200
everybody credit for the contribution

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,599
that they've made um and please know in

64
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,759
many cases I'm just supporting their

65
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:13,719
work so what is

66
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:18,759
hemp what what is hemp you know we like

67
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:21,560
to put a cheeky emphasis on is uh so you

68
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:24,239
know it's it's actually kind of a more

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,319
subtle question than might it might

70
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:33,039
immediately seem so there's a legal

71
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:38,079
definition of him so below .3% total

72
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:41,199
THC um I know it's always a great way to

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,719
engage people to put a biochemical

74
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,079
pathway slide on a presentation um and

75
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,799
I'm doing this because I like to torture

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,360
audiences but I think this is important

77
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,920
so

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,640
broadly we can talk about

79
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,280
this quote unquote B Locus with two Al

80
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,598
I'm going to overs simp

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:08,598
this a bit um but our two most famous

82
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:14,719
cannabinoids CBD and

83
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:19,039
THC um are decarbox from an acidic form

84
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:21,399
and those two acidic forms are uh

85
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
converted from a common molecule which

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:28,000
they compete for

87
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:31,000
cbga so here's some data where we've

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,959
looked at compared total THC versus

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,240
total THC and you find this pretty

90
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,120
dramatic

91
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,400
pattern um when you look at a lot of

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,519
diverse germ plasm so we talk about

93
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:49,519
these three chemotypes you can have the

94
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:53,079
BT BT alal which is THC dominant mostly

95
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:57,279
THC um you can have two copies of the

96
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:59,038
other Alo um and those are CBD dominant

97
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,519
and then you can be heterozygous for

98
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,918
both of those

99
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:07,359
and that has very profound implications

100
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:11,758
on the the types of cannabinoids that

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:15,680
you'll observe in a given individual and

102
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,560
here's kind of the the critical point is

103
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,800
that the legal threshold is set at 3%

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,079
total THC so note that all chemotypes

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,319
can run

106
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,519
hot below that line is hemp above that

107
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,479
line is

108
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,399
marijuana as far as you know our current

109
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,680
laws and regulations are

110
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:43,079
concerned all right disas so within hemp

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,120
you have distinct male individuals and

112
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,719
female

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,800
individuals uh individuals with pistolet

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,319
flowers and steaman e Flowers um except

115
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,199
when it's not so that's kind of the

116
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,759
Bonkers but exciting thing about hemp is

117
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:03,879
there always seems to be an exception so

118
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,598
we have these two pictures that I took

119
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,719
about a week ago um of two individuals

120
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:14,079
growing in a field trial on the left is

121
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,639
a female inflorescence with anthers

122
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,879
protruding out of

123
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:23,478
it and on the right is an individual

124
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,800
with both female and male

125
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:27,399
inflorescences what's going on here you

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,400
know that it's

127
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,959
a there there's a lot to be about this

128
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,079
and it's going to take many people

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:40,079
smarter than me to disentangle this

130
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:44,439
question uh hemp is wind pollinated so

131
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:49,000
many of the crops we curate in

132
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:51,719
Geneva uh are insect pollinated so think

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,800
about all these different vegetables and

134
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,199
that's a relatively straightforward

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,720
process to create pure seeds from those

136
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,759
lines you grow them transplant them into

137
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,479
a field put an insect exclusion cage

138
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,160
over the top introduce a pollinator

139
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,240
allow random mating to occur come back

140
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,479
and collect the

141
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,079
seeds um this is just not not possible

142
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,758
with hemp so hemp pollen is about 22

143
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:22,120
microns in diameter and depending on who

144
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,439
you ask it can travel 10 kilometers by

145
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,680
wind there's some debate about that but

146
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:32,680
the take-home message is we cannot trust

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,959
outdoor Regen generations of

148
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,400
given uh accessions of pemp so we have

149
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:44,038
to use green houses and growth Chambers

150
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:47,878
and expensive and harder

151
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:50,360
techniques um so hemp is considered a

152
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,879
short day where the length of the night

153
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,439
regulates the transition from vegetative

154
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,158
state to reproductive

155
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:03,519
State any guesses what the next thing is

156
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:07,560
um except when it's not right so there's

157
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:11,158
almost certainly more to the story right

158
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,478
uh there's kind of a some wonderful work

159
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,240
kind of mapping the genetic control of

160
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,918
that photo period

161
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,079
sensitivity um but that's not the

162
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,079
complete story there's temperature and

163
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,800
cultural conditions and stress that are

164
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,639
all cross talking in there to my

165
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,400
knowledge this has not been disentangled

166
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:35,200
there's also photo period in sensitive

167
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:37,598
varieties that just flower

168
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,200
immediately uh

169
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,080
multi-purpose so this is a wonderful

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:49,600
slide in the Cornell hemp handbook and

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,920
to my knowledge there's no crop that you

172
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,680
can produce more different kinds of

173
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,479
products from or it's one of the highest

174
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,439
so depending on the organs of the plant

175
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,759
you can make all kinds of things from

176
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,839
construction material to fibers

177
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:09,159
geotextiles you can use the the wood the

178
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,320
herd to make construction materials the

179
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:17,439
seeds can be very rich and abundant in

180
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,000
different fatty acids Omega-3s Etc that

181
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,959
can be used in industrial processes or

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,720
food and then you know flowers people

183
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:29,639
love this plant and it has medicinal and

184
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,639
recreational properties right so all of

185
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:36,278
these things are part of the biology and

186
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:40,240
part of how humans utilize this

187
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:43,480
plant this is not even a comprehensive

188
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,680
list this is another point that I I want

189
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:51,120
to kind of impress on everyone that um I

190
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:54,199
collected Latin long data from different

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,639
herbaria collections in naturalist

192
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:01,079
GBF um other collections over time and

193
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:04,159
plotted this data out and so cannabis

194
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:06,759
has a Cosmopolitan distribution it's

195
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,399
globally distributed

196
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,278
so um in these different environments

197
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,278
it's undergone artificial selection by

198
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,879
people that are making selections for

199
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:21,720
different

200
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,759
purposes and then in many places hemper

201
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,040
cannabis has become naturalized and it's

202
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,278
undergone natural selection in these

203
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,958
different environments so there's a

204
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:33,958
proliferation of genetic diversity in

205
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,319
this one single

206
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,799
species okay so what's the story with

207
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,399
the hemp germplasm collection so we're

208
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,958
part of the national plant germ plasm

209
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,879
system there's approximately 20 Gene

210
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,759
Banks across the country and we maintain

211
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,600
about 600,000 active accessions that a

212
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,200
breeder or researcher can request today

213
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,360
via an online P portal called Gren

214
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,839
global

215
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,639
in Geneva uh we maintain a lot of really

216
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,320
fantastic questions so we have the

217
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,519
largest apple collection in the world

218
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,760
outright full stop um we maintain cold

219
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:19,278
hearty grapes uh 13,000 unique vegetable

220
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,278
accessions across about 12 or 13 genre

221
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,958
depending on how you count it hemp was

222
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:30,240
added to this list and we really began

223
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:33,039
this work in 2020 in in full

224
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,839
hemp has been around in the previous

225
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,078
iteration of npgs the plant introduction

226
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,040
system um you know their had received

227
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:45,078
materials this is likely from The balov

228
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,559
Collection back in the day so the pi

229
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:51,919
numbers count up sequentially and

230
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:55,399
they're in the 600,000 now this is pi

231
00:11:51,919 --> 00:12:00,199
948 uh this collection is

232
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:03,039
lost and it's probably Priceless but

233
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,680
let's continue so what what are our

234
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,399
objectives here in

235
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,519
Geneva so first and foremost is to try

236
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,559
to do our best to capture all of this

237
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,879
genetic

238
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,879
diversity um

239
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,600
there's accessions from all over the

240
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,519
world like I mentioned with all

241
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,278
different selective pressures that have

242
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,039
acted upon them so capturing seeds from

243
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,519
these different accessions storing them

244
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:32,000
under optimal seed storage conditions

245
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,399
backing them up in secondary or tertiary

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,440
Gene Banks some of the seeds we make in

247
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,198
Geneva will find their way to the spard

248
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,519
seed vault in Norway for

249
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:45,799
example we

250
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,078
distribute uh regulatory compliant germ

251
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,319
plasm to an International Community at

252
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,879
no cost to provide unique alals

253
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,160
diversity to breeders to help them

254
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,639
develop locally adapted and climate

255
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:03,278
change resistant cultivars

256
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,519
I manage a database which populates a

257
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:10,120
website that's full of phenotypic and

258
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,320
genotypic information that the public

259
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,320
mostly breeders and researchers can

260
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,440
access and use that to help Empower

261
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,480
their

262
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,800
research and finally we develop data

263
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,720
tools and methods that we believe will

264
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,278
provide long-term value to the broader

265
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,519
research community

266
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:36,480
some of the traits that we're focusing

267
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:40,360
on right now are plant architecture

268
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:45,159
which has pretty profound implications

269
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,560
on uh breeding and ultimately agronomic

270
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,759
productivity flowering time is very

271
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,799
important

272
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,759
so as a plant transitions from a

273
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,599
vegetative state to a reproductive state

274
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:01,159
it it doesn't really grow much more it

275
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
diverts its energy into making seeds so

276
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:06,879
later flowering varieties tend to make

277
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,879
greater biomass and higher yields so

278
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,600
understanding this flowering tra is

279
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:15,480
important secondary metabolites so this

280
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,480
is absolutely essential to identify

281
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,399
accessions that are regulatory compliant

282
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,759
that are stay consistently below this 3%

283
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:28,078
THC also identifying unique cannabinoids

284
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,919
we still don't know everything and and

285
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,838
these gentlemen for example are working

286
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:36,559
on that

287
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,639
question um seeds fatty acids proteins

288
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,479
What's the total amount what's the

289
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,600
profile we're lucky to work with some

290
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,800
other USDA Labs that are looking into

291
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,399
this

292
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,838
question there's a USDA group in New

293
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
Orleans and Mississippi that are

294
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,560
thinking a lot about variation in fiber

295
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,639
quality in the in the stems of hemp um

296
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,758
and we're providing them all kinds of

297
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,198
materials so identifying

298
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,680
an excession with really fantastic fiber

299
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:08,319
quality and really awful fiber quality

300
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,239
cross them make an F2 population and

301
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,440
look how the progeny segregate and you

302
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,039
can identify genes that control things

303
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,040
like fiber

304
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,000
finess so here's a infographic of the

305
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,720
accessions in our collection right now

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,600
it's it's about up to

307
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,120
700 and many of these come

308
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,639
from Central eastern Southeastern Asia

309
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:41,198
um broadly there's debate But Central

310
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,399
Asian is Asia is the C Center SL centers

311
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,479
of

312
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,600
domestication and following this vovan

313
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,199
model probably where the most genetic

314
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,120
diversity occurs so we place a very high

315
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:57,399
emphasis on land races from uh Nepal

316
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,198
Northern Pakistan Tibet those kinds of

317
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,720
regions

318
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,639
here's a kind of distribution about the

319
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,079
germ

320
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
plasm by

321
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,120
geography this is how the collection has

322
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,519
grown over time so like I said you know

323
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,039
we really began adding materials at the

324
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
beginning of 2022 and it's growing

325
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,399
pretty rapidly and

326
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,199
consistently um I need to update this

327
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,958
graph actually because it's probably

328
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,439
going to be a little over 700 now and

329
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,518
then these are the seeds samples that

330
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,240
we've distributed to different breeders

331
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,919
and researchers and this has been pretty

332
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,360
consistent um growth there's what we

333
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,318
believe a pretty strong uh backed up

334
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,519
demand for diverse hemp and

335
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:51,078
plasm I am legally required to talk

336
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,399
about grin Global and give you a crash

337
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,479
course I don't know if you've ever had a

338
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,679
library librarian come to your class and

339
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,000
be like use the library it's more than

340
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,879
books um there's kind of a similar

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,640
effect here so here I've gone to Gren

342
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,160
Global that QR code takes you to this

343
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,919
website and I'm running a search here

344
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,519
for Cannabis

345
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,360
sativa um you can also look for Unique

346
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,400
accession so here's New York feral this

347
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,078
was the first accession added to our

348
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,240
collection it was de uh donated by the

349
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:29,399
Smart Lab at

350
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,880
Cornell and we can see this except is

351
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,280
available because it has the blue

352
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,760
shopping cart click that cart order it

353
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:40,000
seeds will find their way to you we also

354
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,038
collect a lot of metadata or passport

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,079
information as well um every excession

356
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,000
has their own web page that Aggregates

357
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,558
all of this information together so this

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,200
excession was collected on what was

359
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,240
described as a colonial era hemp Farm

360
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,880
rope

361
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,038
Factory and evidently it seems like the

362
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,960
that population has persisted over

363
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:08,519
time so really important you know and

364
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:13,558
that provides some context on things

365
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:16,119
like heterozygosity and um local

366
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,038
adaptation and then we have Oodles of

367
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,000
phenotypic data that's also linked to

368
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:24,279
that accession so things

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,400
like cannabinoids and flowering time can

370
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,879
all be captured um and displayed via

371
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,600
searching all right so let's talk about

372
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,440
phenotyping

373
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:41,199
efforts this is a kind of a schematic of

374
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,080
how uh these phenotypes are collected by

375
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,360
different collaborators oftentimes will

376
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,798
send seeds to the collaborator and

377
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,558
they'll um run an assay or a field trial

378
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,558
and return data to us and I will upload

379
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:57,399
it into the database and then breeders

380
00:18:53,558 --> 00:19:00,839
and researchers can access that

381
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,320
data this is a grant that we got with a

382
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,199
group uh led by Charlie brummer and

383
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,359
Daniel Pap at UC

384
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,080
Davis and we've been growing the same

385
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,719
germ plasm in these six different

386
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,918
environments and looking at a giant

387
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,960
swath of different traits so flowering

388
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,400
time and sax

389
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,120
architecture um collecting samples for

390
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,320
fiber analysis collecting seed samples

391
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,798
for fatty acids and proteins um and a

392
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,279
trial like this allows us to begin to

393
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:33,679
pull apart genot type by environmental

394
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,558
effects right so is one accession really

395
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,440
high in this environment but low in this

396
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,000
environment those kinds of questions are

397
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,880
probably really

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,119
important this is the trial that we ran

399
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,280
this

400
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:52,599
year um multiple times a week every

401
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:54,918
plant got phenotyped for multiple traits

402
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:57,558
uh this has been a honestly a

403
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:02,000
backbreaking effort but we're going to

404
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:04,279
get a enormous amount of data out of it

405
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,279
um so there's about 500 accessions that

406
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,879
are

407
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,960
replicated and we're looking at all of

408
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,000
those things I described this was you

409
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,519
can see the car in the bottom corner

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,240
just for scale and this is before the

411
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:22,279
the the the the canopy closed so it's

412
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,000
it's a jungle in there believe it or not

413
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,279
you

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,839
know back end of October there's still

415
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,000
accessions that haven't flowered yet

416
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:35,399
which is

417
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,519
wild our lab publishes this phenotyping

418
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,440
handbook that covers in gory details

419
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,879
there's pictures and equations and it's

420
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,519
not a good bedtime read but it it has a

421
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,840
lot of info about these different

422
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,359
phenotypes that we look

423
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,558
at not trying to tell people how to

424
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,038
phenotype hemp it's trying to show our

425
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:59,079
work right how do we get this

426
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,839
data folks are welcome to emulate that

427
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,558
or come up with a better plan but we

428
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,959
think that it's really important to be

429
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:10,119
hyper transparent with these research

430
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,159
efforts um so speaking of plant

431
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,918
architecture on the right we have three

432
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:19,720
plants from one excession and three from

433
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,080
another um and that's just very dramatic

434
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,000
different morphology and architecture

435
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:29,119
right so the ones on the right are a

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,720
fiber variety and you want tall thin um

437
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,759
plants with high apical dominance and

438
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,960
relatively low branching and on the the

439
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:40,200
left is a CBD type um where you want

440
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,038
more branching lower apical dominance

441
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,440
more flower production so how can we

442
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:49,798
best capture this kind of data and make

443
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,960
it available to folks and then on the

444
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:57,079
far left we see um this this is kind of

445
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,600
our favorite excession because it's so

446
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:04,038
cute and weird and it's Sur

447
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:08,798
approximately one Yun unit tall

448
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:12,200
um yes sir I wonder does does the uh sex

449
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,599
of the plant matter for fiber yes it

450
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,278
does and

451
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:20,319
there's a lot of different theories and

452
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:24,440
thoughts and except when

453
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:27,798
it and a big bottleneck is we don't have

454
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,240
a firm grip on what fiber quality is so

455
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,000
it's hard to make make concrete

456
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,640
statements about it but there's a lot of

457
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,640
belief beliefs you know the males are

458
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,360
better so forth and so on

459
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,679
um so we can visualize all of this data

460
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,038
here using this kite model that was

461
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,798
developed at at Cornell and it's a

462
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,839
really elegant way to look at a lot of

463
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,720
data at once and kind of gain an old

464
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:56,918
view so if you can see all the black

465
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,480
lines are an observation of an

466
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,840
individual plant and the colored polygon

467
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,720
is the

468
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:08,399
mean we can look at variation in

469
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,519
flowering time so this is days from

470
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:16,000
sewing to female terminal flowering and

471
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,639
there's quite a range and this isn't

472
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,679
even I chose this graph because it was

473
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,520
small enough to fit on the slide so it's

474
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,720
kind of a lot of big data that we trying

475
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,079
to turn over um to again to support

476
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,278
people that are working on these kinds

477
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,519
of questions

478
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:36,640
s very lucky to work with uh many

479
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,400
different chemists um historically we've

480
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,799
worked a lot with Corey Brownstein who

481
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:47,200
has a he kind of describes himself as a

482
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:49,759
ethnobotanist SL analytic chemist um

483
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,159
really cool background and he's been

484
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:56,558
able to just grind through thousands of

485
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,720
samples and return that data to us so we

486
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,678
can look at this and kind of gain an

487
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,278
idea about chemical profiles we're

488
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,400
working with these gentlemen to kind of

489
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:11,079
go deeper and look for more obscure

490
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Boutique canono as well we also have a

491
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:17,960
collaboration with Rog um who's a oil

492
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,880
chemist and he's been looking at seed

493
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,919
samples and composition of these

494
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,919
different fatty

495
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,159
acids uh we can compare between these

496
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,960
different environments so this is data

497
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,520
from UC Davis in Geneva New

498
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,480
York and I was actually kind of

499
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:41,440
surprised at the our squares you know

500
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,519
are in the 8 point8 or 0.9

501
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,399
range it depends on the trait so forth

502
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:51,240
and so on but there's likely fairly High

503
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:54,038
heritability to a lot of these

504
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,640
traits um we've had a great time this

505
00:24:54,038 --> 00:25:00,359
year working with the Chris and Larry

506
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,480
Smart Lab so we've been screening germ

507
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:05,278
plasm in our collection for several

508
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,240
different diseases including powdery

509
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,398
mildew and septoria yes sir how do you

510
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,240
protect your fields from the local

511
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:18,359
teenagers there's that's the the worst

512
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:22,880
past um in the in the world yeah so we

513
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:25,839
have a eight foot high fence and

514
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,600
security cameras that I can monitor on

515
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,519
my phone um and a and a very like

516
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,719
aggressively friendly stray cap that

517
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:37,278
hangs out in there too that so um but

518
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,679
that's a good question and some of these

519
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,200
plots have not are plots but this is

520
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,919
known to

521
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,600
happen so Lou and Joselyn evaluated all

522
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,200
of this different germ plasm and this

523
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,119
replicated

524
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,399
trial um and had found some pretty

525
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:56,959
promising results so along the xais or

526
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:59,879
these different accessions in our

527
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,679
collection p has done a lot of work with

528
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,360
this too um and we see quite a range and

529
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,240
there's some germ plasm that looks

530
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,119
really

531
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,839
promising same with powdery um so you

532
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,719
know these lines may not be particularly

533
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,798
good cultivars but you could use them in

534
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,038
a back Crossing scheme to move those

535
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:24,119
alals into your more Elite

536
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:26,000
lines uh some tool and Method

537
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:29,199
developments I'm a little behind

538
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
schedule already so the

539
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,798
idea about regenerating all of this germ

540
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,798
plasm and maintaining Purity not

541
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:37,918
allowing

542
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,679
cross-pollination is a tough one and we

543
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,880
must increase our throughput so we're

544
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:48,960
trying a lot of these different designs

545
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,919
to do regenerations in a field so we've

546
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,038
made several iterations of these hemp

547
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:58,799
Huts that are based on special fabric

548
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:03,720
with 15 Micron por size um which we know

549
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:06,440
is should be competent to exclude pollen

550
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,480
they're collapsible modular we can fit

551
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,159
them over a directly seated

552
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,480
plot um we run negative controls in

553
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:19,320
these so feminized or female only

554
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,480
populations um are grown in some of the

555
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,879
tents and we crack them open if we find

556
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,679
seeds we know they don't work right um

557
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,360
so we're still in testing and design and

558
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,200
it's a lot of uh you know scientists

559
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,639
trying to to build things and so the you

560
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,880
know the may not be the most elegant but

561
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,240
we think this is really important um and

562
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,399
the goal is to publish the blueprint

563
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,599
make it publicly available and help

564
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:49,398
other

565
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:51,798
folks uh this has been one of my

566
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,038
favorite parts of this job is to work

567
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:57,158
with different groups especially

568
00:27:54,038 --> 00:28:01,640
breeding insights who's based right here

569
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:04,799
um which is a USD USDA funded Cornell

570
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,038
project and these guys are you know

571
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,359
Wizards so we were interested in

572
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:16,000
quantifying leaf morphology and this

573
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:17,278
gentleman AJ um cooked up a tool from

574
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,038
you know from

575
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:23,159
scratch that uh relies on this Imaging

576
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,319
template with the colored dots which are

577
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,360
known diameter and distance from each

578
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,798
other you can take a picture with a cell

579
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,000
phone that has the fieldbook app on it

580
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:36,759
which tags that image with the

581
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,519
appropriate metadata then you can do his

582
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:43,720
pipeline does some fancy linear algebra

583
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:46,759
and rotates that image and crops it um

584
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,759
and then you can extract out all of this

585
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:55,119
kind of data so things like area and

586
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:58,839
width morphology but also uh you can

587
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,199
count every single serration on the Lea

588
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:04,038
which

589
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,840
is wild to me and so instead of trying

590
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:09,158
to cut leaves and put them in Ziploc

591
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,720
bags and driving to the lab and image

592
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,679
them under a hot lamp and they're

593
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,120
wilting just do it in the field the

594
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,399
throughput is orders of magnitude higher

595
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:23,239
uh it can even handle multiple images

596
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:25,398
and separate them so incredible work uh

597
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,798
AJ has even been able to kind of use

598
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:28,918
this data to pull out G by effects so

599
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:30,839
different

600
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,278
same germ plasm different environments

601
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,839
and seeing kind of broader

602
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,159
patterns we think pollen is going to be

603
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,759
absolutely essential to the long-term

604
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,840
success of our project so Distributing

605
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,319
seeds and pollen in parallel so it

606
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:50,000
allows breeders to get a lot more alals

607
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,480
quickly to make crosses pollen is also

608
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,880
great because it can break the temporal

609
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,038
separation and flowering time so when

610
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,840
one female parent is ready you just pull

611
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,440
pull the pollen out and you don't have

612
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,359
to try to coordinate that with the male

613
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,480
flower

614
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:10,038
um this is really hard work and to the

615
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,399
best of our knowledge there's no really

616
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:16,440
good protocols or standard operating

617
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:19,398
procedures on how to do this um pollen

618
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,558
viability drops very quickly so this is

619
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:26,359
some of the work that Gabby has been

620
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:29,038
running and by default you know by 12

621
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,000
hours you have

622
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:36,158
less than 5% or so

623
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,038
viability um so you probably could put

624
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,760
pollen in a freezer and hold on to it

625
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,879
for several months and make a cross but

626
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,480
as we're a gene Bank we need to push

627
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,200
that envelope to its absolute extreme so

628
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,278
we're thinking can we hold on to viable

629
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,558
pollen for 10 years so we're kind of

630
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,798
moving through this very complicated

631
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,918
search space of different parameters

632
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:02,200
that will enable um longterm pollen

633
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,519
storage we made

634
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,798
this contraption which is a Spore trap

635
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,638
connected to a backpack vacuum that

636
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:15,720
allows us to Hoover up Oodles of pollen

637
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:18,798
so Dan is collecting like 10 grams of

638
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:23,319
pollen from a single plant in under a

639
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:25,519
minute um which is incredible to me and

640
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:28,558
then you know it's we're germinating the

641
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,319
pollen under BK media here

642
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,918
um the media kind of picked up on this

643
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:38,278
um because we we published the template

644
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,960
and and how we made it um

645
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:43,200
so I think I need to move a little

646
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,159
faster sorry

647
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,360
Gabby um so this question of hemp fiber

648
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,799
quality is a really big one it's it's

649
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,599
hard for people to get their heads

650
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:56,398
around and it's complicated and probably

651
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:59,839
controlled by a lot of different genes

652
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:02,239
um we're working with this USDA group

653
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:06,359
that has historically done a lot of the

654
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,159
cotton fiber quality standards and

655
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,678
so imp is very different but they're

656
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,080
trying to figure out what tools they

657
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,240
need they can adapt versus tools they

658
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:21,359
need to make um here's kind of some

659
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:24,000
variation in the types of fiber products

660
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:28,398
this is an image on the right that Tony

661
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,880
made um four cultivars on the rows and

662
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,638
the columns are 0

663
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,559
to four six and eight weeks of ring so

664
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:40,798
this allows the fibers to be more

665
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:43,200
readily separated from the stems so

666
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,918
there's a genetic component to it as

667
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,200
well as as well as very important

668
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,000
agronomic and cultural

669
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,000
conditions so this group that we're

670
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,038
working with developed all of this equip

671
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,599
they they made this lab grade

672
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,119
decorticator from scratch

673
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:05,278
um so you can feed a single stem through

674
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:09,278
here um pulls the fiber out measures the

675
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:12,960
energy required to remove the fiber from

676
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:17,200
that stem collects other data and then

677
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,038
that uh fiber gets pushed into all these

678
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,639
other types of equipment so tinsil

679
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:28,398
strength Optical sensing color you name

680
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:29,839
it um oh no

681
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,798
sorry about

682
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:35,918
this so we can look at uh many different

683
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:39,200
traits that we we think will likely be

684
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,240
linked to this concept of fiber

685
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,840
quality um work a lot with my friend and

686
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,679
colleague Tyler Gordon who is kind of

687
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,319
trying to take the germ plasm to the

688
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,559
next level so he's doing a lot of

689
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:56,240
pre-breeding and early selection and

690
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,720
selfing so we coordinate pretty well um

691
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,558
during the selfing process where we'll

692
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,880
run those chemotype markers on it and he

693
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:06,720
can select out regulatory compliant

694
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,159
materials and begin selfing them down

695
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,000
then we can distribute that seed from a

696
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,480
otherwise non-compliant accession to

697
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,239
breeders and

698
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,800
researchers uh finally and

699
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,759
overwhelmingly um we have this

700
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,280
enormous genotyping sequencing project

701
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,000
that we've done this year this is in

702
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,040
collaboration with our friends at the

703
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,480
Hudson Alpha Institute Alex harus and

704
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:37,398
philb um so we have collected

705
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:43,079
approximately four individuals from 500

706
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:45,519
accessions for pack bio Hi-Fi low pass

707
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,480
sequencing um they are particularly

708
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:53,440
interested in sex expression and

709
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,719
cannabis good luck um they'll figure it

710
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,880
out I'm sure but um as a germplasm

711
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,959
curator I want to the population

712
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,760
structure the diversity of this

713
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,440
giant pool of germplasm from all over

714
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,359
the place um and I believe that this

715
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,880
will guide a lot of breeding and

716
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:16,078
conservation and population development

717
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,760
efforts

718
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,400
Downstream um I think the future of germ

719
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,000
plasm collections will be you can order

720
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,680
seeds and download genomic data or

721
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,400
download a genome all at once I think

722
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,639
that's really exciting and just now

723
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,960
becoming

724
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,480
plausible um and we're excited about

725
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,039
developing different mapping

726
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,920
populations um this is we've seen this

727
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:44,719
slide but this year

728
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,480
we've found 200 pardon me

729
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,639
2,000 individuals from this field and

730
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,639
we've had to use molecular markers to

731
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:55,279
track down males and females to send

732
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:59,759
tissue on dry ice down to

733
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:04,319
Alabama um and then finally uh we're

734
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:07,520
working with breeding Insight um again

735
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:10,759
to develop this public marker panel

736
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,800
system so the idea is can we take

737
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,520
advantage of this germ plasm collection

738
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,519
to make a marker panel that's very aware

739
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:24,559
of all these different kinds of hemp um

740
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:27,318
but it needs to be reliable and low cost

741
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,239
um and then the additional thing is we

742
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:32,159
want this to be Community Driven so

743
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:33,879
we're able to choose about 3,000 sites

744
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,879
and we've asked many different

745
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,760
stakeholders you know what's the stamp

746
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,920
of Interest what do you use in your

747
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,200
group and many of those folks have

748
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,800
already contributed different um genetic

749
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,719
markers that we can include in this

750
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,318
panel so the goal is to make a community

751
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,000
resource that will

752
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:53,639
benefit

753
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,760
everyone uh George stack is leading this

754
00:36:53,639 --> 00:37:00,480
effort it's been great to have him on

755
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,800
our team um and danan is the genomics

756
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,318
coordinator at breeding insights and

757
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,318
she's a delight to work with and has

758
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:10,960
been giving us a lot of guidance on this

759
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:14,480
process as well um in fact here's dian's

760
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:19,358
slide with a some really nice Graphics

761
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,838
um and this shows how um a breeder might

762
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,639
take advantage of this mid coverage

763
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:27,639
genotyping

764
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:29,639
platform um this is was a hard slide to

765
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,118
make to cram people on here I know I've

766
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,318
missed folks um the the best part of

767
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,519
this job is is the people and working

768
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,800
with um so many brilliant and

769
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:43,039
interesting folks um I think we need a a

770
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,640
space race for hemp the research is 50

771
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:48,440
to 70 years behind and we need a lot of

772
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,799
resources and people kind of addressing

773
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,000
different topics I love to be a

774
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,680
germplasm curator because we we're kind

775
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,318
of in the middle of that um we can look

776
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,078
at a lot of these questions through the

777
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:04,318
lens of genetic diversity and find

778
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:07,960
variation that occurs in here um I also

779
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:10,440
really want to thank germ plasm donors

780
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,880
um folks from all over the world that

781
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,480
have stewarded and maintained the these

782
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,720
crops that's wasn't hasn't always been

783
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,679
an easy thing to do um and I'm very

784
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,399
appreciative of their willingness to

785
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,759
contribute some of those materials to

786
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,200
this public germ plasm collection so I

787
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,359
think we can leave it here um questions

788
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,960
I will try

789
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,639
to repeat them and also ask Geneva if

790
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,599
they have any

791
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:46,440
questions um so let's I guess start

792
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,680
with Geneva or pardon me itha

793
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,800
folks questions here have you thought

794
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:58,279
about the impact on your program of uh

795
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:01,079
IC uh cabus is legalized or

796
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,760
uh allow you know you can't work on on

797
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,640
it at the federal level now but um

798
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,119
imagine that would double your program

799
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:12,719
or yeah that's a great question it's

800
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,079
hypothetical and that's one for the

801
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:19,199
politicians and the voters to figure out

802
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,760
um and I don't want to speculate too

803
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,838
much on what that future scenario might

804
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,640
look like that being

805
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:30,920
said again people use this species for

806
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:32,719
many different purposes and you know

807
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,920
they have different sets of priorities

808
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:39,318
so is that conceivable I I can't rule it

809
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,200
out yet and in fact we do hold a DEA

810
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:45,199
registration so we can you know it's

811
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,279
kind of a a chicken and egg thing where

812
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,759
we can't distribute it until we know it

813
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,240
has less than .3% total THC but we don't

814
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,000
know that till we grow it and test it so

815
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:59,078
forth and so on so that's why we have

816
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,838
that protection um from or authorization

817
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,640
from the DEA um but it's it's it's hard

818
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:07,239
to say I don't

819
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,759
know it but a good

820
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,118
question

821
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,800
next yes ma'am um so in terms of you're

822
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,480
maintaining a lot of exceptions what

823
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,680
does that maintenance look like in terms

824
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,159
of how often do you have to you know

825
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,318
pull seeds out grow them collect more

826
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,399
seeds just to keep it comfortably

827
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:28,639
maintain great question and that's super

828
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,280
important and I

829
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:36,679
lay in bed and and think about this a

830
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:39,839
lot right um so first and foremost

831
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:41,639
um as hemp has been outside of the

832
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,039
scientific world for so long we don't

833
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,759
have a lot of longitudinal long-term

834
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,000
studies on how long seed viability can

835
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,040
be maintained for under optimal

836
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,960
conditions I can tell you that I've

837
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,400
germinated some seeds that were made in

838
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,920
the 990s which is

839
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,800
encouraging um the discouraging fact is

840
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,599
there's kind of an inverse relationship

841
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,079
between the oil content of seeds and

842
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,599
Longevity broadly speaking and and hemp

843
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:12,000
is is generally considered high

844
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:15,599
oil um we we don't know what the maximum

845
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,079
lifespan you can juice out of hemp seeds

846
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,680
um I can tell you that we're making a

847
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,560
lot of efforts to scale up regenerations

848
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,318
and the growth Chambers and green houses

849
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:32,000
that we have access to we're running 24

850
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:34,639
s right now um and then we're also very

851
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,519
lucky to work with um many different

852
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:40,118
collaborators including some of the um

853
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,400
Sunni system for example Morrisville has

854
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,559
a large growth chamber and she's working

855
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,440
Kelly henan is working to regenerate a

856
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,880
lot of these materials for us as well so

857
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,838
it takes it's going to take a village um

858
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,318
there's some other systems where we can

859
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,799
use small exclusion tents inside of

860
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,199
growth Chambers to kind of multiply the

861
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,640
number of sessions that can be

862
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:04,838
regenerated at once um but it's hard to

863
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,480
do it

864
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:10,159
right thank you you

865
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,760
that yes so you have mentioned that

866
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:17,199
phenotyping is really a hard work like

867
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,240
do you consider about using this UAB for

868
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,719
collecting different data sets in the

869
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:25,838
future or yes great question um there's

870
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:29,759
a lot of work at Cornell uh that are

871
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:32,679
applying uavs to this me Murdoch is kind

872
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,359
of a genius she's in the Smart Lab and

873
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,399
has been doing a lot of work to train

874
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:40,679
different models can you remote sense

875
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,559
for cannabinoids for example maybe um I

876
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:46,598
haven't seen some of her latest data um

877
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,079
there's also work being done with

878
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,079
robotics driving a robot through Imaging

879
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,920
making 3D images of the plants that kind

880
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:57,200
of stuff I

881
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,240
think this is probably broadly true for

882
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,039
Agricultural Science that will'll see a

883
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,959
greater amount of integration of these

884
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:08,079
kinds of high throughput phenotyping

885
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,358
tools like drones and robots um and I'm

886
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,839
very excited to apply

887
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:14,880
those but there's also a lot to be said

888
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,679
for good old yard stick Horticulture as

889
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,000
well get out there look at a plan and

890
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,000
measure

891
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,480
it okay Geneva

892
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,960
questions

893
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,079
um so are you

894
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,599
or anyone in your group looking to

895
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,599
identify herbicide tolerant traits from

896
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,240
this genetically diverse germplasm yeah

897
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,838
a little bit um so this would be a great

898
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,799
question for ly

899
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:47,719
Sosi um we haven't run a herbicide

900
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,000
resistance trial yet but I think that's

901
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:54,000
that's a good idea U and that might be

902
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
something we could tag team with Lynn

903
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:03,160
on okay I think that that might oh do

904
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:06,799
Sean says do mous individuals self

905
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,239
feriz um I think that is quite

906
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,800
possible I'm not going to say in every

907
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,279
instance that will occur I'm not aware

908
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,240
of like self-incompatibility work in

909
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,839
hemp per se but broadly speaking mous

910
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:22,679
individuals are considered uh possible

911
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:22,679
to self

912
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:28,558
fertilize all right I think that's all

913
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:31,879
of our questions

914
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,880
okay all right thanks

915
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,400
everyone this has been a production of

916
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,400
