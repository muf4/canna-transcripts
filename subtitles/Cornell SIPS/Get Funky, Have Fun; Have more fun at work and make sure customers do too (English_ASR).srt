12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,049
of the things I am and I think there's

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,268
might be some lies in there too that I'm

14

nonsense are my no nonsense

16
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,299
I think I'm not no nonsense it's hard to

17
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,628
say I'm a blogger I've written a

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,819
gardening blog for 12 years which in

19
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:55,769
blogging is a really long time I started

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,899
working in garden centers in my 20s

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,329
after being a manager at Starbucks it

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,870
was like totally normal right manager at

23
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,789
Starbucks

24
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,618
quit that frappuccinos came out I was

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,149
like screw this I'm out of here I'm

26
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,868
going to go water plants for ten years

27
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:12,719
and that's what I did so I've been

28
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,129
working in gardening since then I'm a

29
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,609
very serious person

30
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:19,348
I make no jokes at all and I never lie

31
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:21,719
I'm a mom a daisy troop leader a

32
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,490
Chicagoan I'm a columnist at Green

33
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,140
profit I'm assuming that's why I'm here

34
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,449
and it's not the baby troop leader part

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,659
but you never know

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,159
I'm humorless I'm a speaker I have a

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,810
tattoo of social pruners on my arm

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,280
because I there are the nicest things

39
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,750
I've ever owned it's when I got the

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,728
tattoo it was the nicest thing I'd ever

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,099
owned was was two pairs of self Oh

42
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,700
pruners I never had any quality tools in

43
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,810
my life until then and I'm very bland

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,549
and boring and I have terrible eyesight

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,409
does me now you know everything about me

46
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:59,789
that's all you need to know so garden

47
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,519
centers are my big my big thing and I go

48
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,310
to every garden center I can I could I

49
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,859
could plan vacations around stuffing at

50
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,149
garden centers and I notice a lot of

51
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,139
things and a lot of things that we're

52
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,959
doing right a lot of things that we're

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,598
doing wrong my first thing is why why

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,789
garden centers are retail but they don't

55
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,590
know one who owns when it runs on it

56
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,280
often runs one like it is retail it's

57
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,219
like those rules don't apply to us

58
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,930
a lot of customers don't really get how

59
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:29,419
to shop new customers don't really get

60
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,980
how to shop for plants or how to operate

61
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,299
in the garden center and another

62
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,379
Starbucks reference do you remember the

63
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,340
first time you went to Starbucks when

64
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,159
you were like you needed to have a

65
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,689
friend to help you figure it out well

66
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,609
guess what garden centers are like that

67
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,120
for new gardeners and new shoppers they

68
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,590
have no idea where to get your wagon or

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,450
where to check out or how things work

70
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,700
because it's not like the grocery store

71
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:53,899
or Target or growth of the drugstore or

72
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:57,409
anything it's just totally different

73
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,849
rules and we don't really go we don't

74
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:01,310
really try to help with new people at

75
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,229
all so I love this idea which is like a

76
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,909
new new gardener start here I don't

77
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,409
think it's like the flashiest display

78
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,439
ever I think I would totally kick this

79
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,120
up a few notches but this is a good

80
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:16,009
representation of a beginning I also a

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,269
big fan of having a having picking a

82
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,739
night of the month or a night of the

83
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,180
week or a day of the week and this is

84
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,459
new customer day you put out the banner

85
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,370
hey every Tuesday new customers welcome

86
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,590
we have extra special staff here to help

87
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,239
new people there extra patient and extra

88
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,170
smart every Tuesday of course it's the

89
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:37,430
same staff you always have but Stephanie

90
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:39,738
you guys right now you get some t-shirts

91
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,569
like we are the special Tuesday extra

92
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,819
caring sensitive staff for new people

93
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,750
and of course it's just the same people

94
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:50,209
so beginners say once or twice a month

95
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,799
or you can advertise it you can use

96
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,170
social media which I know everyone loves

97
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,180
so much and they're praying I don't talk

98
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,669
about what your prayers will go

99
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,560
unanswered you can have beginner

100
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,479
specialists of course the same old

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,579
people and you make sure that you post

102
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,699
banners saying beginners are welcome a

103
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:11,870
beginners welcome banner on a beautiful

104
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:14,539
established garden center is a huge deal

105
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,819
to someone who always drove I was always

106
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:18,819
curious but scared poopless to go in

107
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:24,849
it happens I know it's hard to imagine

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,579
infographics are really important

109
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,600
I hate handouts and I'm still doing this

110
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,859
anyways because they're the right thing

111
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,270
to do just because I hate handouts

112
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,160
they're killing trees and there's no

113
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,689
really great way to hand em out other

114
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,790
than those little plastic take one

115
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:39,009
things there's something that you should

116
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,080
have maybe even at the register you

117
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,819
should also have your own infographics

118
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:48,310
and offer them online and use them in

119
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:52,599
social media make sure that you're using

120
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,980
a merchandising to lead the way lead

121
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,200
people all the way through your garden

122
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,350
center from the beginning and so that

123
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,990
they hit everything that you want use

124
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,040
potted plants to move people through so

125
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,110
that they can't get through to other

126
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,720
areas you want to lead them all the way

127
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,850
through make sure that their eye is

128
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,990
going exactly where you want them to and

129
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,900
you're hiding the things you don't want

130
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,920
them the same so this is a great way to

131
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,279
funnel they're funneling people right

132
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,770
towards the door and here's another

133
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,500
great way you not follow a line of

134
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:25,299
bowling balls right who is not curious

135
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,980
about what's going on at once you want

136
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,040
that wood is going to go on past there

137
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,509
it costs next to nothing to use bowling

138
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,280
balls I know this for sure because I

139
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:36,250
have them at my house and Mike neighbors

140
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,779
complain about them it costs nothing to

141
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,790
do this and people are always curious

142
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,289
and pizza delivery guys love me my

143
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,060
neighbors don't but the pizza delivery

144
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,040
guys they get me and really who do I

145
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,290
need to impress in life the pizza

146
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,160
delivery guys are my neighbors pizza

147
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,660
delivery guys every time if one pizza

148
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,130
delivery guy had just had twins

149
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,470
Luke and Leia and I was like we're this

150
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,939
we are you are my people Luke and Leia

151
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,770
you are my people

152
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,300
so I don't care what the neighbors I

153
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,889
care about the guy who's a dad of Luke

154
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,920
and Leia that makes him Jarrett's Peter

155
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:09,629
I don't I didn't spoil anything for you

156
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,629
that movie came out in 1977

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,170
okay so while you're leading people

158
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,000
around your store you also want to

159
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,680
inspire them give them ideas how things

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,660
can come together and this is how you

161
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,980
add the sales they don't just want to

162
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,210
come in for one plant they come in for

163
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,410
two plants that come in for the pasta to

164
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,719
come in for the soil that buy everything

165
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,910
so you're directing people through your

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,650
garden center while you're also selling

167
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:34,450
them ideas my favorite favorite garden

168
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:36,370
center trick is to use the ground know

169
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,949
no one ever does that I make arrows

170
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,129
through garden centers I write soil this

171
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:45,399
way and draw an arrow I've made very

172
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:49,300
intricate oriental rugs underneath patio

173
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:52,029
sets out of chalk I also get young

174
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,169
people like six seven eight years old to

175
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,209
help me out with that so it's really

176
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:58,359
obviously very elaborate and always

177
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:00,839
stays within the lines chalk paint you

178
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,879
name it use the ground to direct people

179
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,310
you can use stuff to dish ously I know

180
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,719
that we get in that truckload of 300

181
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,240
knockout roses and we just make a pile

182
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,800
of 300 knockout roses right there none

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,180
of those knockout roses going to extract

184
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,418
but it just stay in a pile until they

185
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,370
dwindle in September use things more

186
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:20,319
judiciously so use those 300 knockout

187
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,019
roses to make your entire path going all

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,159
the way down yeah it's more work but

189
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,069
they're there you might have will use

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,900
them and then use actual visual

191
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,639
merchandizing cues like at the grocery

192
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,918
store where they keep the milk in the

193
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,550
back you just put those pink petunias in

194
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:39,129
the back right put the the hanging

195
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,900
baskets in the back so people have to go

196
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,939
through and be subjected to all your

197
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:45,668
awesome products and awesome ideas on

198
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:47,899
the way back to get those totally boring

199
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:53,359
things

200
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:57,019
so in the kiss my after vortex from one

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,790
to ten of how boring or cool a display

202
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,919
could be this is like a 1 this is like

203
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,040
as boring as a display could be as

204
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,160
luscious as this point could be it's

205
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,100
just a little bit better than basic this

206
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:14,840
is not it's cool but it's not that cool

207
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:17,600
we can do better now we're now we're

208
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,639
talking we got some color we got some

209
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,530
weird stuff in there it's not enough

210
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,180
plants for my liking but it's giving

211
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,429
ideas it's giving people permission

212
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,829
which I think that people desperately

213
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,949
need these days permission to let their

214
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:33,590
freak flag fly in their backyard

215
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:36,500
gardening used to be an expression of

216
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,720
creativity and I feel now like it's

217
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,240
becoming more of an expression of God

218
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,700
don't let my neighbors hate me it's like

219
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,180
it's like this bar is set for like beige

220
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,970
beige gardening and we need to bring

221
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:53,719
back the weird in gardening and that is

222
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,850
why I have two mannequins and twelve

223
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,940
pipe organ pipes in mics and in my

224
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:02,269
garden I'm doing my part to help all of

225
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:05,870
you bring gardening back to fun and

226
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:11,809
funky so what can you do to create a

227
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:15,169
conversation I feel like many gardening

228
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:18,589
centers are ruled with the fear of what

229
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:20,809
if I upset somebody and we left that one

230
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,670
squeaky person who complains that

231
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:26,869
something's inappropriate or something's

232
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:28,189
not not right or not it's just not the

233
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,750
what the thing that they want to see and

234
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,790
we let that one person who's going to

235
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,409
complain keep us from impressing a lot

236
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:39,409
more people if that bus loads of people

237
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,639
who be like that's cool I want I want to

238
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,289
talk about this place I want to

239
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,970
Instagram this place I want to tell my

240
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,490
friends like hey they have this sign of

241
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,160
like a prayer Karen this is what we want

242
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,740
right we we want to create a buzz and a

243
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,360
sensation with very little effort this

244
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,509
is just a little bit of paint and a lot

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,009
of cactuses right but it's funny I know

246
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,509
when I go into a garden center that

247
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,610
these are my people and

248
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,379
that I'm going to from seeing a sign

249
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,370
like this I know that I'm going to get

250
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,679
along with the people that work there

251
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,810
get along with the management and that

252
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,849
they probably have cooler stuff than

253
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:23,659
other garden centers that may not take

254
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:25,220
this kind of a risk matter no so again

255
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:27,199
this is this tells me that I'm shopping

256
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,620
someplace cool it makes me feel cool to

257
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,940
be there and and I know that the people

258
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,789
that work there have a sense of humor

259
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,500
and that they that they are going to

260
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:38,000
have something to talk to me about that

261
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,460
they have something to offer me and I'm

262
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,940
just so into that I want to connect with

263
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,139
the people that work there this I was

264
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,580
surprised this is a garden center I

265
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,179
never would have gone into it's the kind

266
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,220
of it's still in Chicago but it's just

267
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,539
outside of Chicago and it's the kind of

268
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,950
place that I would have driven past I

269
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:57,349
just figured that they have dreams and

270
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,660
spikes never would go in there I saw

271
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,879
this and I'm like going in I'm going to

272
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,889
go in I'm going to obviously I was wrong

273
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:11,570
about them they're obviously cool and

274
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:13,639
funny and I was wrong it doesn't cost

275
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,230
anything right and you don't even have

276
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,939
to really be that original this stuff's

277
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,889
out there who hasn't done that we're so

278
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,890
excited we wet our plants it's still

279
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:24,409
funny we've all seen it we've all been

280
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,819
scented into our inboxes 37 times in 30

281
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:28,039
sometime you're like yeah what our plans

282
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,629
huh but guess what it's still funny you

283
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:34,309
still put that plant out front people

284
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:36,049
are still going to laugh it's it doesn't

285
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:39,049
take much people

286
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:41,509
it doesn't take much we're still with it

287
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:43,309
I mean it they're having fun it's

288
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,809
something that you know going back in

289
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,129
social media this is something that if I

290
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,539
swap us in a garden center I would

291
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:49,220
absolutely share this I would absolutely

292
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,740
put it on my Facebook page and send it

293
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,110
out to four thousand people and I would

294
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,490
share the location of this and we would

295
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,789
have everyone would have a little talk

296
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,740
about it and we're not we're just not

297
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:08,208
having this kind of fun day today

298
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:10,430
I know aquascape has a peeing dog water

299
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:12,739
feature have any of you seen that so

300
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:15,199
it's like 24-hour of dog peeing you can

301
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,230
have it anywhere you want just like but

302
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,540
I like this too I would maybe think that

303
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,209
a storefront like this was a little too

304
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:26,328
fancy for me because I like a little bit

305
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:27,500
of a I don't know a challenge but it

306
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:32,208
would this out front I would absolutely

307
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,589
check it out this would be the number

308
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:37,518
one thing that would get me into a

309
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:40,820
garden center I feel I know garden

310
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,409
centers have they make a list of their

311
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,079
top selling plants and they eliminate

312
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:47,269
the bottom what 15% every year the

313
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:49,250
bottom 15% are exactly what I want to be

314
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,199
lying I want to be buying those bottom

315
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,200
15% who you don't get rid of the bottom

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,390
15% take that bottom 15% put it on an

317
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,009
end cap and have a have a sales person

318
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,389
standing there being like these are

319
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,708
weird plants and this is why they're

320
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:02,419
weird and this is how you can grow them

321
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:06,729
and then you have weird plants even

322
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:08,838
people who don't know a petunia from a

323
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,370
tomato steak

324
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,630
want to have something cool and

325
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,209
different but they just needed to

326
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:14,929
explain to them so why are we we're

327
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,399
becoming more

328
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,679
so basically we're becoming more like

329
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,809
the big boxes and just selling basic

330
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:26,739
stuff and getting rid of the cool stuff

331
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:26,739
oh gosh it makes me good it bothers me I

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,889
think we could use this a garden center

333
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,528
super sexy fail we need the sexy and

334
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:40,399
gardening bring it plants are all about

335
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:43,429
sex it's not untrue we can have the

336
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,820
geranium super sexy geranium sale let's

337
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,819
do it

338
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:55,759
color-blocking that's some photo worthy

339
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:57,289
right it doesn't cost much to make a

340
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,389
display like this and this is I think

341
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:00,889
it's for a grub in California which is

342
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,629
something that people have photographs

343
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,399
of thousands of time and shared these

344
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,139
photos thousands of times and when

345
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,759
people take a vacation out there

346
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:10,250
something that they want to see and take

347
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,289
their picture next to can you imagine

348
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,799
having your garden Center as a vacation

349
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:17,659
destination why not I mean why can't you

350
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,299
imagine that how much do you think it

351
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:22,250
costs to get an old rusty car dropped in

352
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:25,069
your garden center and use it as a shelf

353
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:32,509
or plant I just need the space right and

354
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:34,850
the rat so realistically you're not

355
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:36,200
going to copycat this but I will tell

356
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,360
you the story I worked at a gardening

357
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,490
center in downtown Chicago which is a

358
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,440
weird place to be to be selling plants

359
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,810
and look up and there's skyscrapers all

360
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,480
around it was an unusual place to sell

361
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:49,279
plants to people who never felt didn't

362
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,259
feel grass near their feet in a daily

363
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,019
basis so it wasn't already an unusual

364
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:56,090
customer base two of my three of my

365
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,639
greatest fights with customers there the

366
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,620
first guy who was really upset that I

367
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,699
told him that Boston Ivy wouldn't grow

368
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,190
on his entertainment system the woman

369
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,140
who didn't understand why I told her she

370
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,930
couldn't have a cut leaf Japanese maple

371
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:14,330
growing in her dining room but my

372
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:16,489
favorite is the guy who wanted he had a

373
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,710
Fraser for a fresh cut Fraser Fir for

374
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,210
Christmas he called us in March he said

375
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,220
you you don't understand it's really

376
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,000
doing very well I'm a wealthy man I'd

377
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,790
like you to root this for me

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,049
and I made the mistake of saying sir we

379
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:31,389
can't do that I really should have just

380
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:38,019
taken his money and giving him a balding

381
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:39,220
burlap Frasier for what well with me but

382
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,870
it looks a little different well it's

383
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,519
been through it's been through some

384
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:48,060
things the routing process is very

385
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:51,789
difficult sir so ask this garden center

386
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:55,508
for fall when things are slowing down

387
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:58,448
I took a good 48 inch terra cotta pot

388
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:02,259
and put a rebar in it and I built those

389
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:04,328
three cage topiaries out of chicken wire

390
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:06,459
filled it with moss and soil and

391
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,559
inserted little 4-inch cabbages so it

392
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:11,258
was it was like 12 feet tall when I was

393
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,049
done and I never got to being done

394
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:17,879
because it turns out nothing sells four

395
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:20,349
inch cabbages at 795 in downtown Chicago

396
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,149
like like someone playing with them

397
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,500
basically me touching them and adding

398
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,899
them to this topiary ain't meant that

399
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:31,600
they sold faster than any cabbages have

400
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:33,970
ever sold for 795 so I never got to

401
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,240
finish it because it just drew so much

402
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,889
attention the act of putting a display

403
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,259
together in front of other people if

404
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:42,879
theater people like it there's a story

405
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,769
cute hey I bought this cabbage today it

406
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,149
was 795 but this lady was putting it at

407
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:49,058
the top of this it was going to be the

408
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:52,528
last one so I bought it there's the kind

409
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,528
of person that appeals to you sadly

410
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,639
there's all kinds of things you can use

411
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,500
to make things cool and give them a

412
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,759
story hey I bought this horse tail rush

413
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,890
today it was in an old rusty Dasom hey I

414
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,110
bought some succulents they were under a

415
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:12,069
decrepid piano it was kind of cool I

416
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:14,198
took a picture it's not just a plant

417
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:18,609
it's an experience buying something out

418
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:21,130
of a old stove this is at a garden

419
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:23,500
center outside of Chicago you can't

420
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,419
really tell it's lit up at night and

421
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,328
they're old shovels and rakes that had

422
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:30,759
been coated with glue and glitter toss

423
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:32,349
them nothing these things end up as sign

424
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,970
holders to hang them from the greenhouse

425
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:37,159
ceiling and they hang signs off of it

426
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,259
they lay them on either side

427
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,110
a walk way to guide people from walking

428
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,910
they've used these littered tools for

429
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:45,589
everything and they just have a ton of

430
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,650
them so it didn't cost anything that to

431
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:50,629
do it and it's just a really fun thing

432
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,180
for them something for everybody

433
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,260
glitters fun for everybody I know that

434
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,740
you don't want me to talk about social

435
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:59,180
media but I have to so here are some

436
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,400
things that I know about social media

437
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,750
that come with fun and funky is that

438
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,550
even when you're posting things and

439
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,200
there's no interactions it seems like no

440
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:07,700
one's looking that's the new thing that

441
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,350
the kids are doing now is that they

442
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,930
don't even give you a like it's not even

443
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:15,439
if they're if it's so cool they won't

444
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,029
even push like so you just have to just

445
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,580
have to keep going even though you're

446
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,430
getting absolutely no validation for it

447
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:24,259
at all and just because you're the boss

448
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,400
doesn't mean you need to be doing social

449
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,859
media you need to find someone who

450
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,390
enjoys doing it and let them do it and

451
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:31,699
it doesn't have to be one person it can

452
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:36,470
be a team of people and I can't push

453
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:40,759
Instagram at you hard enough in other

454
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,259
industries they are using our tools for

455
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,470
visual merchandising way better than we

456
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:47,569
are let's let that soak in for a second

457
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,779
we're selling high-end

458
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:56,659
shoes here using our wheelbarrows what's

459
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:59,809
up with that so this is a little fancy

460
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,700
jewelry store using our stuff would we

461
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,559
ever think of using that no to us these

462
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,960
are tools you don't use these interest

463
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:12,109
it would be bizarre but it isn't we

464
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,970
should be doing this it's pointing down

465
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:17,199
basically they're like arrows pointing

466
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,200
down at the things they want you to buy

467
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,730
make sure that we're merchandising for

468
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,830
all generations and all price points I'm

469
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,200
a big believer in terrariums because

470
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:30,589
they can be made for nothing we can use

471
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,009
things we find on the ground at work to

472
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:35,809
make a terrarium right little droppings

473
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,160
of succulents little pieces of this and

474
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,339
little pieces of that they cost nothing

475
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,110
I make them out of old spaghetti jars

476
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,240
Ball jars things I find as a thrift

477
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:46,819
store we could be making and selling

478
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,589
terrariums for next to nothing and that

479
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,579
can be a really great draw and it's a

480
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,579
really great draw in the winter

481
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,910
here they're using the health strip

482
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:04,119
gardening book to to market both the

483
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,250
book and the plant so this is a very

484
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,229
specific kind of gardening for city

485
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,869
dwellers people who have that that

486
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,819
health strip you know that is right the

487
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:14,918
area between the road and the sidewalk

488
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:16,928
so it's also for me it's the pizza oven

489
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,940
because all that hard scape and gets so

490
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,669
hot that everything just wants to to

491
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,900
kind of burn up and die there so so

492
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,070
they're selling the books they're cross

493
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,240
promoting with the plants they have

494
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:31,418
taken the plants from the book and

495
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:34,720
they're they're doing that I believe

496
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:36,549
that the Millennials have burned through

497
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,058
the air plants and they won't be doing

498
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:39,099
that again

499
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:41,619
and now they're burning through

500
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:43,808
succulents and cactuses are it there

501
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:52,000
they're going to be here for for kind of

502
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:53,619
a while and so gear up for that little

503
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,230
thrift store tea cups with succulents in

504
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:58,869
it this costs so little to do and this

505
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,200
is so much basically if you have someone

506
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:03,219
who comes in and they want succulents

507
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,630
there's a good chance that this is what

508
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,190
they wanted to make with it but if

509
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,140
you're already offering it they'll take

510
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:13,720
that shortcut but you have to have it

511
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:17,080
for them to buy it here's a happy spring

512
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,929
thing for kids to appreciate so this was

513
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,519
pretty for all of us but this is the

514
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,788
kind of place that if I took my daughter

515
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:28,058
who's six to a garden center and she

516
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:29,379
would then recall that experience would

517
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,418
be like hey mom let's go to the place

518
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,190
with the rain boots outside does this

519
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,020
make sense

520
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,940
it's something that even kids would find

521
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,879
whimsical and interesting not just

522
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,038
adults and we all have the piles of

523
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,659
stinky boots so it's not like that would

524
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:45,038
cost anything either you've been wanting

525
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,230
to throw those boots away for at least

526
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,158
four years so just hang them from the

527
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,159
fence and plant them up

528
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:59,210
it's I like rough rust and I we go way

529
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,860
back so here's something interesting

530
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,298
adding a little bit of whimsy how much

531
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:06,859
would it cost to French braid some

532
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:08,720
Miscanthus nothing and why didn't you

533
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:11,869
guys already think of this I mean really

534
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,240
where's your head at we couldn't be

535
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:16,219
French braiding Miscanthus I have in

536
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,808
before I never thought of this but I did

537
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,829
buy cheap clips that looks like hair

538
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:24,109
bows and I put them in Miscanthus to try

539
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:25,879
to get my daughter to play with grasses

540
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,349
I don't know why I wanted to do that she

541
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,270
makes it her time machine she steps into

542
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:34,759
the Miscanthus and she says coming out

543
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:36,019
in a different time and she we can all

544
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,548
be adding a little bit of whimsy and

545
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:43,158
this really is going to hook in these

546
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:45,679
generators are called Generation V the

547
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,750
youngest kids I think we may have it was

548
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,009
the baby boomers and we've gone right to

549
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:54,400
Millennials we never really got

550
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:54,400
Generation X our chance hmm

551
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,640
and and really digging into Generation Z

552
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:04,129
is going to be where we need to be we

553
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,288
need to take the lesson of completely

554
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,850
forgetting about X and already start

555
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:09,740
focusing on Z and welcoming them into

556
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:12,109
garden centers creating a little bit of

557
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,679
whimsy play spaces V is young right

558
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:19,369
they're 20 and younger so we need to to

559
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:23,390
really open up fun spots for them one

560
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:25,459
way you can do that for free is to let

561
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,190
the kids paint a rock while their mom or

562
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,569
dad shop met Rock lives in the garden

563
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,400
center you think that kids going to want

564
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:32,839
to come back and visit that rock you

565
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,250
think you're going to hear hey mom I

566
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:36,529
want to go to the place and visit my

567
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,730
rock oh yes that kid is going to want to

568
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:41,710
visit their rocks so you're going to

569
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:46,058
have our return visit right then there

570
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:48,700
you can let kids paint on a fence and

571
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:50,808
like in Chicago we have a lot of

572
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,100
restaurants that encourage graffiti it

573
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:54,589
could be that kind of thing the graffiti

574
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,418
becomes once it gets layered up to you

575
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:59,119
know a couple summers of it it becomes

576
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:01,429
with some kind of weird art so you can

577
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,528
let kids paint their own faces on on

578
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,969
fence posts while the parent shop

579
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:08,919
you can have a little obstacle course

580
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:11,048
from the crawl-through kids garden you

581
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,940
can show parents exactly how to do a

582
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:16,088
kid's garden how to make it fun how to

583
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,519
get kids involved in gardening and this

584
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,568
way you can sell a lot of those little

585
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:24,729
plastic shovel with butterflies on it

586
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:26,440
too I think that they might be the

587
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:29,558
easiest to reach and they're right now

588
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,479
they're the most loyal my daughter has

589
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,178
such a fun time when we go to Ikea she

590
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:35,649
asks to go to Ikea all the time we could

591
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,909
be doing that at garden centers garden

592
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:39,158
centers are a heck of a lot more fun

593
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,049
than IKEA I mean really almost anything

594
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:44,199
is except the Swedish meatballs are

595
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:45,818
really on point we can be creating that

596
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:48,788
kind of fun very easily this is just a

597
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:52,838
pile of dirt for kids to play with how

598
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:55,179
hard was it for us I mean really your

599
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:56,940
kids have some dirt to play with okay I

600
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:00,489
want to come back to the rest of my life

601
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,249
in autumn we have a hard time

602
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:04,899
merchandising those pumpkins so why not

603
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:07,389
make a little labyrinth for kids to walk

604
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:09,428
through it would cost nothing to do this

605
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:11,108
this is just layout I love doing this

606
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:13,479
with mown grass too if you have a lot of

607
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:15,398
a few of a field let the field grow for

608
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:17,259
two weeks and then mow a labyrinth in

609
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:19,988
the grass and that's a great way to keep

610
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,489
kids busy and excited and create an

611
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:25,598
experience that they're going to want to

612
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:27,940
recapture fairy gardens are so not my

613
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:29,138
favorite thing they're not I wish that

614
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,528
they would go away but they're not going

615
00:25:29,138 --> 00:25:34,328
to this is well done this is really

616
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:36,190
great things that need to be

617
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:38,378
reupholstered are next to free on

618
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,568
Craigslist or in junkyards or first

619
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:42,158
doors and this could be very easily

620
00:25:40,568 --> 00:25:44,048
replicated this is really not a big deal

621
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,179
it looks like a big deal really isn't a

622
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:50,949
big deal how to best be part of your

623
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:54,699
community make sure that you're offering

624
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:56,919
classes this is a real thing this is

625
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:59,318
what is called silks it's a big deal I

626
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,229
don't know if every greenhouse can

627
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:05,499
support you know a group of 15 people

628
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:08,588
doing this um no but you could be doing

629
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:09,969
yoga easily especially in the winter if

630
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,339
you're already heating those greenhouses

631
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,590
anyways

632
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:16,319
you could actually have people coming in

633
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:17,730
and having our yoga and then maybe they

634
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,599
buy a plan on their way out maybe they

635
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:24,150
don't painting classes are awful but

636
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,669
they come with is lots of wine and a

637
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:31,380
liquored up customer is always a

638
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:34,529
customer with an open purse I strongly

639
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,470
recommend that plants and wine they go

640
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:40,529
together these starting classes have

641
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:43,650
been a really big deal in early spring

642
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:45,960
the important thing is that as we all

643
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,580
know people want to start their seeds in

644
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,740
January when it's way too early to start

645
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,769
their seeds so you need to be setting

646
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,180
some pretty strong messages in January

647
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:55,799
that yes we have a seed starting class

648
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,259
in March when you're supposed to be

649
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,990
doing it pruning classes have been a big

650
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,339
deal fancy cocktails like growing lemon

651
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,200
verbena for cocktails and here's what

652
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:07,199
you do would have been very popular

653
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,880
canning and preserving is a huge deal

654
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,490
and if you sell canning and preserving

655
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,620
stuff it's just perfect actual gardening

656
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,880
classes I don't know kind of pass a

657
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:20,399
knitting you could just sit around in it

658
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,380
have a knitting circle come and sit in

659
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,630
your greenhouse or a garden center and

660
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:29,370
book clubs book clubs also come with

661
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:32,250
wine that's the deal make sure if you

662
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:34,679
can do events it's a lot of money in

663
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,819
events people keep getting married

664
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,549
what's up with that

665
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:41,759
and there's money in it it's just it's

666
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:44,309
just people open their pockets and they

667
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,440
just start throwing around when when

668
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:48,269
you're getting married weddings parties

669
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,920
charity fundraisers meeting space

670
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:51,299
especially for garden clubs I know a lot

671
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,039
of garden clubs are always looking for

672
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:58,859
space moms night out is this thing where

673
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,799
they each each mom and the group has to

674
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:04,559
take a different night in the month and

675
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,700
they they try to up the other mom and it

676
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,309
ends up where they're renting out the

677
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,259
entire garden centers and doing planted

678
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:13,339
container parties and this is the real

679
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:16,140
thing and you don't charge them much

680
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:18,240
other than enough to keep the place open

681
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,180
and then give them a little discount on

682
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,470
the plants in the past and you have

683
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,720
guaranteed

684
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,019
or 20 sales that night it's not such a

685
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:33,808
bad way to stay open straw bales are

686
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:36,720
great for everything this is a wedding

687
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:41,250
at a garden center can you identify the

688
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,350
actual garden center in there the main

689
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,019
point is that you and your staff are

690
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:48,449
having fun the customers will feel it

691
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:50,849
and it's it's important that it doesn't

692
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,379
become drudgery especially when it's 98

693
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:54,178
degrees out and you just got to get that

694
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:55,199
stuff watered eight times and every time

695
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,580
you pick up the hose someone's like

696
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,710
excuse me where's the geraniums and

697
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:04,168
spikes you still have to make it fun and

698
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:07,019
I recommend that these would help if you

699
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:09,470
could get one of these for everybody on

700
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:09,470
your staff

701
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:18,470
it's the most truthy gardening shirt

702
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:21,410
ever yeah so that's it

703
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:32,539
Cuban question you just like where's

704
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:34,279
lunch right questions were discussing

705
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:37,909
height or you if you want to yell at me

706
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:39,529
and tell me I'm wrong I can't tell you

707
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,990
about it I may have told you about it

708
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,430
under the duress of some sangria sir but

709
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,990
I am not allowed to talk about my new

710
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,750
book I can talk about the old book but

711
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,059
everyone calling on campus I can tell

712
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:54,650
you what's old book the old book is it

713
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:55,299
was it's a at new home Wow there it is

714
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,410
right there

715
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:59,629
yes exactly what it looks like it's

716
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,570
aimed towards new homeowners who they

717
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,620
buy a house and they have this existing

718
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:07,149
landscaping that just isn't their taste

719
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:09,289
and it's a graphic guide so it's the the

720
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,630
illustrations are very trippy and a

721
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:13,159
little bit psychedelic and odd there's

722
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,140
not a lot of text in it at the end of

723
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,730
each page you choose you choose your own

724
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,200
adventure so you don't have to read the

725
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,750
whole book you can just read the parts

726
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,789
you want it is a very weird book with at

727
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,700
least five references the Beastie Boys

728
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:27,759
six references the spinal tap and two

729
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:32,720
references to Star Wars just like this

730
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,859
this presentation so yeah and I'm

731
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,390
working on a second book but I'm not

732
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:38,000
allowed to talk about it unless I've had

733
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:41,770
sangria and if you don't have sangria

734
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,769
with you you have some

735
00:30:43,339 --> 00:31:05,449
I might abandon it yes sir yes why why

736
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:09,559

754
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,560
this sort of thing and kind of see some

755
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,410
of the things they're doing let's see if

756
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:05,539
we can find a little someone who's doing

757
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:10,300
a little bit racier things here you know

758
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:10,299
what I'll do I will do a search here

759
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:24,950
I don't know so Instagram is you just

760
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,778
photos and you post something like a

761
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,610
sale here like look at this great thing

762
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,798
it gives you every all the information

763
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:33,918
you need there in the photo and then on

764
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,450
the bottom right here it gives you all

765
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,070
their information that you need to know

766
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,569
they didn't use any hashtags if your

767
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:41,210
hashtags phobic I know some people just

768
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:43,278
are like hashtags are stupid they're not

769
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,319
stupid they have a really great function

770
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,210
which is they create a live link to

771
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,240
anything else in that area so if you

772
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,710
don't at least use your towns name

773
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,929
that's I mean that's the least thing you

774
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,369
could do if I take pictures at a garden

775
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,230
center I use the hashtag independent

776
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:58,970
garden centers and garden centers which

777
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,440
means you click on that you can see

778
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,450
pictures of independent garden centers

779
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,769

804
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,819
address and town is important the

805
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,829
address in town is important but it's

806
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:05,298
not rocket science it doesn't have to be

807

the most creative thing in the world it

808
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:08,898

garden center is about give a little

810
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:13,009
flavor of where you are and you need to

811
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,720
try to speak out other people in your

812
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:21,700
area and follow them and they'll usually

813
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:21,699
follow you back anything else

814
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:33,338
questions the comments are my favorite

815
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:35,559
part you guys so listening yes sir I

816
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:37,328
don't I don't I I'm not sure

817
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:39,128
because Terry Gardens is going to stick

818
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:41,169
around for a long time and it's just so

819
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:42,940
cheap and plasticky and I would like it

820
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:47,588
I would like fairy gardening to be a

821
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,418
little bit more authentic or how can you

822
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:51,338
have an authentic fairy garden I would

823
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:56,559
be then insinuating that fairies are not

824
00:34:51,338 --> 00:35:00,039
real I was like I was like stormtrooper

825
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,779
gardening to come in I would like a you

826
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,630
know hole to build a Death Star out of

827
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,530
begonias and blow it up I mean I would

828
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:10,838
just like it to be more fun and less

829
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,519
cheesy so I don't I it's nothing I have

830
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:14,108
a problem with the idea of fairy

831
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,150
gardening I have the real problem with

832
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:17,619
the way it played out was there another

833
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:29,789
question because I love questions so

834
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:29,789
much yes that's my job

835
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:39,400
right and my my first garden center boss

836
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:40,810
is my best friend's mom okay so I she's

837
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,088
taught me everything I know just her

838
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:45,730
daughter my best friend garden she does

839
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:47,559
her pot she knows what she likes she has

840
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,940
a lot of knowledge from being exposed to

841
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:54,818
it but she is not interested so I have a

842
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,409
daughter who knows six years old the

843
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:57,639
name of all the plants and stuff so

844
00:35:56,409 --> 00:36:01,500
let's see a ball

845
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:10,589
Thanks we'll see yes

846
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:12,000
yeah well I mean it depends on if you

847
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,490
I wasn't saying depends but if you like

848
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,469
your if you like your landscaping you

849
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:18,199
don't I was like cut down the burning

850
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:21,569
bush

851
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:25,339
kill it with fire and also douse that

852
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,340
gasoline on it all those three things

853
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:31,380
it's bigger than that I would say I mean

854
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,319
I'm a huge core aeration believer I mess

855
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,000
usually most people I talk to they worry

856
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,519
too much about their lawn they want a

857
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,340
perfect lawn and I slapped them twice

858
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,050
once this way and once that way and tell

859
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,769
them the snap out of it and I give them

860
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:51,000
a long rant about about lawns and who

861
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:52,800
are they really supporting and after my

862
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,570
rant is over I can then like what you

863
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,340
can cor aerate it's a pretty good way to

864
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:01,710
get moist down to the roots and you also

865
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:04,108
like I'm a big big fan of that I would

866
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,800
talk to someone about making sure red

867
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:10,980
mulch doesn't ever taint your property

868
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,490
and I would I would talk about growing

869
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:17,519
food because it's such a rewarding thing

870
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:19,588
it's like when you start harvesting it's

871
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,619
like winning this personal lottery in

872
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:24,380
your mind every day right if we can get

873
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,869
young gardeners to feel that feeling

874
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,740
well we'll really we can trick them we

875
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,670
can trick them the rest of the way

876
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:35,848
before you know it they'll be buying

877
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:39,900
paper bark birches yes what isn't in my

878
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:42,390
front yard I'm tearing out the turf in

879
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,588
my front yard and putting in a a big

880
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:45,179
drifts of perennials I have a

881
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:48,690
mid-century modern ranch so I'm trying

882
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:50,069
to keep it kind of modern looking I try

883
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,400
to keep it a little bit more business in

884
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,809
front and party in the back so I have a

885
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,180
at my front door which is kind of

886
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:58,980
recessed I have this summer theme was a

887
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:01,889
tribute to the Polynesian Resort at Walt

888
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,289
Disney World so it's all tropical plants

889
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:06,449
and there's a mannequin there handing

890
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:08,429
out leis and she's in a tropical dress

891
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:11,399
and that's totally normal right

892
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:13,019
and I have a chair with a pillow with

893
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,740
the Dole Whip on it if you've ever had a

894
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:16,420
Dole Whip you'll be like I will

895
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:20,439
that pillow right have you had a dual

896
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,180
whip no okay all right so the whole

897
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,409
front door is tropical right now and

898
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:29,049
I've got dahlias and tomatoes and coming

899
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:31,329
out of swaths of bronze fennel and

900
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:33,070
perilla it's very weird but I get a lot

901
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,750
of compliments on it it's taken me five

902
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,090
years to do a chunk because I have a six

903
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,789
year old I'm hoping to increase my speed

904
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,769
now that she's six I have a lot more to

905
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:45,730
do the backyard is a lot weirder there's

906
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:49,929
a tattoo Shack a mud laboratory of the

907
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:53,769
pipe organ pipe several old bicycles and

908
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:55,659
a lot of bowling balls a lot of plants

909
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:58,949
you know we've got to balance it off it

910
00:38:55,659 --> 00:39:16,779
can't just be planned that's too easy

911
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:20,069
too easy anything else yes then it's

912
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,070
such a strong statement

913
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:27,949
all right I'm going to tell you what I'm

914
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:31,339
going to tell you why you're wrong and

915
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:39,589
and I backed me up ladies bones eyes for

916
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:45,289
dude you say so Voldemort

917
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:49,910
[Music]

918
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:53,029
I would say that bonsai takes so much

919
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:59,719
care and control and I have I personally

920
00:39:53,030 --> 00:40:01,460
have no time for that and I would say

921
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:19,929
that a lot of women would feel that way

922
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:19,929
too is it controlling yes yes

923
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:32,590
