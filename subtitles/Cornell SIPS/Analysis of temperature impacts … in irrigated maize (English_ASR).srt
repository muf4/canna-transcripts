1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
hey so hi i'm i'm liz um and i think

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,039
susan introduced my my project pretty

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
well i've just been looking at

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,198
temperature impacts and irrigated maize

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,000
and i'll start off by giving you a

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,720
little background so

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,800
maize is the top cereal crop produced on

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,399
a weight basis in the world and it's of

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
critical importance to food security and

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,598
also to

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
energy budgets

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,039
and because of that there's a lot of

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
interest in

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,960
if these cropping systems are going to

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,878
remain as productive as they are today

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
with a changing climate

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,878
there's a lot of local

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
variability and uncertainty

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:45,599
in climate projections but there's

22
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,439
consensus that air temperatures are

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,359
going to increase in the coming century

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,439
and in the past decade

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,079
there's been a number of studies that

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,079
have developed econometric models

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
that are trying to look at these air

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,439
temperature impacts on yields whether we

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,039
can make projections about these

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,960
cropping system yields based on air

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,558
temperature alone

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,920
and some of these some of these studies

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,319
have come up with some pretty startling

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
results that first one by schlanker and

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,959
roberts

36
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,959
showed that

37
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,399
based on a non-linear relationship with

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,399
increasing air temperature and maize

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
yields we could see declines in maze

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,439
yields up to 82 percent

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,399
in the next century because of climate

42
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,359
change

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,840
um

44
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,519
a low bell at all in 2009 showed that

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,079
maze yields have already dropped by 3.8

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,079
percent since 2009 after they adjusted

47
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,280
for a yield trend in their data

48
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,078
um and then ariel ortiz barbara

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
in a recent work that was challenging

50
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,319
the

51
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,599
the validity of using a single climate

52
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,199
um metric to make these projections um

53
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,959
warn that the growing consensus is that

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
climate change impacts will largely be

55
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,959
driven by exposure to heat

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
we also see some

57
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,399
evidence that suggests that this is not

58
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,519
the whole story um

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,079
so

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,840
as you know amis is grown in argentina

61
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,438
ecuador ontario there's a lot of

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
different temperature regimes where

63
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,959
maize is being grown

64
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,200
and

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,560
what constitutes a heat stress threshold

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
in one place doesn't necessarily mean

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,039
it's a heat stress threshold in another

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
place similarly we've seen that

69
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,799
what constitutes a stressful temperature

70
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,719
can change in one location from season

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,719
to season

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,680
and you know so in some ways

73
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,439
the mesa's response to heat represents

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
an acclimation process it's modified by

75
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,400
prior temperature regime

76
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,479
similarly some other studies have come

77
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
out that have shown that how we manage

78
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,878
our maize cropping systems interacts

79
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
with the temperature response as well

80
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,518
and there's been evidence presented that

81
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,799
management can help to

82
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
buffer some of these negative impacts

83
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
from air temperature alone so that we

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
have the ability to adapt

85
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,120
our systems to the temperature and

86
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,598
probably most importantly down here

87
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,920
a recent work by susan ria and stephen

88
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,199
shaw over at suny esf showed that

89
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,598
if you're looking at irrigated maze

90
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,359
cropping systems this apparent response

91
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,158
to temperature just just about

92
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
disappears which suggests that previous

93
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,280
models might have been completing heat

94
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,479
and water stress which are of course

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,318
often related in these systems

96
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,479
so what we were interested in doing is

97
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,238
seeing if this econometric approach can

98
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,280
be used to get at the mechanism of heat

99
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
stress

100
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
in these cropping systems and our

101
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,920
approach to doing this was to break the

102
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
maize growing season down and into

103
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,839
growth development periods which is not

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,879
at all unusual the idea here is

105
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
that

106
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,518
heat stress occurring at different

107
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
points in

108
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
me's growth and development is going to

109
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,039
have a very specific very different

110
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,318
mechanisms that are contributing to that

111
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,359
heat stress response that we're seeing

112
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,719
in yields and that different adaptation

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,720
mechanisms

114
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,080
would be needed to be developed

115
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,680
depending on what that heat stress

116
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
mechanism was

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
we also looked at more than just

118
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
temperature

119
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,878
with a little bit of nuance because

120
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
depending on how you how you break it

121
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,239
down multiple climate variables can come

122
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,079
into play in helping you to determine

123
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,360
exactly what that heat stress mechanism

124
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
is

125
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
another thing that we did and i'm going

126
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,840
to go a little bit more into detail

127
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,280
about this later is we modeled the

128
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,878
duration of our growth development

129
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,759
phases using thermal time instead of

130
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,878
using set intervals for them um

131
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,639
you know the reason here is we're

132
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,679
looking at temperature stress

133
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,959
we're looking at when the temperature

134
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
stress is happening in growth

135
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,319
development if those high temperatures

136
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,680
are

137
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,360
changing the duration of the growth

138
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,120
development periods we'd want to be able

139
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
to capture that as an artifact also

140
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
increased rates of physiological

141
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,439
development have been suggested as a

142
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,800
heat stress mechanism in these so

143
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,399
our objectives

144
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
once again were

145
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,319
to see if we could get at a maze yield

146
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,679
response to high temperature if we were

147
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,519
adjusting for these other confounding

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,519
factors such as management or more

149
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,879
importantly moisture stress

150
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,359
we wanted to see if we could do a

151
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,439
mechanistic analysis of this heat stress

152
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
by looking at the timing of heat stress

153
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,560
during crop development

154
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,879
and we wanted to see if we could

155
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,000
quantify the potential adaptation for

156
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,000
management and genetics

157
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,000
so we were able to do this using like an

158
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,959
econometric model because we had a

159
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,800
really amazing bank of yield data to

160
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,478
work with national corn growers

161
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
association is one of the two largest

162
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,319
maize advocacy organizations in the u.s

163
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,319
and winners of the national corn yield

164
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,000
contest have consistently set world

165
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,800
records for maze yields

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,918
so we had we got historical yield data

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,879
from the national corn growers

168
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:30,000
association we got all contest entries

169
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,918
and we kind of secured a data set where

170
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
management has been optimized you know

171
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,839
the goal of these growers is to get to

172
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,360
that that yield potential the place

173
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,319
where um the only thing that's holding

174
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,879
their yields back our climate and the

175
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,360
potential of the cultivar

176
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,199
we only looked at irrigated classes once

177
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
again we wanted to control for the soil

178
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,879
moisture stress

179
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
we looked at the states of kansas

180
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,800
missouri and nebraska for two reasons we

181
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,799
had a really high density of irrigated

182
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
yields in these states and also

183
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
especially with kansas and missouri

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,918
we're getting some of the highest

185
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,680
temperatures that we're going to get in

186
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,599
the corn belt

187
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,038
we looked from the years 2005 to 2012

188
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
once again for a few reasons we had

189
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,399
significant inter-annual variability in

190
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,918
yields

191
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,359
also in climate conditions including

192
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,359
2012

193
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,038
which was a very hot year

194
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,800
and we didn't have any significant yield

195
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,360
trend that needed to be adjusted for

196
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,720
for our climate data we used

197
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
hourly climate

198
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,680
data from the missouri mesonet and the

199
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,519
high plains regional climate center we

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
had access to

201
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,439
almost 70 weather stations in our study

202
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,000
area all this data had been quality

203
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,478
controlled and gap-filled

204
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,319
and we match that climate data to our

205
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,639
yield values based on proximity and also

206
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
similar gdd zone so once again we're

207
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,439
trying to make sure we're getting as

208
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,160
close to accurate temperature conditions

209
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,399
as we could here

210
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
um from there like i had mentioned

211
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,318
before

212
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,600
um

213
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,879
one thing one thing that i forgot to

214
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,960
mention that was pretty important with

215
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,079
the yield contest data i'm just gonna go

216
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,318
back

217
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,560
we have access to we have access to the

218
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
planting date and the cultivar as well

219
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,038
as a whole bunch of other management

220
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,560
parameters so that the management

221
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,439
parameters are important because one of

222
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,000
our research questions were um

223
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,639
you know do we have can we quantify the

224
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
adaptation potential to any temperature

225
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,598
impacts through management the second

226
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,720
thing that's important here is if we

227
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,240
have the planting date and the cultivar

228
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
we can take that planting date to start

229
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
our growing season we can use cults of

230
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,280
our specified gdp to maturity and to

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,080
silking

232
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,399
to model with pretty fine resolution

233
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,839
what our growth development periods were

234
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,279
using thermal time

235
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,478
so

236
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,318
going back to our climate variables

237
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,719
we calculated temperature stress in a

238
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,800
few ways that had been that we found in

239
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
the literature we had hourly data so we

240
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,079
were able to calculate

241
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,839
cumulative degree hours over different

242
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,120
temperature thresholds we looked at

243
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,719
quite a few of them but i'm going to

244
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,879
talk here about 30 degrees and 34

245
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,039
degrees so this is the amount of time

246
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,520
that the crop spent in a temperature

247
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,839
stress condition we also have with those

248
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,799
variables a zero stress situation where

249
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,038
there was

250
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
where we had no temperatures above that

251
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,279
that threshold

252
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,039
we use kdd so kdd stands for killing

253
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,198
degree days it's often called extreme

254
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,478
degree days too in the literature this

255
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
is the same thing as a normal growing

256
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,639
degree day calculation except for you're

257
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
setting your base temperature at what

258
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,439
you would consider your temperature

259
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,639
stress threshold and there's no upper

260
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,399
limit so

261
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,478
that's cumulative degree days where

262
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,240
daily t max was over 29 degrees c

263
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,439
because that's once again the value

264
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,639
that's most often being used in the

265
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,839
literature

266
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,879
we also looked at average night

267
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
temperature

268
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,879
which is pretty self-explanatory and

269
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,039
cumulative solar radiation and then for

270
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,039
for each yield value we calculated this

271
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,278
over the growing season and also during

272
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,879
growth development periods once again

273
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,000
all of those durations were modeled

274
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,759
using thermal time

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,879
um because we wanted to be able to

276
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,000
quantify

277
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,679
um

278
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
i guess the magnitude of yield response

279
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,439
from climate impacts relative to other

280
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,879
variables that we had access to in the

281
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
status set

282
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,200
we used a mixed effects model

283
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,518
for fixed effects we use planting rate

284
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,959
plant and date cultivar gdd maturity and

285
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,080
previous crop

286
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,759
those were in the model because they

287
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
were the most significant

288
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,600
we had random effects for cultivars so

289
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,039
that would be genetic variation that's

290
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,200
not due to the maturity class location

291
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,639
once again pretty self-explanatory if

292
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,720
there's um

293
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,879
yeah if there's any location-based

294
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
trends in our yields farm id nested in

295
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,720
location that lets us look at the

296
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
difference between farm a and farm b

297
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
that are in close proximity to each

298
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
other so that would be management level

299
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
differences that we can't get at with

300
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,079
our data soils

301
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,759
and then we also looked at year planting

302
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
because

303
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,958
we're specifically interested in seeing

304
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,959
if we can explain any of the

305
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,039
intra-annual yield variability

306
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,000
variability that we know is in our data

307
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,519
using climate variables

308
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
after we built this base model our

309
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,799
climate variables were tested as fixed

310
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,879
effects and then once again we could get

311
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,199
the relative magnitude of yield response

312
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,799
out of that

313
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,000
so first most of the most of the most of

314
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,359
the studies that we're following up on

315
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,759
looked at the accumulation of heat

316
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
stress over the entire growing season

317
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,519
when we did that with our irrigated

318
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
yields we saw that none of our daytime

319
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,360
temperature stress indices were

320
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,879
significantly related to yields

321
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,200
which was a little bit of a surprising

322
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:29,120
result radiation as you'd expect

323
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
in irrigated maze under optimum

324
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
management was significant related to

325
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,919
yields and average night temperature was

326
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
also significantly related to yields

327
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,120
when you look at

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
these yield responses on a standardized

329
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,799
scale so change in standard deviations

330
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,879
of predictor variable per change in

331
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,799
standard deviations in yield they're

332
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,759
about equal in magnitude

333
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,679
and inverse of each other

334
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,120
so we see that night temperature has an

335
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,199
impact

336
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
can we get at the mechanism for mule

337
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
decline due to high night temperatures

338
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,879
so going back before we did model the

339
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
duration of our growing season using

340
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,799
thermal time we were trying to get at a

341
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,320
potential heat stress mechanism which is

342
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,599
accelerated rates of phenological

343
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
development

344
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,480
by doing it that way

345
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,679
there's two kind of

346
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,039
conflicting schools have thought about

347
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,599
why night temperatures would impact

348
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,278
yields one is that increased night

349
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
temperatures leads to night respiration

350
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,679
and the other

351
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,879
is that increased night temperatures

352
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,399
increase

353
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,078
development rates so you would just like

354
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,919
i spoke about end up with less

355
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,120
intercepted radiation per unit thermal

356
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:33,039
time over the life of your plant

357
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,039
because we modeled our growth periods

358
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,838
using thermal time and we calculated our

359
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,159
radiation variable by those by that

360
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,200
model we've kind of already captured

361
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,399
that

362
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
we've kind of already captured the

363
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,759
accelerated phenological development

364
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,440
with radiation as the variable that

365
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,958
would define it so what we're looking

366
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,680
for here is an impact of night

367
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,759
temperature independent of radiation

368
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,519
and we didn't see one so

369
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,679
as far as we can tell with our data set

370
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,159
and our method of analysis we're not

371
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,519
seeing an impact of

372
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,399
i guess um

373
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,240
of night respiration but

374
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,000
our our data seems to support the fact

375
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,278
that the impact of night temperatures is

376
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,200
increased rates of development so we'll

377
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,078
we'll go from there

378
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
um

379
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,838
once again radiation was the most yield

380
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
limiting climate variable this just kind

381
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
of illustrates that point with this data

382
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,159
um

383
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,600
the graph on the left shows our yields

384
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,360
in blue

385
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,920
by year and then our distribution of

386
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,278
radiation is shown in pink also by year

387
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,879
and as you can see they kind of they

388
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,439
track each other somewhat

389
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,200
somewhat nicely there um

390
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
the graph on the right is the same thing

391
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
yields in blue but the distribution of

392
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,519
our high temperatures are illustrated in

393
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,320
pink and you see like in 2009 low

394
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,519
temperatures high yields 2012 where we

395
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
actually had our highest yields in the

396
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,078
corn in the um

397
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,240
the yield contest data set was actually

398
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,958
also the hottest year in our record

399
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,839
so we know that radiation is

400
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,518
um

401
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,959
has the most explanatory power of any of

402
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
our climate variables we also know that

403
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,479
it's correlated with high temperatures

404
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,319
the next question is could the positive

405
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
yield response from radiation be masking

406
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,079
any impact of high temperatures when we

407
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440
moved into our growth development phase

408
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,359
analysis

409
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,480
we decided to look at radiation and high

410
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
temperature at the same time in the

411
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,959
model

412
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
we also picked tt34

413
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,440
because when we were modeling our

414
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,160
thermal time we had a cut off on our gdd

415
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,760
of 34 degrees and so hopefully this

416
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,120
would be getting at temperatures that we

417
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,720
haven't already accounted for by

418
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,919
increasing the rates of development

419
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,600
there

420
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,199
when you look when you do account for

421
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
radiation the model night daytime

422
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,839
temperature does become significant but

423
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
it does so in kind of an odd way um

424
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,480
during during early growth right here

425
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,480
you see that t234 and grainfield teeth

426
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,399
or early growth and grain fill high

427
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
temperatures have a slight negative

428
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
association with yields

429
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,399
but these came into the model as being

430
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,159
significant with a frost effect so

431
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,480
pretty much we saw that early growth

432
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,278
radiation modifies

433
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,639
yield response to high temperatures that

434
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,078
are happening during

435
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,759
grain fill and i just said that wrong

436
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,078
early growth exposure to stressful

437
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,439
temperatures gives us a positive

438
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,638
response to those same stressful

439
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
temperatures that they happen again

440
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
during grain film so if you didn't your

441
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,399
crop wasn't exposed to any high

442
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,839
temperatures in the spring

443
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
a big heat wave comes around during

444
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,760
grain fill you'll see a yield decline um

445
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,799
as long as you've had consistently high

446
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,399
temperatures you actually get the

447
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,639
opposite effect it seems to be

448
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
beneficial for yields so a modification

449
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,159
there may be of what's constituting a

450
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,278
stressful temperature the other thing

451
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,360
that you see is that radiation remains

452
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,439
significant we see a positive estimate

453
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
here so this these regression estimates

454
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,360
that's just um the change in standard

455
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,919
deviations of yield that would happen

456
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,399
with one of those predictor variables

457
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,439
but you also see that high

458
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,839
grainfield tt34 during um

459
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,079
high well high tt-34 during grain fill

460
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
negatively modifies the positive yield

461
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,759
response you get from increasing

462
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:55,759
radiation

463
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,919
even though we had significant climate

464
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,159
effects these climate effects are only

465
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,240
explaining a very very small amount of

466
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,039
the total yield variance that we had in

467
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
our data so this right here

468
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,360
is just yield variance explained by

469
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,198
model effect all of our random effects

470
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,560
are in purple our fixed effects are in

471
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,479
green and radiation and tt34 so all of

472
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,078
our significant climate effects land

473
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
about here they only explain just under

474
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,799
six percent of the total variance in the

475
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,839
data set

476
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,838
to contrast that like genetics which you

477
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,519
can find in this pool right here other

478
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
genetics and also a cult of our gdp to

479
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,639
maturity so maturity class and then

480
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
everything that's left over that

481
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
explains yields besides maturity class

482
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,159
explained more

483
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,320
yield variance than our climate

484
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,240
variables did planting rate and planting

485
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,079
date explained more yield variance than

486
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,919
our climate variables did

487
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,159
putting these climate variables into the

488
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,159
model only explained about 15 percent of

489
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,600
our inter-annual yield anomaly so we

490
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,399
still have a whole lot of inter-annual

491
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
variance in our year in our yields

492
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,078
and then what i want to point out right

493
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,159
here is the farm level variance so the

494
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,159
difference between farm a and farm b

495
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,039
that are neighbors to each other

496
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,799
is a pretty significant pool of our

497
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,399
of our variance here and then the

498
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,958
residual error this is just like the

499
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,360
traditional error term that you'd see

500
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,198
in any linear model with just over 30 of

501
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,120
the total variance in the in the data

502
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,120
set so it's also noisy data

503
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,159
so you'll notice when i was looking at

504
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,519
the regression coefficients before

505
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,120
i didn't point out that there was a

506
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,078
significant temperature impact during

507
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,000
silking which is when at least i was

508
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,838
expecting to see the strongest

509
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,198
temperature impact

510
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,360
and overall when you look at the entire

511
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,439
the entire population of cultivars

512
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,039
that's true there was no significant

513
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
impact of high temperatures during

514
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:49,120
soaking on yields

515
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,720
we broke our data set down to include

516
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
only cultivars that had been represented

517
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,079
by more than 10 year yield variables and

518
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,440
then we test them to see

519
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,758
if there was any significant cost

520
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
effects between those cultivars and the

521
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
temperature stress indices so

522
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
do any cultivars have a unique

523
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,359
relationship with temperature stress and

524
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,639
we saw that yes they do

525
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,159
not very many of them but there was a

526
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,799
handful of cultivars that did appear to

527
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,558
be sensitive to high temperatures

528
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,199
during the sensitive period

529
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,519
as we defined it but that with these

530
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,959
cultivars that were sensitive we saw the

531
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,959
most variability and cultivar

532
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,160
performance only under the no stress

533
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,038
condition

534
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,959
so

535
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,720
the cultivars that were

536
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,720
significantly impacted by temperatures

537
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
during the sensitive period

538
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,279
they performed about as well as

539
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
everybody else under really stressful

540
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,399
conditions but they were the ones that

541
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,759
were over yielding the rest of the pack

542
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,759
under non-stress conditions

543
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,200
creating this model that looks at

544
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,599
cultivar as a fixed effect it does not

545
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,759
significantly improve

546
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,519
our understanding of the temperature

547
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,798
impacts over our model that has it as a

548
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,480
fixed effect

549
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,000
based on our model selection process so

550
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,919
i just just note that this is just more

551
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,919
anecdotal and it suggests that maybe

552
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,759
if there are still temperature sensitive

553
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,359
cultivars out there

554
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,519
that could be taken into account you

555
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,199
know as part of adaptation mechanisms

556
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,558
there

557
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,200
then the last thing that we wanted to

558
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,440
see was um

559
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,319
by altering our management practices can

560
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,759
we adapt to our temperature stress

561
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,798
indices as we saw them even though they

562
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,279
were slight

563
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,480
and as far as we can tell the answer is

564
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,519
yes

565
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
so

566
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,759
over here on the left

567
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,480
this is the on your x-axis here you have

568
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,798
early growth tt-34 on the y-axis here

569
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
you have grain field tt-34 and then the

570
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,119
z-axis is yield response

571
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
and this is under average management so

572
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,038
just the mean of everything in our data

573
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
set average cultivar to maturity

574
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,359
gdp to maturity average planting date

575
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,359
average planting rate

576
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,119
if you have no stress

577
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,359
in early growth and then you increase

578
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,199
your stress level during grain fill your

579
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,678
yields decline

580
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,919
high stress during early growth

581
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,798
high stress during grain fill you get a

582
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,520
yield boost go figure um

583
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,119
so and then um same thing over here

584
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,279
except for now we've created a scenario

585
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,119
that we called optimal management so now

586
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,440
we have just slightly increased our

587
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,439
planting date we've slightly decreased

588
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
our planting date

589
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,880
we've chosen a higher

590
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
performing cultivar that performed

591
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,280
across a wide range of climate

592
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,200
conditions it was 33y75 it was

593
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,200
on that other graph it was also a longer

594
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
season cultivar

595
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,519
and we see that

596
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
pretty similarly

597
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,000
no matter what you just want to have

598
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,038
high temperatures early in the spring

599
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,720
which makes sense because we're talking

600
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,919
about an earlier planting date here but

601
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,679
the real thing that i wanted to point

602
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,960
out here is that even slightly

603
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
optimizing from within the range of

604
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,640
current cultural practices you're on a

605
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,200
totally different scale than you'd see

606
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
with your worst case scenario um

607
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,240
you know worst case scenario with

608
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640
slightly optimal management doesn't even

609
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,919
overlap with best case scenario average

610
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,679
management

611
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,080
so

612
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,759
you know this sort of tells us that

613
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,279
within the range of temperature impacts

614
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,400
that we're currently seeing and we did

615
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,399
see some really high temperatures in

616
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,240
this data set

617
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,240
you know maybe the sky isn't falling you

618
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,319
know um

619
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
all right so the conclusions

620
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,159
there's not much evidence of temperature

621
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,280
sensitivity in irrigated maze night

622
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,880
temperature was associated with

623
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,038
decreased radiation and also with

624
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
decreased yields

625
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,919
radiation is the most yield limiting

626
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,279
climate variable that we saw on these

627
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
systems

628
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,960
high temperature reduces the impact from

629
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,319
increased radiation during grain fill so

630
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
we're not getting as much of that yield

631
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,639
boost for more radiation if it's hot

632
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,480
but we also see

633
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,720
that

634
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,960
with our observed temperature impacts we

635
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,480
have evidence of acclimation so prior

636
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,319
temperature regime

637
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,159
experienced by the crop is going to

638
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,480
impact whatever its response is to

639
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
temperatures later on

640
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
climate impacts explain very little

641
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,720
yield variance and can be compensated

642
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,038
for by slightly optimizing management

643
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
and so you know that just kind of brings

644
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,240
me to my final point

645
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
controlling for soil moisture if you're

646
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,798
going to be doing this type of

647
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,639
econometric analysis to make yield

648
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,000
projections in a changing climate

649
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
seems like

650
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,079
it could be of some importance

651
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,559
um

652
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,480
i just want to thank everybody on my on

653

658
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,599
the cornell statistical consulting unit

659
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,038
she's great if anybody hasn't had a

660
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,759
chance to meet her
