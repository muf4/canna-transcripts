00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:12,210
alright good morning everybody welcome

4

to the 6th annual Cornell pioneer

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,570
symposium we're very excited that you

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,199
are out here both in cornell and geneva

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,480
and all across rather if you're on the

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,460
webinar my name is Daniel Sweeney and on

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,519
behalf of the student organizing

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,200
committee for the pioneer symposium and

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,390
synapses for graduate student plant

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,079
breeding organization we're very excited

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,140
to have you here for a seminar today so

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,820
this year our theme is C to start up the

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,219
startup business mentality is broadly

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,170
characterized by small size risk-taking

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,570
and innovative thinking and may be

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,789
beneficial to plant breeding efforts it

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,679
symposium featured speakers addressing

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,109
how small plating companies start and

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,179
find success in a marketplace dominated

22
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,369
by larger breeding companies a large

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,079
breeding companies evaluate acquire and

24
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,609
collaborate with startups and how

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,609
researchers start work and largely

26
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,409
unknown and novel crops I'd also like to

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,269
acknowledge the gracious support of

28
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,030

30
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,510
and also the support of the section of

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,460

32
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,010
and synapses the grad student

33
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,559

and great great great thing to be back

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,829
in in Ithaca it took me some time to get

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,060
here this time but I made it and I'm

42
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:54,179
very glad to be here with you guys and

43
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,129
so I you know as usual to start this I

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,110
you know we try to give a little bit of

45
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:02,129
a reference about what the series is

46
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:05,099
about and why we do it and you know and

47
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,989
you know a little bit of context of

48
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:14,128
where we are going around the world too

49
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:19,979
so see if I can with this one okay sorry

50
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:24,479
I am a fashion so so the series is is

51
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:28,128
you know it's a series that that is a

52
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:31,548
fully student-run the students organized

53
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:34,918
run absolutely all the logistics and

54
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:38,129
manage the budget and make all the

55
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:41,279
decisions around the symposia and the

56
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:44,009
each of each of the university's work on

57
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:45,539
on their own in a way and as much as

58
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,168
possible collaborating with the other

59
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,568
universities around the world but

60
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:54,269
driving their own agenda actually to

61
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:56,778
actually do what is meaningful for them

62
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:00,629
both from the scientific or from

63
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:05,218
educational perspective in in in their

64
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:07,318
own situation for us we think that this

65
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:11,668
is a way to meaningful meaningfully

66
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:14,759
contribute to education because you know

67
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:18,989
some of the skills that the stewards you

68
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:24,090
know learn or acquire during the process

69
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:29,150
our hands-on skills related to you know

70
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:34,799
due to budget management risk management

71
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:36,620
making adequate networking in you know

72
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
with with the scientific community

73
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,859
communication in general there are all

74
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,989
very very important skills that are

75
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:46,079
going to be useful for their future

76
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,808
careers and no matter where wait where

77
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,579
they end on on their career and and I

78
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:53,218
think that that is a major emphasis for

79
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,409
us because the way that we see this is

80
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:59,218
we are helping to we are we are

81
00:03:55,408 --> 00:04:02,399
contributing to build a broader

82
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:05,489
scientific community for for the future

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,069
and another thing is we think that this

84
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,199
is an opportunity for outreach you know

85
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:14,608
not only for Pioneer to actually share

86
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:18,329
what we are doing but for you know for

87
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:22,290
the whole community to actually open it

88
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,740
up to to the public listen to new ideas

89
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:30,639
and discuss in a scientific you know

90
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,288
manner you know relevant topics for

91
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,189
the students and the last one of course

92
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:37,899
is you know while while doing this we we

93
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,490
think that the students are you know

94
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:41,978
have the opportunity to think about

95
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,379
their future career career opportunities

96
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:45,658
discuss about that you know that was

97
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,340
probably the topic of my conversation

98
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:51,879
yesterday with multiple of you that I

99
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:54,459
had had the chance to talk but and I

100
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,158
think that we try to be very open minded

101
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:59,948
on that I mean very clearly making it

102
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:02,740
clear that it is not just about One

103
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:06,550
career opportunity but its broader we

104
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,019
want to promote that idea generally so a

105
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,329
little bit about the history of the

106
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:13,990
series we started in Minnesota 10 you

107
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:16,300
know in 2008 and and we kept doing this

108
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,460
important mending soda continuously and

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,218
this year's going to be the tenth and

110
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:25,418
then consecutive in Minnesota and then

111
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:28,829
you know this was a great idea and it

112
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:31,810
worked very well the students as Mark

113
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,758
always says once you ask the shoes to

114
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:39,430
the gradual to organize something they

115
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:41,348
do a great job right mark and so you

116
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,269
know we took it to marathon as a proof

117
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:45,430
of concept to see what's really going to

118
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:50,139
work and the year after we began

119
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:53,319
expanding around the world and this is

120
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:56,050
where we are this year and I left in the

121
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,968
front the flyer that you can see all the

122
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,770
new universities are added the serum

123
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:02,439
actually I realize now that is not

124
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:05,948
absolutely complete we have at least one

125
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:09,580
more University in the series now but

126
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:12,158
the idea is again you know to build a

127
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:14,228
global forum and as much as possible to

128
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:15,848
take this opportunity you know to

129
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:18,098
everybody that is interested in

130
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:20,500
participating and playing in a way

131
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:25,389
within you know the general rules of

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,569
this series and so we are excited that

133
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:32,168
we have reached this level Daniel was

134
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:37,598
asking me get the world where where when

135
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:40,870
is it gonna stop and I I don't know okay

136
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:43,899
and so you know i mean because there are

137
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,168
you know at the idea is become known by

138
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,728
all

139
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:48,639
people they really want to participate

140
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:51,490
and have the opportunity to you know to

141
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,689
do this on on their own communities too

142
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,060
so we see so but in in the meantime and

143
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,039
while I have you know energy i will i

144
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,740
would i would try to keep it you know to

145
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:05,639
give you the opportunity to as many

146
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,249
people that are interested as possible

147
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,528
so you know at the end of the series

148
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:13,840
this year we we will have more than

149
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:16,990
night we would have had more than 90

150
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,948
events in i think now is it really

151
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,800
around 42 universities and more than

152
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:26,319
15,000 participants in general last year

153
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,228
there was an event in india in which the

154
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,210
total number of participants was more

155
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:33,188
than a thousand and i don't know how

156
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:36,248
they did it honestly I was not really

157
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:39,400
there it will do what a way but it was

158
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:41,259
you know everybody that was there you

159
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,508
know was very excited and it was a great

160
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,740
event for them and a great opportunity

161
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:51,699
for them to bring people from all around

162
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:54,490
the subcontinent to so another thing

163
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,588
that we want to do with this is to you

164
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,649
know to build a forum for participation

165
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:01,930
and you know one thing that we try to do

166
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:05,348
every year and at least once or twice a

167
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:10,538
year is took up other on in-person

168
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:12,728
meeting or you know virtual meeting with

169
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:14,829
as many participants and organizers as

170
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:16,838
possible to make general decisions about

171
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:20,288
the series and which other thing that we

172
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:22,149
need to keep doing and you know to

173
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:25,509
establish the general governance of the

174
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:27,430
series so that you know it doesn't rely

175
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:30,009
on a single person in a way you know and

176
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,019
we shared the decisions among everybody

177
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,509
on and actually you know that were there

178
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:38,500
were a lot of ideas that we had that we

179
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:40,418
tested that we discarded and so it is a

180
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,788
great opportunity for people to think

181
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:44,620
broadly to about the whole series not

182
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,208
just about their own experience that

183
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,019
they manage very well but actually to

184
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:52,039
think and to learn from other people

185
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:54,409
around the world and

186
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,980
and another component I think that it is

187
00:08:54,409 --> 00:09:01,610
very important is the idea of expanding

188
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,339
expanding topics and expanding I opening

189
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,199
up to new ideas and I think that Cornell

190
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,750
has been a testament for that I mean you

191
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:13,338
always bring new things into into the

192
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:15,500
table and i am very us they be very very

193
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,279
proud of that you know of the work that

194
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,990
you guys do and but other places are

195
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,970
actually doing the same we started

196
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,310
originally to be sincere around plant

197
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,750
breeding and a little bit of bias on our

198
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:33,828
side but but we have been expanding

199
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,919
right and we now have symposia that are

200
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:39,620
you know are mainly based on and on a

201
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,620
much more diverse set of topics right i

202
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:48,039
mean you know from pure plant pathology

203
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:52,159
and entomology to genomic engineering

204
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:54,049
and we are even considering working with

205
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,610
some projects that are working on the

206
00:09:54,049 --> 00:10:00,679
interface between engineering and the

207
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,528
plant sciences so that we could actually

208
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:07,239
begin working with a broader community

209
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:09,828
into that space to and bring the idea

210
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,259
and you know i mean expand our

211
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:16,879
connections for the future of plant

212
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:18,740
sciences to so big big things are going

213
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,399
to happen in the near future and I hope

214
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:26,000
that you know we really are able to

215
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,028
expand this even further the other thing

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,708
is you know I always put this is this is

217
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:33,019
an opportunity for communication and

218
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:36,049
some of the universities have been

219
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,519
publishing about this and publishing in

220
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:40,729
the academic community is a very

221
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,220
powerful tool right to communicate and

222
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,860
to systematize and to make things clear

223
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,740
on what are your objectives and you know

224
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,720
these are things are all peer-reviewed

225
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,149
so in a way you know it becomes part of

226
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,060
the larger community by participated in

227
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:59,809
the language and ways of of the

228
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:03,559
community and the last thing is in each

229
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:05,719
of the symposia has their own web page

230
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,638
and we

231
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,730
a centralized web page there is it and

232
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,680
if we have a repository of all the web

233
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,539
pages of the individual symposia and

234
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,778
people can actually go to that

235
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:21,289
centralized web page and you navigate

236
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:23,419
back to the individual web pages to get

237
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:27,019
information and in some cases the

238
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:29,389
webcasts and you know the information

239
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,129
about the speakers organizers and things

240
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,350
like that we are imaginative thinking

241
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,389
about doing some research on all these

242
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,949
data that we have gathered over the gear

243
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:40,278
I mean I think that we have enough

244
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:43,789
replication how 9090 event you actually

245
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:46,659
try to do some data mining and actually

246
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:50,889
try to understand what has happened and

247
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:55,818
with that again thank to synapses and

248
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:59,230
and to the community here in cornell for

249
00:11:55,818 --> 00:12:02,659
for doing this and for keeping keeping

250
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,000
doing this and thank you all for coming

251
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:06,909
here and i hope that we have a great

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,208
event and I'm sure that we will and we

253
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:16,250
will enjoy a great day thank you this

254
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:21,128
has been a production of Cornell
