1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:06,000
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,000
University all right thank you George um

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,959
so yeah I guess I'll jump right into

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,079
George gave a nice introduction um I'll

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,160
jump right into talking about my

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,198
dissertation work I'm studying cardiac

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,399
glycosides in erysimum chy anthes so

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,199
first I want to start pretty broadly um

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,518
talking about how

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,399
plants um avoid being eaten and there

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,600
are uh a number of different strategies

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,878
plants take one of the main ones that

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
people might think about are physical

14
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,320
defenses so things like spines and

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,640
prickles um maybe they have really tough

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,119
leaves that make it difficult uh for an

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,558
insect to eat them but plants are also

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:50,799
really well known for their production

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,519
of chemical defenses um and this is an

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,238
area that's been pretty well studied

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,680
because plants produce just a massive

22
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:58,558
diversity of different compounds that

23
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,600
often have really interesting um

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,759
biological activity so I'm showing two

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,719
examples here um of some compounds that

26
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,759
plants produce that humans are a big fan

27
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,000
of so on the top we have coffee here um

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,079
and this is of course caffeine and then

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,239
on the bottom uh this is tobacco and

30
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,640
nicotine um but in uh the plant that I

31
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,000
study Arison which is a member of the

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,118
mustard family brassey um they produce a

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
group of compounds called glucosinolates

34
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,438
which are some sometimes known as the

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,959
mustard oil bomb um and these are what

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,039
glucos look like when they're intact in

37
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,158
the plant they have variable side chain

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,200
here um of derived from amino acid

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,880
metabolism um in sulfate group and these

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,399
compounds actually are pretty harmless

41
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,959
um as they exist in the plant but then

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,439
the plants also have an enzyme called

43
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,078
morinas which cleaves the sugar and

44
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:55,679
produces this unstable intermediate um

45
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,718
which then degrades into these reactive

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,079
um

47
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:04,478
products that you see here on the right

48
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:07,639
that are ENT um anti-feedant and

49
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,719
anti-pathogenic compounds um and these

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,199
compounds are what give um flavor to a

51
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,280
lot of the plants in this family that we

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,359
eat including things like mustard and

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,919
kale um that give that

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,720
bitterness uh but these compounds have

55
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,000
been around for a really long time it's

56
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,919
thought that they evolved about 90

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,479
million years ago um in this lineage and

58
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,119
that's a lot of time for insects to

59
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,399
adapt to these defenses um there are a

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,200
number of insects that actually seek out

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,480
uh glucosinolate producing plants and

62
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,280
they have a number of strategies for

63
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,598
dealing with um these toxic compounds so

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,439
one of them is the Cabbage butterfly

65
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,399
here which is you commonly see flying

66
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,199
around in the

67
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,879
summer um and they use a redirection

68
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,399
strategy so they have a special um

69
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:55,719
enzyme that redirects the unstable

70
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,080
intermediate to kind of a less toxic bio

71
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,959
product um other insects like the

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,480
Diamond Back moth here use um enzymes to

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,920
modify the glucosinolates before the

74
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,679
sugar is cleaved so they have a

75
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,958
sulfatase that removes the sulfate group

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,439
um and uh preventing the formation of

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,439
the the toxic compounds to start with um

78
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,158
and another strategy is

79
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,199
sequestration which is exemplified by

80
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,919
the Cabbage aphid here um and they're

81
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,759
sometimes known as The Walking mustard

82
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,439
oil bomb because they take the

83
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,798
glucosinolates from the plant and they

84
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,759
store them in their bodies to use them

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
for their own defense

86
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,039
and so in response to this uh herbivore

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,400
pressure uh from these potentially from

88
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,840
these specialist glucosinolate adapted

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,158
insects um some members of the brassic

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,039
casy have evolved new groups of toxic

91
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,519
compounds that can be seen as kind of a

92
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,919
second line of defense against these

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,640
glucosinolate adapted insects so a few

94
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,919
examples of these are garlic mustard

95
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,119
which should be popping up soon around

96
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,438
here all over the place um which makes

97
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
these hydroxy nitr glucosides

98
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:06,039
which kind of gives them the garlicky

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
flavor candy tuft is another example

100
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,280
they make these steroid derived

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,120
compounds called

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,919
cucurbitacin um and finally my study

103
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,720
plan the uh Wallflower or orisome which

104
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,478
makes cardiac glycosides also known as

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,000
cardenolides which I will just splp back

106
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,039
and forth between calling them cardiac

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
Glides and cardenolides because it's

108
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,680
hard to to stick to one um but they are

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,440
steroid derived compound compounds um so

110
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,918
as you can tell because they have this

111
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,719
four um these four fused Rings uh from

112
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,240
the steroid core and then they also have

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,720
this lactone ring up here at the top and

114
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,879
then they're often modified with um

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,560
sugars or hydroxy groups or asil groups

116
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,079
um that might kind of fine-tune and

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,079
change the

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,000
activity and um so as George mentioned

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,840
earlier they have very specific activity

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,399
in animal cells they're Inhibitors of

121
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,599
sodium potassium

122
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,439
atpases which um are critical for

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,120
maintaining uh membrane polarity in

124
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,399
processes like heart function um and for

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,560
that reason they're used in certain

126
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,839
context to to to treat some heart

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,639
conditions but in addition to their um

128
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,478
medical importance they're also of

129
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,879
pretty substantial evolutionary and

130
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,959
ecological interest um they've evolved

131
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,839
repeatedly in a bunch of different plant

132
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,599
lineages some of the ones that people

133
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,918
might have heard of are milked up here

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,879
at the top um with monarchs which are

135
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,799
adapted to cardiac lydes um as well as

136
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,918
Fox Glove down here which is a plant

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,199
you'll find commonly find in gardens and

138
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:51,120
this is the source of the um the

139
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,439
pharmaceutical um where it's purified

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,720
from

141
00:05:52,439 --> 00:06:01,439
today um but I am studying orisome which

142
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:04,400
is up here in the bras Casey um and

143
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,519
uh I my main goals were to understand

144
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,959
the biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides

145
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,359
in this lineage so the biosynthesis is

146
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,918
not known in any of these

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,479
lineages and so what I'm hoping is as we

148
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,359
understand the biosynthetic pathway it

149
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:23,519
can give us some insight both into um

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
how these defensive compounds evolved in

151
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,839
this lineage but also potentially in

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,519
other lineages it seems like it's a

153
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,799
relatively biochemically and

154
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,959
evolutionarily accessible defense since

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,840
it has um convergently evolved so many

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,560
times and also what role uh these

157
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,038
defensive compounds play in a plant that

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,519
is already pretty well defended given

159
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:47,318
that it produces glucose

160
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:49,159
inates and so arism chirines uh has a

161
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,319
number of resources some of which I

162
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,599
developed but actually a lot of them

163
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
were developed before I started I want

164
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,918
to point out to BS zeust who's done a

165
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,279
ton of work um developing arism parentes

166
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,359
as a model um including helping with the

167
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:06,239
the original genome

168
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,199
sequence um and uh also a lot of the the

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,000
resources that I've been able to use

170
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,879
including gene expression from the you

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,560
know 48 different species that George

172
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,080
mentioned um and a transcripton based

173
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,399
philogyny that I used in some of my

174
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:24,519
research and then also M Amai who was a

175
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,560
um former postto in the jander lab and

176
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,159
she collected a lot of the gene

177
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,399
expression data across erysimum chantho

178
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,680
tissues that I used um and really

179
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,279
enabled a lot of This

180
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,079
research um but Aris in particular is a

181
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,439
is a good model um for use in lab it's

182
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,000
small and deployed it's relatively

183
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,918
closely related to the model plant or

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,639
rabid opsis um which so some of the the

185
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,839
resources available in a rapid opsis are

186
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,639
pretty easily transferred to orisome and

187
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,478
we can grow it easily in the the growth

188
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,038
Chambers and Green Houses in the lab um

189
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,639
oh yeah and I was able to develop floral

190
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:01,519
dip stable transformation which really

191
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,400
facilitated characterization of some of

192
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,758
the candidate genes

193
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,359
um that I will discuss later before I

194
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,000
dive into that I do want to go through a

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,000
hypothetical pathway so that we know

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,598
what kinds of enzymes we're looking for

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,598
um and so as I mentioned earlier they

198
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,918
derived from plant steriles I'm showing

199
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,878
here campesterol which is an abundant

200
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,519
sterile in plant membranes um and the

201
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,960
very first step um has for a long time

202
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,120
thought to be the CLE

203
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,679
of this carbon side chain um to produce

204
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,599
the first intermediate in cardiac lco

205
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,639
biosynthesis

206
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,560
prone uh and this enzyme has been known

207
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,439
for a long time in animals it's

208
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:48,159
catalyzed um by a cytochrome

209
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,959
p450 uh but when I started this research

210
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,958
it was not known in Plants

211
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,040
um and the next couple steps involve the

212
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,879
formation of this pregnan scaffold that

213
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,799
cardiac glycosides are built on um and

214
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,480
this involves a series of oxidation

215
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:10,078
reduction and isomerization steps um

216
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,440
these types of reactions are mostly

217
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:14,919
catalyzed by a group of enzymes called

218
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,079
short chain dehydrogenase reductases

219
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,078
they're pretty well characterized in

220
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:21,719
animals less so in Plants um although

221
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,000
there is a substantial amount that is

222
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,000
known so there were some obvious

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,480
candidates going in um the oxidation of

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,120
this hydroxy group to a ketone likely

225
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,159
catalyzed by a three beta hydroxy

226
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,278
steroid

227
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,958
dehydrogenase um the isomerization of

228
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:41,039
this double bond from here to here

229
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,359
likely catalyzed by a three ketosteroid

230
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,439
isomerase in animals these two reactions

231
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,879
would be catalyzed by the same enzyme

232
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,519
it's not clear that that's happening in

233
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,240
Plants um more on that

234
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,078
later uh next the stereo specific

235
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,200
reduction of this double bond um with an

236
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,159
enzyme called a progesterone 5 beta

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,160
reductase um such that this hydrogen is

238
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,639
pointing out of the fa page which is a

239
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:09,600
little hard to see here

240
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:12,559
um and then the reduction of this Ketone

241
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,000
back to a hydroxy group potentially by

242
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,838
the same enzyme that catalyzed this um

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,799
earlier reaction

244
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,079
here next we have a series of two Hydrox

245
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:26,719
Elations um at two specific positions

246
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:31,319
one at this 14 position here and then

247
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,759
another Hydrox silation at this 21

248
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,399
position um and no enzymes when I

249
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,759
started were hypothesized to catalyze

250
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,120
either of these reactions um this 14

251
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,639
beta Hydrox silation in particular is

252
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,240
not a very common position for for

253
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,919
steril to be Hydrox and so that one is

254
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,959
of some

255
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:55,759
interest um finally we need to form the

256
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,159
lactone ring um it's been hypothesized

257
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,838
that this occurs through transfer of a

258
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,759
malinal group

259
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,000
um and then cyclisation which might be

260
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,519
spontaneous or might involve the

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,360
activity of some kind of cyclace and

262
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,720
then we have a bunch of enzymes that are

263
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,800
modifying the end products through

264
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,200
glycosilation Hydrox isolation that sort

265
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,519
of

266
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,759
thing all right so next I'm going to

267
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,560
talk about some of the strategies we

268
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,278
used to identify candidates um for

269
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,078
cardiac lco

270
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,519
biosynthesis and I want to point out

271
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,239
again here to people who did a lot of

272
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,600
this work um um Marty who's here today

273
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,360
and also mia Who collected a lot of the

274
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,000
data and and um did a lot of the work

275
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,399
that my work was built off of um so one

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,519
of the approaches was a philogenetic

277
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,519
approach looking for enzymes or genes

278
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,519
that were duplicated in arism cyanides

279
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,759
it might have been new genetic material

280
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,039
that the plant was able to use um for

281
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,919
this new pathway also looked at

282
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,319
correlation between transcript abundance

283
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,879
and metabolites across a bunch of

284
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,440
different tissues and

285
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,320
treatments um did some Gene coexpression

286
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
so looking for uh gen that are all

287
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,760
expressed together in the same tissues

288
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,838
under the same conditions with the idea

289
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,759
that uh if they're all involved in the

290
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,760
same metabolic pathway it's likely all

291
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:16,600
happening um in the same tissues or

292
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,958
under the same conditions and finally um

293
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,000
mutant screens using chemical

294
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,359
mutagenesis um I again want to point out

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,720
that I did not actually do any of the

296
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,320
mutant screens M Maria did one round of

297
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,360
screens and then Marty did another round

298
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,760
of screens um that resulted in some

299
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,879
really good

300
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,679
candidates and once we had these

301
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,639
candidates uh we characterized them

302
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,399
using a number of different approaches

303
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,039
one was knocking them out using crisper

304
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,679
cast 9 and observing any potential

305
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,319
cardenolide related phenotype um another

306
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,359
one was transient expression in

307
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,040
osiana um to hopefully reassemble the

308
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,240
pathway um either partially or in full

309
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,120
um and also in vitro assays with

310
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,120
purified recombinant enzymes

311
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,600
um and so the gene coexpression

312
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,360
networking was one approach that um was

313
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,360
very fruitful in identifying

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,240
candidates uh so we first tried doing

315
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,199
this across tissues of arism

316
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,600
chantho and um kind of surprisingly we

317
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,639
actually didn't find anything with that

318
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,759
there were no modules of coexpress genes

319
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:27,039
that seemed like they might be involved

320
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,439
in the formation of a steroid like

321
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:33,439
molecule um and so I turned to another

322
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,720
source of variation um that was

323
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,839
available to me which was the the 48

324
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,278
different species of arsum that tis had

325
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,519
worked with that I mentioned earlier

326
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,639
that we had collected RNA seek data for

327
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,039
for the purpose of building the

328
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,159
philogyny but we also had it that and I

329
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,719
was able to use that to build a

330
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,759
coexpression network of genes across the

331
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,680
entire genus or at least the the species

332
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,399
that were included here um and that did

333
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:02,719
yield some pretty good results there was

334
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,759
this module of co-expressed genes um

335
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,600
nine of which were involved in the core

336
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,839
steroid biosynthesis pathway um shown in

337
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,199
blue and then there were a number of

338
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,560
other genes that were good candidates

339
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,719
for involvement in cardiac glycoside

340
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,518
biosynthesis um some of which were

341
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
annotated as being potentially steroid

342
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,000
related but they haven't been

343
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,360
characterized yet um that included a

344
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,519
glycal transferase two cytochrome p450s

345
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,120
um and then two hydroxy steroid

346
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,120
dehydrogenases um and then there were

347
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,159
another there were a number of other

348
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,120
metabolic enzymes that potentially had

349
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:38,240
roles in some of the other steps that I

350
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,679
talked about so one of those cyoc p450s

351
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,879
was CP 87a

352
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:48,758
126 um and when I expressed it in niosi

353
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:51,958
um I observed the formation of this

354
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,560
compound here called prone which

355
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,439
is um the product of the sterile side

356
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,159
chain cleavage that I discussed earlier

357
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,920
um so it seems like this enzyme is Catal

358
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,879
izing this reaction a few other groups

359
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,879
actually simultaneously found the enzyme

360
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,759
from other species um and they did some

361
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,278
more in-depth characterization showing

362
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,839
that those enzymes are capable of using

363
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:15,039
a number of different sterile substrates

364
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,920
including campesterol and cholesterol um

365
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,919
to produce

366
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:22,120
pralo and so I knocked this out um

367
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,198
actually Marty made this knockout um it

368
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,000
was one of the first ones we made in

369
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,919
arism and um in the two independent

370
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,198
knockout lines this is total cardenolide

371
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,719
related Peak area saw pretty much

372
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:38,198
complete knockout of cardiac glycoside

373
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,959
accumulation and because we were

374
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:42,479
perturbing um this one important defense

375
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,359
we wanted to look at the glucosinolates

376
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,000
as well um so we checked those and the

377
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,039
glucosinolates were completely unchanged

378
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,519
so it didn't seem like there was

379
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,078
substantial uh cross talker feedback

380
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,159
going on

381
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:56,078
there um and so this is exciting because

382
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,559
we learned more about the biosynthesis

383
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,719
but this also gives us a really useful

384
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,000
tool for understanding what role uh

385
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,800
these compounds are playing in an

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,278
ecological

387
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:11,919
context and so the first thing I did U

388
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:15,120
was with the help of anoro and Amy um I

389
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:17,278
did a sodium potassium hbas inhibition

390
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,039
assay so as I mentioned earlier um

391
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,318
cardiac glycosides um specifically

392
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,439
Target sodium pottassium atpases and

393
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,799
inhibit them in animal cells so they've

394
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,319
developed a um an invitro assay that

395
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,958
allows us to test plant extracts for how

396
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:35,639
much they inhibit sodium pottassium

397
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,000
hes and so what I'm showing here on the

398
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,799
left are the um inhibition curves from

399
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,399
that with wild type um arism in Black

400
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,838
here um and so farther left is more

401
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,679
inhibitory activity and then as a

402
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,560
cardenolide free control um we used

403
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,519
arabidopsis so in theory we shouldn't

404
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,799
see any any inhibition with that

405
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,039
although at high concentrations of plant

406
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:01,758
extract the um we do see some inhibition

407
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,318
but not exactly sure what's going on

408
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,679
with that but what was clear was that

409
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,798
the two knockout lines in one case it

410
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
was maybe there was maybe some residual

411
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,759
inhibitory activity but for the most

412
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,198
part it was on par with cardenolide free

413
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,000
um

414
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,720
arabidopsis which is exciting um and so

415
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,599
from there I moved on to testing the

416
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:27,160
response of some insect herbivores um

417
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,038
to The Knockout lines compared with uh

418
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,320
wild Ty

419
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,279
and so for these experiments in the lab

420
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,439
I used four different insects two of

421
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,160
them were broad generalists meaning that

422
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,919
they happily feed on a bunch of

423
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,720
different plant species um

424
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,160
and they're likely not specifically

425
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,160
adapted to glucosinolates like I

426
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,880
mentioned earlier and so these two uh

427
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,720
insects were the Cabbage Looper and the

428
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,400
green peach aphid and then I also use

429
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,240
two of The Specialist herbivores that I

430
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,519
talked about earlier that specifically

431
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,880
seek out um plants in the brass of Casey

432
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,759
to feed on and this is the Cabbage

433
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,200
butterfly and the Cabbage

434
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,558
Eid and so for each of these insects I

435
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,480
did two assays uh one of them was a

436
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,279
choice assay where I put them either in

437
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,038
a Petri dish with a wild type leaf and a

438
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,558
mutant leaf and I let them make a choice

439
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,558
about which they preferred to feed on

440
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,798
over the course of you know one or two

441
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,720
days um and then recorded their choice

442
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,558
at the

443
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,360
end uh the exception to this was for the

444
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:33,399
Cabbage butterfly where I

445
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,959
um didn't overos Choice assay I put a

446
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,640
gravid female in a cage with one wild

447
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,480
type one mutant plant and allowed her to

448
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,960
lay eggs on uh the plants and then

449
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,279
counted where she laid the eggs at the

450
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,880
end and then the other kind of assay I

451
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,519
did was a growth assay where I bagged um

452
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,280
insects on to to plants so they were

453
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,079
either restricted only to Wild type or

454
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,079
only to the cardenolide free mutant

455
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:01,240
plants and observed their growth over a

456
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,879
period of a week or

457
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,798
two uh and what I found was that the

458
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,080
generalist insects um in some cases

459
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,639
showed a slight preference for the

460
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,639
mutant lines but in general they were

461
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,080
able to perform at least okay on both

462
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,880
lines so for for the green peach

463
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,519
aphid um there was maybe a slight Trend

464
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,919
that they preferred the mutant lines um

465
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,279
but overall wasn't significant and then

466
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,240
for a colony growth where I just put

467
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,038
five apids on the plants and counted how

468
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,880
many there were after two weeks um there

469
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:33,640
was absolutely no difference between the

470
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,559
two

471
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,200
lines um things were a little more clear

472
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,200
for the Cabbage Looper um so there was a

473
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,480
very clear preference for the

474
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,000
cardenolide free mutant plants if they

475
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,120
were given a choice um but if they were

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,880
restricted to plant um there was maybe a

477
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,038
slight growth Advantage if they didn't

478
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,720
have the cardiac lides um but they were

479
00:19:54,038 --> 00:20:00,640
generally able to perform okay um even

480
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,400
in the presence of cardiac glycosides

481
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,120
oh

482
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,120
those text does not look very good

483
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,119
there

484
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,759
um but uh with the two Specialists they

485
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,000
appeared to be far more impacted by

486
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,119
cardiac

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,839
glycosides and so for

488
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,079
the Cabbage aphid um there was again a

489
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,279
clear preference for the two Mutant

490
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,158
lines and um for Colony growth there was

491
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,359
a very drastic difference

492
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,039
the aphids I put on wild type plants

493
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,678
were not able to reproduce at all most

494
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,359
of them died in a few cases there was

495
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,280
one or two aphids still alive at the end

496
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,279
of the week um but they were able to

497
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,319
happily establish colonies on the the

498
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:47,200
cardenal free mutant lines um saw

499
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:49,678
something similar for the Cabbage

500
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,120
butterfly um where they almost never

501
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,120
laid eggs on the cardolite producing

502
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,678
wild type plants um and they completely

503
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,119
refused to feed even if that was their

504
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:03,038
only option um on the cardal producing

505
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:07,038
plants but they happily began feeding on

506
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,879
the um knockout lines I will not I used

507
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,919
uh refused to feed or began feeding

508
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,000
because most of them did still die on

509
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,640
the mutants uh but a few of them reached

510
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,159
pupation and made it to adulthood um so

511
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,799
they were able to complete their life

512
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,278
cycle on on the mutant plants which was

513
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:26,038
exciting um and so I wanted to take this

514
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:28,159
one step further and I planted them out

515
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,000
in the field this past summer I'm not

516
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,200
going to go too much into the design but

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,599
I had wild type plants and um The

518
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,919
Knockout plants in the field I visited a

519
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,480
couple times and just recorded what I

520
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,400
observed on each

521
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,720
plant um and so at the end of the

522
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,519
experiment these are the most common

523
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,480
visitors with the number of observations

524
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,558
at the bottom by far the most common

525
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,120
insect that I saw was this striped flea

526
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,480
Beetle um which is a crucifer specialist

527
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,839
and it did not seem to care at least in

528
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,360
terms of how often it occurred on any

529
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,558
individual plant it didn't seem to care

530
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,639
about cardiac glycosides at

531
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,240
all um and then the turnup aphid which

532
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,840
is another crucifer specialist uh I saw

533
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,200
a lot of them but that's really because

534
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,558
there were a few colonies that were

535
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,919
really quite well established so I can't

536
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,038
really draw any conclusions from that um

537
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,480
I also saw a good number of

538
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,440
snails as well as a lot of spiders um

539
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,640
that were

540
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,038
not eating the plants but they were

541
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,520
building their webs and living uh in the

542
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,119
plants

543
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,158
I also want to give an honorable mention

544
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:37,439
to the wood Shu that managed to just

545
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,080
completely chop down 22 of the

546
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,240
plants uh and they also did not care

547
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,439
about cardiac lydes probably because

548
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,079
they weren't actually even eating it

549
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,798
they were just I don't I honestly don't

550
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,798
know what they're doing

551
00:22:54,319 --> 00:23:00,759
um so but for two of them I did get two

552
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,839
EX in results the Cabbage butterfly like

553
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,679
we saw in lab really doesn't like laying

554
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,319
eggs on cardenal producing plants

555
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,840
because it knows well I don't know if it

556
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,399
knows but it the the larvae won't feed

557
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,439
on it so it's a good idea not to lay

558
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,798
eggs on

559
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,320
them um and then the snails also which I

560
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,079
was not expecting were more commonly

561
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:20,759
observed on The Knockout plants I didn't

562
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,879
do anything like measuring Leaf area

563
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,158
eaten by snails or anything but the fact

564
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,480
that they were um almost twice as likely

565
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,679
to be found on the cardal knockouts

566
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,400
suest that they're doing most of their

567
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,480
feeding um on The Knockout

568
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,880
points all right so that was all I had

569
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,440
on the insect side and so now back to

570
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:47,080
the chemistry and searching for enzymes

571
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,558
that are involved in this pathway um so

572
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,798
I talked before about this scaffold

573
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:55,119
formation step that involves a series of

574
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,759
different enzymes that catalyze Redux

575
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,199
reactions on the steroid core

576
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,759
um and this

577
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,440
isomerization and there were two good

578
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,720
candidates in the co-expression

579
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,759
cluster uh to catalyze these kinds of

580
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,319
reactions the two hydroxy steroid

581
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,879
dehydrogenase uh

582
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,918
genes

583
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,039
and then um there were also some EMS

584
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,640
mutants that showed promise here one

585
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,400
that Marty found one that Mia found um

586
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,159
and

587
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,960
so with those three enzymes uh which are

588
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,520
marked here about whether they were

589
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,558
found from an EMS mutant that's the

590
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,720
chemical uh mutagenesis or the

591
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,759
co-expression cluster in one case the

592
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,000
three beta hydroxy dehydrogenase was

593
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:44,679
found using both um

594
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,200
approaches um but I used inv vitro assay

595
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,720
with purified recombinant enzymes to

596
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,278
confirm that they at least possess the

597
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,640
activity shown here in um in

598
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,440
vitro and so especially with this three

599
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,799
beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase it's

600
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,320
kind of unsurprising that able to

601
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:04,158
catalyze this reaction the the oxidation

602
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,639
of this hydroxy group to a ketone um and

603
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,240
in vitro I did see some apparent

604
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,200
isomerization along with the

605
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,480
oxidation um but at this point I'm it's

606
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,159
not clear to me whether that's happening

607
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,679
spontaneously um or whether that's

608
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,000
actually activity that is catalyzed by

609
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,159
the enzyme so if I feed this ISO

610
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,480
progesterone here to the three beta

611
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,760
hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase I see

612
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,919
really very little isomerization but

613
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:34,038
with this other enzyme three which I am

614
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,679
calling a three ketosteroid isomerase um

615
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:38,200
we see very good isomerization of the

616
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,798
iso progesterone to the progesterone so

617
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,278
it seems like these two enzymes are

618
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,839
working together to produce progesterone

619
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:45,759
which is in contrast to animals where

620
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,000
there's usually a single enzyme that

621
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,839
catalyzes both of these steps um I think

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,558
in bacteria It's also two separate

623
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,798
enzymes kind of interesting there um

624
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,960
there was one report actually of a three

625
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,038
beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase from

626
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,759
plants that is able catalyze both of

627
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,879
these reactions but I'm still not quite

628
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,679
convinced it seems like with um some

629
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,600
potential spontaneous isomerization

630
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,519
there that uh careful attention needs to

631
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,480
be paid to that to to really

632
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,639
definitively talk about that enzymatic

633
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,360
activity and then this progesterone five

634
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,520
beta reductase catalyzes the five beta

635
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:25,639
reduction of progesterone um

636
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,398
unsurprisingly and then the three beta

637
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,120
hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase which is

638
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:31,839
the same enzyme over here at least in

639
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,959
vitro is able to catalyze the reverse

640
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,119
reaction the reduction of this Ketone

641
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,240
back to the hydroxy group um whether or

642
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,519
not that's happening in planta I'm not

643
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,919
sure at this point um there was actually

644
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,639
another enzyme in the co-expression

645
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,559
cluster that caught my eye and this was

646
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,440
a steroid 5 Alpha reductase which

647
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,440
catalyzes the same reaction as the five

648
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,240
beta reductase but with inverted

649
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,880
stereochemistry so you can see the

650
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,640
product of this the hydrogen here is

651
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,120
pointing out of the page and here it's

652
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,759
pointing into the page um and this

653
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:10,519
enzyme is called deated 2 um or de 2 uh

654
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,720
it's fairly well characterized from

655
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,480
arabidopsis because it is involved in

656
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,159
brass steroid biosynthesis um and so

657
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,839
mutants to this enzyme are deficient in

658
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:23,840
brass steroids and they are dphs um and

659
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,918
it seems like this enzyme in addition to

660
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,558
catalyzing the analogous reaction in

661
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,600
brass and steroid biosynthesis is

662
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:32,240
capable of using progesterone as a

663
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,719
substrate um to potentially produce

664
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,519
these five Alpha intermediates which

665
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,960
might lead to the production of

666
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:43,359
um cardiac glycosides with altered

667
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,079
stereochemistry at this position and

668
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:50,079
that might not seem like a big deal but

669
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,798
um if we draw the compounds in kind of a

670
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,119
different way to give you more of an

671
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,720
idea about the 3D structure of the

672
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,119
molecules um it does actually make a

673
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,360
substantial difference in terms of the

674
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:05,319
overall shape of the the cardiac lcoes

675
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:08,439
so in the 5 Alpha configuration here the

676
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,480
fused rings are relatively flat with

677
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,440
each other um whereas with the five beta

678
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,640
cardenolides um there's this kind of

679
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,600
Kink that's introduced um at the final

680
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:25,759
ring so with the knockout mutants we can

681
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:27,038
start to see um that these uh the

682
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,759
presence or absence of some of these

683
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,278
enzymes might be controlling

684
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,960
the overall configuration of the cardiac

685
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,960
glycosides that the plants produce so in

686
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Wild type plants when all the enzymes

687
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,840
that I discussed are present um we see

688
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,278
production of these five beta

689
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,319
cardenolides

690
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:51,240
here which is represented here um with

691
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:54,000
each cardal colorcoded with um as in

692
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,880
terms of the overall Peak area on the

693
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,119
mass

694
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
spec so wild type we pretty much only

695
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,079
see five beta card analyed oh and I have

696
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,199
the little configuration down there to

697
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,960
show you that it is

698
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,720
different um but the pathway mutants we

699
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,120
see the accumulation of atypical

700
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,558
cardenolides that we don't usually see

701
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,959
in Wild type plants so if we knock out

702
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:20,240
the three beta hydroxysteroid

703
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,960
dehydrogen dehydrogenase um we get

704
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,798
these cardiac glycosides that are still

705
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,798
reduced at the same position as this

706
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,759
prone intermediate so it seems like the

707
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,000
pathway enzymes are using intermediate

708
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:34,158
that accumulates in this mutant line to

709
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,278
produce cardiac glycosides with altered

710
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,600
um reduction at the steroid

711
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,359
core we see something pretty similar if

712
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,480
we knock out the ketosteroid

713
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:48,158
isomerase um where we see accumulation

714
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,919
of these Delta 5 cardenolides

715
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,200
um if we knock out the progesterone 5

716
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,919
beta reductase we see a complete loss of

717
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,558
the five beta cardenolides um and the

718
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,320
accumulation of five Alpha cardal with

719
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:05,200
inverted stereochemistry at that

720
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:07,879
position and then if we knock out the

721
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,640
five Alpha reduct a. two we get these

722
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,360
tiny little mutant plants um they're

723
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,240
yeah you can barely even see them here

724
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:20,798
these plants are the same age um

725
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,480
and the Cardinal profile is relatively

726
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,679
unchanged um which is perhaps

727
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,360
unsurprising because we don't usually

728
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,640
see five Alpha cardenolides um in arism

729
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,599
Kor

730
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,720
but if we knock out both d 2 and

731
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:37,278
progesterone 5 vuas we completely lose

732
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,919
or almost completely lose cardiac

733
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,000
glycosides that are fully reduced in

734
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:46,320
their steroid core um and instead end up

735
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,839
with the a mix of Delta four and Delta 5

736
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,079
cardenolides with the double bond at

737
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,558
different positions

738
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,038
there um and

739
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,240
so uh with these mutants it became

740
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,359
obvious that it was relatively easy to

741
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,120
change uh the end products of the

742
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,558
pathway just through the activity of a

743
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,798
single enzyme in the middle of the

744
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:09,200
pathway um and we looked at some of the

745
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:11,879
variation in the sequence and expression

746
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,399
of these enzymes across the genus um and

747
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,799
saw some amount of correlation

748
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:17,599
especially with this progesterone five

749
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,319
beta reductase um in terms of when it's

750
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,480
expressed we get five beta cardenolides

751
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,000
when it's not expressed we do see the

752
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,319
accumulation of some five Alpha

753
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,079
cardenolides in certain species um I

754
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,439
don't have time to go in depth about

755
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,278
that now we did just upload a pre-print

756
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,200
by archive if you are interested in

757
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,880
learning more about

758
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,798
that all

759
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,799
right for the last part of my talk um I

760
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,759
want

761
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:46,839
to discuss the two

762
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,798
hydroxylases that are acting on cardenal

763
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,278
intermediates uh so if we go back to the

764
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:55,278
coexpression cluster one last

765
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:58,200
time uh there are some two oxylate

766
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,638
dioxygenases that were coexpressed with

767
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,159
other cardiac glycoside biosynthesis

768
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:09,439
enzymes um two oxylate dioxygenases are

769
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:14,039
pretty abundant um type of gene in

770
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,320
plants and they uh mostly catalyze the

771
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:19,879
addition of hydroxy group or otherwise

772
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:23,000
oxidized um small molecules and are

773
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:27,399
often involved in specialized metabolic

774
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,720
pathways uh one of them is this aop1

775
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:29,759
like

776
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,038
uh

777
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:36,200
enzyme so aop1 aop means alkenol hydroxy

778
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:39,638
alal producing it's known from

779
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,840
arabidopsis and it the so aop2 aop1 the

780
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:44,719
function actually isn't known but aop2

781
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,319
and aop3 which are closely related um

782
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
are involved in glucosinolate

783
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,720
biosynthesis so it's kind of interesting

784
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,599
that there would be this close relative

785
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,000
of these glucosinolate genes um

786
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:58,319
coexpressed with the um cardiac

787
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,558
glycoside biosynthesis genes and then

788
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,000
not in this iteration of the

789
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,000
co-expression cluster but in a slightly

790
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,038
modified one with different parameters I

791
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,200
also saw another two oxylate

792
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:13,519
dioxygenase um which is a duplicate of

793
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,319
dioxygenase for oxin oxidation one and

794
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,720
this is an enzyme that is involved in

795
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:22,200
oxin homeostasis it oxidatively

796
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,558
deactivates oxin um and there are two

797
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,120
copies in arabidopsis but one of them

798
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:29,278
has been duplicated an additional time

799
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:33,038
in orison and that one is coexpressed

800
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,038
with cardiac glycoside biosynthesis

801
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,239
genes uh so I knocked both of them out

802
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,798
and they both are deficient in cardiac

803
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,319
glycoside biosynthesis which is exciting

804
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:43,638
um suggesting that maybe they're

805
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:48,079
catalyzing these two successive Hydrox

806
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:49,719
Elations um the aop1 like was pretty

807
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,759
much undetectable levels of cardiac

808
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,360
glycosides Dow one like uh I could

809
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,839
detect cardiac gdes but there was about

810
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,079
a hundredfold reduction in total

811
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,398
abundance of the comp

812
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,798
so it's exciting to have these mutants

813
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,319
but what I really want to know is what

814
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:05,960
these enzymes are actually doing so for

815
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,519
one thing what order they're acting in

816
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,119
and for another the position of Hydrox

817
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,838
silation catalyzed by each of these

818
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,879
enzymes um and so the mutants do give a

819
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:16,759
little bit of a clue to that in the aop1

820
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,838
like Knockouts some of these earlier

821
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,599
intermediates in um cardol biosynthesis

822
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:25,000
accumulate to higher levels than we see

823
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,838
in Wild type suggesting that maybe this

824
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,159
one is acting directly on those

825
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:33,078
intermediates and might be the first

826
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,000
hydroxy and then in the Dow one like

827
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,760
Knockouts um we see really high levels

828
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,119
of

829
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,520
accumulation of an

830
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,320
apparently I guess dihydroxy

831
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,480
intermediate suggesting that it might be

832
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,399
the um second enzyme to act in the

833
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,119
pathway and these intermediates are also

834
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,638
glycosilated which is why we see several

835
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,639
different Peaks corresponding um to this

836
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,639
Mass

837
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,200
um another clue that the

838
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,240
um that these mutants can give me is

839
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,000
through feeding up substrates to the

840
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,078
mutants to see if we can restore cardiac

841
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
glycoside

842
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:16,280
biosynthesis um and so most of these

843
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,400
intermediates are not commercially

844
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
available or I wasn't able to find them

845
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,760
but one somewhat similar compound this

846
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,760
21 Hydro hydroxy progesterone was

847
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,240
available um so the only difference

848
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,119
between progesterone here and the 21

849
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,358
hydroxy progesterone is this hydroxy

850
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,838
group here um which is required in

851
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:38,759
cardiac gide biosynthesis so shown here

852
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:42,599
at the bottom um is the wild type um

853
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,960
chromatogram of um a mass that is

854
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,480
commonly associated with a bunch of

855
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,280
different cardiac

856
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,480
glycosides and so I'm kind of using

857
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,680
these Peaks just to show you know we are

858
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,960
seeing the cardal Peaks or we're not and

859
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,519
so in Wild type we see a bunch of

860
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,880
different Peaks um and in the aop1 like

861
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,039
knockouts um whether I feed it

862
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,039
progesterone or 21 Hydro hydroxy

863
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,599
progesterone this was uh infiltration

864
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,599
with a syringe into the leaves um after

865
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,079
24 hours we still don't see any cardiac

866
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,318
glycosides but in the da one like

867
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,280
mutants if I feed progesterone I don't

868
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:18,559
see much of anything but with 21 Hy

869
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,920
hydroxy progesterone we do see those

870
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,759
cardiac glycoside Peaks reappear um so

871
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:30,880
this is pretty decent evidence that the

872
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,880
da one like enzyme is required for 21

873
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,960
Hydrox um I also took these enzymes and

874
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,919
well I expressed them in osiana and

875
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,880
co-infiltrated some substrates to see if

876
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,680
they were active um on the cardolite

877
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,160
intermediates and the aop1 like enzyme I

878
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,318
found readily hydroxylates pretty oh

879
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,960
pretty much any cardenolide intermediate

880
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,400
I'll throw at it it doesn't really seem

881
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,760
to care what's going on down at this

882
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,519
part of the molecule um

883
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,760
and I am showing the hydroxy group at

884
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,559
the 14 position although I don't have

885
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,160
super great evidence that that's what's

886
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,719
happening um in addition to the other

887
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,358
enzyme maybe catalyzing the 21 Hydrox

888
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,480
ilation so by process of elimination

889
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:18,920
this one would be the 14 hydroxy uh this

890
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,760
compound right here has been reported in

891
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,240
some plants just to accumulate to high

892
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,040
levels so in this paniculate swallow

893
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:28,719
wart which is used in Chinese medicine

894
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:33,800
um this compound accumulates and when I

895
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,919
feed aop1 like with prone here I see a

896
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,039
peak with this mass that is also present

897
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,519
in paniculate swallow wart um so that's

898
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,960
maybe some more evidence that it's the

899
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,838
14 hydroxylase um although it would

900
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,599
require additional uh

901
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:54,239
confirmation uh to be really sure about

902
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:58,800
it and then uh if I coexpress both aop1

903
00:37:54,239 --> 00:38:01,559
and DOW one like um and at some of these

904
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,039
intermediates I do see that da one like

905
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:07,759
seems to consume whatever is made by

906
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:10,719
aop1 like uh and

907
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,800
produces new intermediates that don't

908
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,118
have quite the mass that I would expect

909
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,400
for one thing they seem to be

910
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:21,880
glycosilated this is likely happening uh

911
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,240
by um endogenous enzymes in the

912
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,119
kosana uh which is one of the problems

913
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,799
with trying to rebuild the system in N

914
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:32,760
kosana is that we have some potentially

915
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,519
promiscuous activity of nios benthamiana

916
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,760
enzymes um but that's not really what

917
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,639
I'm worried about what I'm more worried

918
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,720
about is that the mass of these

919
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:44,719
compounds actually correlates with the

920
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:46,318
addition of this um potentially an alahh

921
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,838
right there so we're missing two

922
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:50,079
hydrogens compared to what I would have

923
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:53,440
expected if it was a

924
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,039
hydroxy um and so maybe these

925
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,519
intermediates are involved maybe this is

926
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,239
something else weird that's going on in

927
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,119
kosana um I don't know I also don't even

928
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,799
know that these structures are correct

929
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,960
um but it's definitely active um which

930
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,760
is

931
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,639
exciting uh all right so I do now want

932
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,079
to talk more about I think both of these

933
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,679
enzymes are kind of interesting

934
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,119
evolutionary

935
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:20,000
stories in terms of looking at Gene

936
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,599
duplication and how plants evolve new uh

937
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,838
metabolic pathways and so as I mentioned

938
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:29,920
earlier Dow one um there is duplicated

939
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:34,318
an ARIS relative to other related plants

940
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,318
so here we have the rice um Dow as the

941
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:40,679
out group and then these are all a bunch

942
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:43,800
of other brassas so that's chamina utria

943
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,440
Brasa um in general in brassic Casey

944
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,560
there are two main clades Dow one and

945
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,639
DOW two and then in arism there's

946
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,159
seemingly anisum specific duplication

947
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,519
here with uh presumably this 1G

948
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,399
2032 um maintaining the ancestral

949
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,559
function of Dow one in Oxy oxin

950
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,318
homeostasis um and this 1G 20322 which

951
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,400
is the D1 like enzyme that potentially

952
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:11,119
is taken on a new role um and so if we

953
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,960
look at micro syntony between the the

954
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,119
um lowai containing these enzymes in a

955
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,039
rabid opsis here on the top in arism so

956
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,358
in a rabid opsis Dow one and dow2 are a

957
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,880
t duplication and then in orisome um

958
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,920
there's just an additional tandem

959
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,358
duplicate of uh

960
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Dow one that has seemingly taken on a

961
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,078
new role in cardenolide

962
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,358
biosynthesis I'm not showing it here but

963
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,440
um we're working with a collaborator

964
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,519
Cynthia Holland at Williams College who

965
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,519
just right before my seminar sent me

966
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,079
some exciting uh modeling results uh

967
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,719
that are helping us understand which um

968
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,359
changes to to amino acid residues in the

969
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:54,919
active site um might have contributed to

970
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,880
this pretty substantial shift in

971
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,240
substrate preference from this small

972
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,440
oxin molecule here to the larger pregn

973
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:07,919
intermediates in cardiac gly

974
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,519
biosynthesis so aop1 um is a little bit

975
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,039
more complicated in that in

976
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,239
arabidopsis we have aop2 and aop3 which

977
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,920
are involved in glucosinolate

978
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,959
biosynthesis and then aop1 here which

979
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,240
does not have a known function relative

980
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,039
to the one copy of aop1 in arabidopsis

981
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,439
there are five inimum um that are

982
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,000
scattered across

983
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,358
a few different Lite on chromosomes

984
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,119
three and two

985
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:39,598
um and it is this one over here 3G 34150

986
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,838
that seems to have taken on a new role

987
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,240
in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis I also

988
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,880
think some of these other enzymes um I

989
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,719
didn't mention but some of them are also

990
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,680
coexpressed in the in the coexpression

991
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,159
cluster I showed earlier so it seems

992
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,719
like some of them might also be involved

993
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,279
um potentially in modification of

994
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,639
cardiac ldes and I think they're good

995
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,319
candidates for further study

996
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,759
study um and so that also leaves open

997
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:06,239
the question of what about the rest of

998
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,960
the pathway um and the answer is I don't

999
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:12,479
know I cloned a ton of genes and um

1000
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,280
didn't see really any activity in N

1001
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,039
kosana for a lot of them although part

1002
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,680
of this might be the fact that we're

1003
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:22,719
seeing um modification of the

1004
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,879
intermediates in nikosi by endogenous

1005
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,078
enzymes that might be interfering with

1006
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,079
the activity of some of the later

1007
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,960
enzymes

1008
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,480
um there is a asil transfer a malal

1009
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,000
transfer that seems like a really good

1010
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,960
candidate in the co-expression cluster

1011
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,559
but I haven't seen any activity um when

1012
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,679
I've tried to clone it so I don't know

1013
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,319
what's going on there there are also

1014
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,279
some good candidates for glycosilation

1015
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:46,719
and Hydrox silation that I won't discuss

1016
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:51,040
further um so that's all the science I

1017
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:54,279
have but I do want to think uh

1018
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:58,838
acknowledge all my friends

1019
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,960
H who uh really made School great and my

1020
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:03,759
girlfriend who also made grad school

1021
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:08,358
great uh

1022
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,599
and uh also my family Oop There They Are

1023
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:14,199
Who many of whom came to see me

1024
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,720
today um and then also of course all the

1025
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:23,078
people who were involved in my uh

1026
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:25,318
PhD who uh you know taught me different

1027
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,280
techniques advised me in various ways

1028
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:31,838
collaborated on various products

1029
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,559
projects um these five people up here uh

1030
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:37,039
are well Mia I talked about a lot

1031
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:38,839
earlier as as well as Marty um but Toby

1032
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,440
Anamaria and Julia are undergrads who

1033
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,679
worked on arism with me as well and did

1034
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,679
some really great and exciting work um

1035
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,279
and contributed in really important

1036
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,000
ways um also of course want to

1037
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,000
acknowledge my funding sources and my

1038
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,159
committee uh who are always ready with

1039
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,719
good advice um and guidance I'd be happy

1040
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:58,719
to take any questions

1041
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,960
yeah so it like a lot of your insects

1042
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,319
weren't feeding on the with parales on

1043
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,240
them they were choosing not to do you

1044
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:08,759
have any ideas about the mechanisms that

1045
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:14,318
might underly

1046
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:16,079
that like how are they KN yeah um so the

1047
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,800
the Cabbage butterfly in particular are

1048
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,000
interesting because they just as far as

1049
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,559
I can tell when I watched them they

1050
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,358
would land on it and then just fly away

1051
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,160
and they wouldn't it I mean I don't know

1052
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,558
maybe they're scraping their osit on it

1053
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,000
or something um but it seems like yeah

1054
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,359
there there has to be some kind of a

1055
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,199
recognition mechanism even without

1056
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,239
feeding for them so on their tari they

1057
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,679
they probably have some sort of receptor

1058
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,759
and then they are bitter I believe I

1059
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,440
have not tried them um but in terms of I

1060
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,599
I think they they'll feed on it and then

1061
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,720
it it just tastes bad

1062
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:49,359
maybe

1063
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:53,279
yeah

1064
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:56,119
yeah the involvement of dt2

1065
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,519
card I'm wondering if you know or

1066
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:02,680
hypothesize anything about any potential

1067
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:06,480
cross talk between brass and cardiac

1068
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:09,799
cardiac like do you think like if you

1069
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,960
appli you think you've seen induction

1070
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,039
of production

1071
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,079
or yeah I think that's an interesting

1072
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,079
question in particular I mean they're

1073
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,440
using the same precursors as well so you

1074
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,800
can imagine especially in the The

1075
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,599
Knockout lines where were I knocked out

1076
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,400
cardiac gide biosynthesis which was like

1077
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,960
a huge sync for for sterols so maybe the

1078
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,240
accumulation of those might have led to

1079
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,720
differences in brass and steroid

1080
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:34,959
biosynthesis I didn't see anything with

1081
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,919
that and I do know at Cynthia who I

1082
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,960
mentioned earlier did some

1083
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,519
experiments um with growing arism on

1084
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,920
plates with brassin steroids and I don't

1085
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,440
think she saw anything um one

1086
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,559
interesting thing what oh there were

1087
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,760
more of them with the brass steroids so

1088
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:57,319
oh okay cool there you go did you do

1089
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,440
some of those experiments too okay

1090
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:02,239
anyway uh yeah apparently I don't know

1091
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,559
but uh I was going to say something else

1092
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,558
oh yeah another interesting thing so in

1093
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,920
risum chirines there's only the one copy

1094
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:13,760
of Deb 2 which it seemed maybe a little

1095
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,000
surprising that it could be active in

1096
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,800
cardiac gide biosynthesis but then it's

1097
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,800
also involved in in brasin steroid

1098
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,720
biosynthesis um there are other species

1099
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,960
of arism that do produce the five Alpha

1100
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:28,639
cardenolides and I don't know in some of

1101
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,440
those species whether they might have a

1102
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,199
dedicated copy of De 2 that could be you

1103
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,519
know regulated or have different

1104
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,838
activity um compared to the de two

1105
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:42,039
that's involved in brass and Stor bios

1106
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,039
synthesis but yeah a good good

1107
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:50,199
question yeah I guess I was wondering so

1108
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:53,239
um in the plants that make the five

1109
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,399
Alpha card lights or the like Delta four

1110
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:57,399
Delta 5 CES do you do you think that

1111
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,119
those have like different effects on

1112
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,480
sodium potassium etpa or like I guess

1113
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,960
when we were looking at Mia's mutant it

1114
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,440
like it was more toxic to the insects

1115
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,760
despite having lower abundance of

1116
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,880
cardinales like do you think that like

1117
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,520
like what do you think this is doing to

1118
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,318
the insects if they have I guess these

1119
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:16,159
are mutants but what yeah yeah I think

1120
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,318
that it is there's definitely potential

1121
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:22,000
there for differences I mean it's

1122
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,800
definitely known that I think the five

1123
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,639
beta C analy are generally thought to be

1124
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,280
more

1125
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,598
toxic uh although I've Maybe seen some

1126
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,240
conflicting things with that and I don't

1127
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,359
want to speculate too much without

1128
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,679
knowing uh for sure one thing about so

1129
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,078
what Marty alluded to was with the

1130
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,679
progesterone 5 beta reductase mutant

1131
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,440
that Mia made it was a one the

1132
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,558
chemically mutagenized line she

1133
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,760
tested uh insect growth and she

1134
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,800
generally

1135
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,119
saw better growth on the

1136
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,280
mutants no they grew worse on the

1137
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,119
mutants anyway there was a conflict

1138
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,960
between what she saw in the mutant line

1139
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:02,440
or when she was doing insect feeding and

1140
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,800
when she was doing the the sodium

1141
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,960
potassium inhibition assay um and so

1142
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,720
there's also potential there for

1143
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,318
different for different herbivores like

1144
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,879
some herbivores the five Alpha Cales

1145
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,000
might be more effective against some the

1146
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,039
F beta might be more effective against

1147
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,519
um and then another thing with that

1148
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,639
mutant was the Hydrox silation was

1149
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:24,440
completely gone um and so the that can

1150
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:26,118
affect the polarity of the cardenales

1151
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,119
which could also affect things like

1152
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,559
uptake and AC ity which might explain

1153
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,358
why we're seeing a difference between

1154
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,079
the feeding and the invitro

1155
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,799
assay yeah um you said for the

1156
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,160
progesterone there's two enzymes working

1157
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,280
and that was also seen in

1158
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,838
bacteria yeah for yeah yes could that be

1159
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,079
like horizontal transfer you look at the

1160
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,719
sequences or do you think it's just

1161
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,039
converging I don't think it's horizontal

1162
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:53,598
transfer no um I did look at the

1163
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:56,960
sequences um I mean there are there are

1164
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:59,280
homologous enzymes in animals of the

1165
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,318
what as far as I can tell only has the

1166
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,519
ketosteroid isomerase activity um and I

1167
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:07,239
couldn't

1168
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:09,000
find I couldn't find a lot of

1169
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:11,919
information about what those enzymes are

1170
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
doing in animals so I think there's a

1171
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,880
lot to be done I think what I did did

1172
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,079
um still leaves a lot of questions open

1173
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,519
um but I don't think it was horizontal

1174
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,640
gen transfer

1175
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:28,679
now so I think we're out of the time

1176
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,679
let's thank for one more time

1177
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:40,679
this has been a production of Cornell

1178
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,679
University on the web at cornell.edu
