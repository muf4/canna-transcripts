1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,519
good um before getting into the the

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,679
actual seminar i'd like to

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
acknowledge some of my

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,240
former graduate students and

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,320
and colleagues

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,439
ralph brown from university of guelph

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199
that

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,759
did a lot of the work on

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,880
remote sensing in these projects

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
and then

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,799
javad hakimi mary jaczynski

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,078
matthew marciniak david letterhoff jim

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,919
wellworth

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
were all graduate students that worked

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,399
on a lot of these projects and

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,840
so i want to acknowledge their hard work

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
i thought it started off with a little

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,320
bit of a

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
just a funny slide just to

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,600
show you what my office sort of looked

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,840
like almost 30 years ago in summerland

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
after i left

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,760
cornell and the the point i wanted to

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
make about this was

27
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,759
you don't see a computer there in fact

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,560
you don't see anything electronic really

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,560
these offices that we were sitting in 30

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,478
years ago were not a whole lot different

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,118
from an office that you would have sat

32
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,840
in in the 1920s really

33
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,799
you know lots of paper a dial phone no

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
voice

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
no voice mail

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
no email

37
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,000
no computers

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
and uh

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
you can imagine just how far we have

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
come

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
in in the research field

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,079
in terms of our

43
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,359
reliance on electronics over the last 30

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,759
years

45
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,599
and you know if you look at my my office

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
now

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,919
i have

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
i haven't quite got the whole idea of

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
the paperless society

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,280
obviously

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,759
but the main thing is is this

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,799
and we all have computers

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,200
we all have voice mail

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,439
we all have cell phones

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,560
very often that take pictures

56
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:13,120
so there's been a tremendous reliance on

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,120
computers computers that help us write

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
computers that help us communicate

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,719
help us

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
analyze data

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,439
and a number of other things

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,920
and so without electronics uh it would

63
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,359
be a very very different world

64
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,679
and

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
electronics has helped us in

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
horticulture as well

67
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,359
and electronics has helped us in terms

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
of mapping

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,599
and

70
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,280
getting into a whole new

71
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,719
scheme of things that i refer to as

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
geomatics

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,519
use of gps

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,039
use of

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
gis

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,878
and uh and vineyard mapping and uh

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,719
horticultural mapping doesn't have to be

78
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,439
vineyards it can be orchards it could be

79
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,519
uh

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,000
agronomic crops and a whole bunch of

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,000
other things

82
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,719
so what what i'd like to talk a little

83
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,799
bit about today is

84
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,318
use of gps for

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,959
purposes of site and vine location

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,280
data acquisition and how we acquire data

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,640
whether it be from

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,280
vehicles like planes or or drones or

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,000
tethered balloons and we we've tried it

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,800
all

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,280
or from from the ground and there's uh

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,959
lots of ways of doing that

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,239
spectral meters there's something called

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,719
green seeker where you can take

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,120
lateral views of the canopy

96
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,199
and and collect spectral reflectance

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,599
data uh from from that

98
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,280
so there's all kinds of uh tools out

99
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,798
there that we can use

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,878
and then there's of course the the whole

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
data analysis and display what do we do

102
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,399
with all this data

103
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,719
and that's where

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
gis comes in and

105
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,239
arc is the main

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,438
gis program that is used throughout the

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
world now

108
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,878
when i first started with this in the

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,598
mid to late 90s there was a program

110
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,280
called map info and vertical mapper and

111
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,479
so i'm still most familiar with that so

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,239
i'm going to have to learn arc one of

113
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,318
these days probably before mary

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,759
jaczynski leaves because she's the ones

115
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,279
going to have to teach me

116
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,959
and then after this of course it's all

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,798
about data interpretation once you've

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,079
got a map

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,638
that's very nice but how do

120
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,719
all the different maps

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,040
integrate with each other

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
how can one variable relate to another

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,199
in terms of spatial variability and

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
things of that nature and so that's when

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,439
we start getting into

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
uh precision viticulture and making use

127
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,120
of this

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
to apply different treatments to

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,399
different parts of

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,478
individual blocks

131
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,120
and getting into things like micro

132
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,120
terroirs

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
so

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,560
what about just basic site location or

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
basic vine location this is where we use

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
uh

137
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,400
gps

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,280
in order to delineate blocks and to

139
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,839
geo-locate individual vines that we're

140
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,879
going to use for for

141
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,038
mapping and uh

142
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,319
if you go back 15 years there was not a

143
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:20,000
lot of people that had even heard a gps

144
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,319
but gps had been used for a few years

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
in agronomic crops and was being used

146
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,279
for for the sake of precision viticul or

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,680
precision agriculture in soybeans and

148
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,918
wheat and corn potatoes and things of

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
that nature but it really had not been

150
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,038
applied to

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,038
horticultural crops at that point

152
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,478
this is what we can do this is a

153
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:45,759
vineyard block this is a about a 10-acre

154
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,639
riesling block and those different uh

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,960
numbers on there are elevations

156
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,240
and what it's showing you pretty well is

157
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,879
uh just some high and low elevations i i

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
take it this is a uh

159
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,759
yeah there we are

160
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
uh so these

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,000
kind of red and orange areas are the

162
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
highest elevation zones

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
in the block and then we've got this

164
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,279
kind of a a little bit of a trough in

165
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,680
here and then it goes down

166
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,918
into a low elevation zone here

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,400
and these are all the individual vines

168
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,279
that we took data from and we collected

169
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,439
a whole layer cake of maps

170
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,559
from this particular block

171
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,719
on on yield and vine size and and bricks

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,879
and titratable acidity and a whole bunch

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,199
of other things and we can see all the

174
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,519
different relationships between all

175
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,160
these different variables spatially and

176
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:42,560
see what variables happen to correlate

177
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
with which with uh with other variables

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
a lot of these data can be collected

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,720
from uh not just from the ground but

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,879
from the air and

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
when i was doing some work with with dr

182
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,680
brown from university of guelph we were

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,600
using

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,319
a small

185
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,840
plane such as this with a large

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,800
camera inside and we took a

187
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,359
uh

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
photographs from from the air from this

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,639
uh but there's lots lots of other things

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,759
that you can use and uh there are now

191
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,280
different kinds of drones and unmanned

192
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,080
um

193
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,038
um objects out there that you can use

194
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:24,000
and attach small cameras to these and

195
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,519
they can collect uh data for you

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
they're not cheap

197
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,839
um but there are some companies out

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,478
there that are now making use of these

199
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,439
these drones and

200
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,800
unmanned objects

201
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,519
and then you can collect things from the

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,520
ground this is in champaign at a place

203
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,318
called plum cook

204
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,598
and

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,520
this little

206
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,959
tractor here has got a green seeker

207
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,959
mounted to it

208
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,680
and a

209
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,878
multi-spectral camera and they take it

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
through the

211
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
uh the vineyards

212
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,400
and create these different maps

213
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,639
eventually from all the the data that

214
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,878
they collect and what you're seeing in

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,120
the background here are a whole bunch of

216
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,160
different maps that they've created

217
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,639
on

218
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,439
spectral effects of the leaves and

219
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,120
potential anthocyanins in the uh in the

220
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,120
fruit and a number of other things

221
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,279
and this is just a a close-up this is

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,240
the the green seeker

223
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,679
that's measuring spectral reflectance

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,120
and

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,038
here we have a

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,278
a multi-spectral camera you can see all

227
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,718
the different lenses in there and that's

228
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,759
mounted and then they take a whole

229
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,080
series of lateral images throughout the

230
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,559
vineyard and the same thing can happen

231
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560
uh if you want to in in orchards and

232
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,559
things like that might be difficult in

233
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,639
uh traditional apple archers but i would

234
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,919
say in

235
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,519
something like a

236
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
a super spindle

237
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
or or some of the more modern

238
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,000
trellised orchards it would work very

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,000
very well

240
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
the type of data that you collect isn't

241
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,759
just spectral reflectance you can

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,920
collect everything and

243
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,439
take all of these data and relate it to

244
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,639
some of the spectral data that you're

245
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
collecting so it could be

246
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,439
things like

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,879
vine water status and soil water status

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,879
and we've done a lot of work like that

249
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,879
of course yield

250
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,838
basic fruit composition some some

251
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,278
specialized fruit compositions such as

252
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,800
terpenes and

253
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,639
things like riesling

254
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,919
or

255
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,439
anthocyanins and phenolics and things of

256
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,120
that nature that you could collect for

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
red wine varieties

258
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,480
and then there's the whole

259
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,958
series of soil and

260
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
vine composition parameters you might

261
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,559
want to collect whether it's soil

262
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,560
texture soil composition

263
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,479
petiole composition and so on and so

264
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,599
forth so you can see that you could

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,159
create this

266
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,000
multi-layered

267
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,240
uh set of

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
maps just to see

269
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
where you're getting uh different

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,320
relationships between all these

271
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
different variables

272
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,480
and then you need to manipulate this

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,759
data somehow so once you've got all this

274
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,159
data

275
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,958
using things like leaf water potential

276
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,360
and and vine size and soil texture

277
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,599
as basically treatments

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,480
and zones within these different uh

279
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,159
vineyard blocks and then you can look at

280
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
these different categories and see how

281
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,439
they might impact

282
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,439
um

283
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
wine composition and wine quality and

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
we've done a lot of that over the years

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,480
and then of course looking at

286
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,239
correlations between the variables and

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,000
spatial correlations

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,200
and then the important thing is temporal

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,200
stability

290
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,600
are these different zones going to be

291
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
stable over time year after year after

292
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,079
year they're going to bounce around

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
and it's very important especially if

294
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,719
you're going to be

295
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,959
trying to use some sort of precision

296
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
agriculture that you have

297
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,000
temporally stable zones

298
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,000
year after year

299
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,159
so these uh for instances

300
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,039
are one way of displaying the data these

301
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,000
are some

302
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,838
maps that were created from greenseeker

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,159
at plumecook

304
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,480
vineyard in

305
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,120
champaign

306
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,720
i was over there in in june

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
and so there's a whole bunch of

308
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,600
different things

309
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,239
this one is a

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,240
nitrogen status here

311
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
unfortunately i've got my glasses on but

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,879
you can probably read some of these

313
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
yourself

314
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,159
particularly if you understand french

315
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,439
but in some cases there's things like

316
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,759
anthocyanins and and a number of other

317
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,640
things that they can use and

318
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,439
look at some of the different zones

319
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
high nitrogen zones here lower nitrogen

320
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
zones

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
in in this area and then you can

322
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,879
take

323
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,440
precision viticulture and you can try to

324
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,679
smooth things out and get rid of some of

325
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
that

326
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,799
instability and

327
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,240
some of that variability that you're

328
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,240
finding in those different blocks

329
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,079
with remote sensing

330
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,359
generally what we were doing was taking

331
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,120
aerial flyovers to collect uh

332
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
multi-spectral data

333
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,519
and then we would take also some

334
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,720
multi-spectral data from the ground in

335
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,278
order to

336
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,800
not just compare but also to verify the

337
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,000
the data that we were collecting from

338
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,240
the air and and then we would need to

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,240
manipulate this data

340
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
as you can imagine there's a lot of data

341
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,120
to collect and so we need to use some

342
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
specialized software in order to take

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,440
those pixels

344
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,240
and turn those pixels into maps

345
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,120
and very often if you happen to have

346
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,959
canopy as well as ground cover you need

347
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
to get rid of all those pixels that are

348
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,958
ground cover so that you just have the

349
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,879
canopy data to

350
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,879
manipulate and map otherwise

351
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,720
you're essentially going to have green

352
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,078
data all the way across works very well

353
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,000
in australia where it's all

354
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,359
tilled in between the rows and the only

355
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,078
green you have

356
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,560
is going to be the uh

357
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,719
the grapevine canopies but in

358
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,078
new york state and ontario and other

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
parts of uh

360
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,199
especially eastern north america you've

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,958
got that

362
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
ground cover crop that you have to deal

363
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,199
with

364
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,120
and this is a example from one of my

365
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,200
former graduate students

366
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,278
he's got some different

367
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,440
blocks here that

368
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,320
he was trying to extract what we call

369
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,160
ndvi data which is normalized difference

370
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
vegetation index

371
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,838
is based on

372
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
spectral reflectance in the the green

373
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
range

374
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,399
and in the the near infrared range

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,399
and so he

376
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,720
acquired these different images and then

377
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,720
got rid of the

378
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,039
cover crop

379
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,639
pixels like this and then from there

380
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,519
created this

381
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,639
actual ndvi map and you can see that

382
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,560
it's a

383
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
fairly homogeneous throughout but

384
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,319
there's some

385
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,920
zones here of higher ndvi

386
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,959
and a small area here where there's

387
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,958
lower ndvi

388
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,078
and why do you use this ndvi well

389
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,519
because it can relate very closely to

390
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,359
things that we're

391
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,039
interested in and we feel it are

392
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,519
important these are some

393
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,519
data from

394
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,679
andrew lamb at all from australia and

395
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,399
you're seeing some

396
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,879
relationships here between

397
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,000
inverse relationships between ndvi and

398
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,759
things like phenolics

399
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,440
anthocyanins color and things of that

400
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,120
nature so generally these low ndvi areas

401
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,600
are typically

402
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,278
related to lower vigor

403
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
lower yield and so consequently

404
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,679
higher color

405
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,679
and higher phenolics

406
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,519
all right

407
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,359
move on talk a little bit about

408
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,720
data interpretation

409
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,199
and precision viticulture

410
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,160
so precision viticulture

411
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,759
basically how has it been used thus far

412
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,919
it hasn't been something that's been

413
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,720
popular and a lot of that is is that

414
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,759
it takes time and you usually need to

415
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,079
have a person that is dedicated

416
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,078
to collecting these data and

417
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,958
interpreting these data for you it's not

418
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,159
something that as a grower

419
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,119
it's something you're going to be able

420
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,519
to do in your spare time i know my my ex

421
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,120
student david letterhoff was hired

422
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,440
specifically by

423
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,839
a winemaker in

424
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,480
british columbia and that's what he does

425
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,720
he does only precision viticulture and

426
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,800
only data collection and interpretation

427
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,800
so it's going to involve gps in order to

428
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,799
delineate the shapes of blocks to

429
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,278
geo locate vines

430
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,560
and things like that

431
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,679
and then of course you're going to need

432
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:32,399
to have gis software in order to manage

433
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:34,559
these data create the maps and help you

434
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,000
look at interrelationships between all

435
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
these different variables that you're

436
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
mapping

437
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:45,039
with agronomic crops

438
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,039
gps monitors have been

439
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,599
installed on things like combines

440
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,719
of our other harvesting equipment so

441
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,120
that you can very precisely map yield

442
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
and then go in there after the following

443
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,560
year

444
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,039
and try to smooth out some of those

445
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,879
low yielding areas by

446
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,798
adding a little bit more fertilizer

447
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,959
etcetera to some of those low yielding

448
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,279
areas a little bit less fertilizer to

449
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,558
some of those higher yielding areas

450
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,038
and so you can get some very precise uh

451
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,678
very location specific

452
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,119
yield maps that will help you do that

453
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,759
and

454
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,239
it might not just simply be

455
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,038
fertilizer rates it might be things like

456
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,120
inoculum rates in the case of soybeans

457
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,919
it could be seeding rates lime

458
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,000
application and so on and so forth

459
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,679
and i'll have to say that that's what i

460
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,359
thought i was going to do

461
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,360
when i first

462
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,519
started to get

463
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,439
interested in this and started to get

464
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,079
familiar with gps and things like that

465
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,080
but i realize that

466
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,720
in in viticulture it's not going to be

467
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,199
about trying to smooth out the the bumps

468
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,759
in the road and to try to get

469
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,480
the low areas up to higher areas and the

470
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,519
higher areas down the lower ones but

471
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,880
as much as just mapping a particular

472
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:09,679
vineyard block and then maybe creating

473
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,960
micro terroir based wines

474
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,200
and

475
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,160
embracing that kind of

476
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,160
uh variability that we happen to have in

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,840
a in a large vineyard block there's

478
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,400
nothing wrong with that

479
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,079
uh so in viticulture we're taking these

480
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
data we're

481
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,839
creating these maps

482
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,679
and

483
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,678
uh seeing what we get and then seeing if

484
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,000
we might be able to

485
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,480
make use of this data

486
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,839
and uh create other

487
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,839
um

488
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,798
vineyard specific wines that might

489
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,720
actually be block specific wines

490
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,240
so a lot of that's going to be

491
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
primarily for economic gain

492
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,280
another

493
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,679
look at some some maps from an

494
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,519
australian vineyard this is from some of

495
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,960
rob bramley's work

496
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,558
who's been doing quite a bit of work

497
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,840
with precision viticulture over the

498
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,240
years

499
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,240
this first one on the on the right or on

500
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,798
the left hand side rather

501
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,880
from the margaret river

502
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,319
showing a cabernet sauvignon block and

503
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
you can see some

504
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,279
low yielding areas here some higher

505
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,558
yielding areas in here and what they did

506
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,480
was they

507
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,639
separated

508
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
this fruit

509
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
in accordance to yield

510
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
and then produce different wines from uh

511
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,600
from the different yielding areas and

512
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,120
produce very different wines so this

513
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,399
might have been something that would go

514
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,279
into

515
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,280
say a 35 or 40 dollar bottle of wine

516
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,720
and some of this stuff

517
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,240
may have gone into yellowtail or

518
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,720
something like that and so they've been

519
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,200
able to produce these different whys and

520
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,279
we're trying to do the same in niagara

521
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,840
here's an example of how they were able

522
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,759
to use

523
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,839
gps uh to see how their pest control

524
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,759
practices have been uh

525
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,000
working and see how effective they are

526
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,079
and so these are botrytis severity maps

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,240
you can see some areas where it's very

528
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,960
severe over in this area

529
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,160
and some area areas where it's not quite

530
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,480
as severe

531
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,840
uh over here so obviously they're going

532
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
to need to

533
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:19,720
maybe bump up their their spray program

534
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,720
in some parts of this particular block

535
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,519
so on sites to be planted how can you

536
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,200
use this stuff well basically

537
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,839
you've got

538
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,440
um a bare canvas

539
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:36,879
so you you want to take lots of soil

540
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,519
samples obviously you can very precisely

541
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,039
map that land in terms of things like

542
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,079
soil texture

543
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:46,960
and mineral composition and slope and

544
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,119
a number of other variables such as that

545
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,279
and if you're seeing a lot of

546
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,959
variability you might say well i think i

547
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,079
might want to plant this end of the

548
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,798
vineyard

549
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,639
um with a different root stock maybe i

550
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,798
want to plant this end of the vineyard

551
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,000
with

552
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,359
something like so4 because it's a heavy

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
clay i need something that's going to

554
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,119
bust through that clay

555
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
uh at this end of the soil i've got sand

556
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,000
i i think maybe i'll uh use something

557
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,720
like 3309 or

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,599
riparia glower or something like that

559
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,159
and

560
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,158
you can use this information to

561
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,480
make choices in terms of not just root

562
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,558
stock but also

563
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,200
planting density

564
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,960
possibly even trellis system if you're

565
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,519
expecting one end of this

566
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,038
the vineyard to uh to be a lot more uh

567
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,200
vigorous you might want to use scott

568
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,720
henry at that end of the vineyard and

569
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,919
you might want to use just a standard

570
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,919
vsp

571
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,640
at the other end so there's a lot of

572
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,440
things and a lot of

573
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,600
different decisions that you can make

574
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,159
once you have this information and once

575
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,158
it's mapped

576
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,319
here's a here's an example um

577
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,158
this is a vineyard called chateau de

578
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,200
charm in

579
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,559
saint david's near niagara in the lake

580
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,240
these are two

581
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,918
side by side

582
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
chardonnay blocks

583
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,080
one as you can see is very high in sand

584
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,960
we've got about 72 to 82 percent sand in

585
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,079
here

586
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,919
and then over here it's mostly clay they

587
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,399
planted it all the same

588
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,480
they probably could have planted this at

589
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,038
a different planting density and given

590
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,519
the vines a little more room

591
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,359
and planted these a little bit tighter

592
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,558
so there were things that could have

593
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,359
been done

594
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,279
with

595
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,359
had they had this information right from

596
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,359
the get-go

597
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,240
on established sites there are a lot of

598
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,558
things you can do as well um

599
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,038
things can be precisely mapped of course

600
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,879
and you can still get all of that soil

601
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,359
data but you can get a lot of other

602
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
things you can delineate management

603
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,839
zones

604
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,159
once you know what the yield is what

605
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,079
what the vine size is and things like

606
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,559
that

607
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,720
you might be able to

608
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,119
implement implement some variable rate

609
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,960
technology as a result but the other

610
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,079
thing is is that if you

611
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,640
have some very clear differences in one

612
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,960
part of a block versus another you can

613
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,759
create two different products and those

614
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,400
two different products could

615
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,400
as i say

616
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,279
be used for economic gain you could

617
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,798
produce a very very high-end wine versus

618
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,399
something that's

619
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,720
more like a fifteen dollar bottle of

620
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
wine

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,679
here's an example

622
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,079
uh this is uh where we were mapping uh

623
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,038
flavor compounds in riesling

624
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,759
and this is at the cave spring vineyards

625
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:55,200
and these uh orange zones here orange

626
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,960
and yellow zones happen to be the areas

627
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,000
um where we were getting the highest

628
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
terpene

629
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,519
values

630
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:05,439
in the uh the riesling and there did

631
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:09,038
seem to be some temporal consistency

632
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,480
depending on year once we got into 2007

633
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,558
here

634
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,200
there happened to be a little bit larger

635
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:19,119
area with very high terpenes be because

636
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,640
it happened to be a dry air uh season

637
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,359
berries were smaller a little more

638
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
concentrated and so the

639
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,199
the high flavor zone

640
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,639
actually increased in size but generally

641
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,679
we're seeing

642
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,038
the same kind of temporal consistency so

643
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,200
had this company had this information

644
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,200
they might have wanted to go in and try

645
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,519
to

646
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,759
pick one zone like this

647
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,519
here or here and create a couple of

648
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,798
different

649
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,798
products as a consequence

650
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,319
why isn't it being used well like most

651
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,038
things in horticulture it's money

652
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,359
and it does take

653
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,599
time to collect all these data

654
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,359
and variable rate technology of course

655
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,519
isn't cheap we've had a couple of

656
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,000
growers that have tried to implement

657
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,918
some variable rate technology with

658
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
yield monitors on their harvesters and

659
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,960
things like that

660
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,600
and they've given it up mainly because

661
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,960
of cost

662
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,599
how however we could still

663
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,759
collect the data and possibly create

664
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,798
different products as a result

665
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,558
of that

666
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,839
the other thing is is the whole temporal

667
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,839
stability issue

668
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,918
here's an example of why it sometimes

669
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,558
doesn't work

670
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,559
my colleague joan davenport in

671
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,038
washington state did some work with the

672
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,278
yield monitor in concord vineyard

673
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,359
and so it's four different years where

674
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,200
they've got a yield monitor mounted on a

675
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,319
mechanical harvester

676
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
and

677
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,480
these

678
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,439
kind of red and yellow zones in this

679
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,319
block

680
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,080
represent the highest yielding areas

681
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,158
within that block

682
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,439
and then we get to the following year

683
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,600
and suddenly

684
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
the yield has dropped considerably and

685
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,879
the

686
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,559
pattern of the yield is is completely

687
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,559
different and then we go to the

688
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,519
following year and it's different once

689
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,278
again

690
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,158
and different

691
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,798
in in 2000 so we don't have that

692
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,520
temporal stability and without that we

693
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,918
can't really implement any kind of

694
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,440
variable rate technology doesn't always

695
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,720
happen this way

696
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,720
but very often it does

697
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,240
and this is one case where it does this

698
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,240
is a

699
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
block in niagara in the lake near where

700
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
i live

701
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,080
and

702
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
these yellow and orange zones happen to

703
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,599
be the highest yielding zone so over a

704
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,278
five year period for the most part we

705
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,158
were getting

706
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,278
high yielding zones in this

707
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,520
upper

708
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,839
part of the block and lower yielding

709
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,918
zones down here and it's going to bounce

710
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,319
around a little bit depending on what

711
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,799
kind of a year it is precipitation

712
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,798
patterns

713
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,558
things things of that nature

714
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,879
and you can also get spatial

715
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,960
stability or temp temporal stability in

716
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,919
things like bricks and uh and other

717
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,278
things this is another vineyard and

718
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,520
these uh

719
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,640
yellow and orange zones happen to be the

720
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,319
highest bricks zones as well and they

721
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,840
seem to

722
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:31,119
be relatively temporally stable

723
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:34,558
a little bit larger area here in 2002

724
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:37,119
because it happened to be a hot uh dry

725
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,119
summer so it expanded it's a little bit

726
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,839
smaller here but generally you're

727
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,399
getting that temporal stability and in

728
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,918
all of these graphs the scales are

729
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,240
different between here

730
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,640
yeah the scales are different equal

731
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,359
segments yeah within the range for each

732
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,960
year

733
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,439
that's right what we did that's a good

734
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,399
question what we did was uh for for all

735
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,200
of the data we just asked uh

736
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,719
the mapping program to give us uh

737
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,399
six different

738
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,798
uh

739
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,798
individual

740
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,639
denominations and so there was going to

741
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,038
be some difference so there are higher

742
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,520
bricks here for instance versus

743
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,839
a year such as 2001

744
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,079
so there there are some some differences

745
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,079
there

746
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,720
okay uh

747
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,600
move on talk a little bit about

748
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,480
geomatics on a regional basis before i

749
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,879
move on and talk about

750
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,360
micro terroirs and things like that this

751
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,799
is something you might recognize this is

752
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,599
seneca lake

753
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:43,759
and this is some some data from from bob

754
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:46,000
seam so i acknowledge bob seen

755
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,319
what he's got here is uh

756
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,919
based on a whole bunch of uh

757
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,240
weather stations

758
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,720
uh along seneca lake

759
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,759
and uh this is the christmas massacre of

760
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,679
1980. so all of these uh pink zones here

761
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,599
on the west side of seneca lake

762
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,600
represent cold areas

763
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,359
just before and during the christmas

764
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,600
massacre

765
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,398
and then after that

766
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,000
that cold air moved across seneca lake

767
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,278
because seneca lake of course doesn't

768
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,278
freeze it picked up some some warm air

769
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,679
uh crossing that lake

770
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,038
and then this blue area here

771
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,440
is some

772
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,038
slightly warmed air

773
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,600
that

774
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:34,798
that we see on this side of seneca lake

775
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,879
but then once that air moved on

776
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:41,119
and got further away from the lake it

777
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,600
picked up more cold air from the uh

778
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,359
as a result of continentality and you

779
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,599
see you've got cold air

780
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:52,158
over here so it just shows the effect of

781
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:54,719
seneca lake on a regional basis even in

782
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,600
1980 where we had uh temperatures close

783
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,600
to minus 30.

784
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,440
and there's

785
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,679
uh i think that was fahrenheit wasn't it

786
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,960
it was cold

787
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
yeah

788
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,558
i remember it being very cold

789
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,000
and this is something that you can do of

790
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,240
course and there's just growing degree

791
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,599
days in the napa valley and some of paul

792
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,319
skinner's work

793
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,558
uh you can see uh slightly lower growing

794
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,798
degree days down here because of the the

795
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,200
influence of san francisco bay

796
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,359
and as you get further up uh

797
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,440
napa valley you're getting into some

798
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,599
higher growing degree days

799
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,440
and then uh drops a little bit once you

800
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,879
get up around calistoga because you're

801
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,360
higher elevation and uh and so on and so

802
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,799
forth so that's another way you can make

803
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,558
use of

804
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,079
multiple uh

805
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,918
weather stations

806
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,639
and you can map growing degree days and

807
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,640
things like that

808
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,399
um

809
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,679
what i like to spend most of the rest of

810
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,879
this talk on is geomatics site

811
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
and uh

812
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,760
mapping things like yield and vine size

813
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,960
and water status

814
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:08,720
here's an example of a micro terroir

815
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,759
this is desolate in switzerland and

816
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,360
this is uh next to lausanne in in

817
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,079
western switzerland

818
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:19,359
and all of these different vineyards

819
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,678
up and down this uh hillside here

820
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,119
it's all chassella

821
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,440
the

822
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,398
age of the vines is relatively similar

823
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,600
but because of elevation and a number of

824
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,158
other things

825
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,798
these are all different terroirs and

826
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,880
they actually make different wines

827
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,639
depending on where

828
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,799
along this hillside

829
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,720
you're picking those chassella and they

830
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,960
are distinctly different if you go into

831
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,278
some of the wineries there where you can

832
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,600
taste some of these different wines it's

833
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,319
quite incredible it's a

834
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,079
real educational experience

835
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,759
so this is the kind of thing

836
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,918
what we wanted to look at and this is

837
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,440
going back to the the same riesling

838
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,278
vineyard that i showed you near the

839
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,240
beginning this is the saint urban

840
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,079
vineyard

841
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,759
and

842
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,599
what we're seeing here are differences

843
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:12,079
in vine size a high vine size zone here

844
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,439
low vine size zone

845
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,398
in this area

846
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,399
and in many cases these uh vine size or

847
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,158
vigor zones can be related to things

848
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,359
like yield

849
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,880
bricks

850
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,038
flavor and a number of other things

851
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,600
here's our friend shadow de charm this

852
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,759
is these are different yield zones

853
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,678
and those are those two two chardonnay

854
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,278
blocks side by side

855
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,399
a low yielding zone here in that sandy

856
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,278
block

857
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,678
and a high yielding zone

858
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,278
next door to it in that

859
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,960
heavy clay block

860
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,359
and then this jumped back and forth

861
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,120
unfortunately over over the period of

862
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,119
the four years we were collecting data

863
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,278
and then the other thing is is

864
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,398
collecting flavor data and mapping

865
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,398
flavor

866
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:06,000
and wouldn't that be great if you could

867
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,599
map flavor and create different wines

868
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,599
because you know

869
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,759
the potential flavor from from the

870
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,319
different zones in that particular block

871
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:17,038
so high flavor zone here

872
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,678
and a relatively lower flavor zone over

873
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,679
on this side

874
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,678
this is a way that

875
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:29,200
it has been used

876
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,120
commercially and this is some data from

877
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,080
mark greenspan when he was working for

878
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,119
gallo

879
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,439
back about 10 years ago where he went in

880
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,199
and used a number of different things

881
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,278
leaf water potential

882
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,919
vine size

883
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:48,319
ndvi data and

884
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,320
combined all of these and created some

885
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,558
some maps from this

886
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,240
hillside zinfandel vineyard

887
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,639
and created a

888
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,839
low vigor zone and a high vigor zone and

889
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,799
so

890
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,879
this low bigger zone went into their

891
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,038
35

892
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,360
sonoma reserve and their

893
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,358
high vigor zone that probably went into

894
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,398
either rose or barefoot or something

895
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,960
like that

896
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,358
so different different products from the

897
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,398
from the same block based on

898
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,159
information and just knowing

899
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,319
what you have there and the more data

900
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,240
you can collect

901
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,079
the more money you can make basically

902
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,078
from a given vineyard block

903
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,118
um

904
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,199
i

905
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,679
spent a moment just going back to how i

906
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,439
got into this in the first place

907
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,440
when i was working in

908
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,440
bc in the the early 90s

909
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,000
working with a geologist and did some

910
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,800
zoning

911
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,239
work but this was before gps so we were

912
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
just using a

913
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,358
transit and uh

914
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,759
trying to do everything using uh

915
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,279
just old-fashioned uh

916
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,520
elevations and

917
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
leaf layer numbers and bricks and ta and

918
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,880
ph and

919
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,400
use kriegging

920
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,079
and

921
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,000
mapped all these different variables and

922
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,760
try to create some different zones from

923
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,199
uh from a small vineyard

924
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,440
and then in the

925
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,838
later 90s

926
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,000
we had an 85 acre

927
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,279
vineyard multi-variety vineyard on the

928
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,320
hillside

929
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,920
and

930
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,880
used gps and gis to map a whole bunch of

931
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,880
different variables

932
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,039
so there's one example of

933
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,559
some of the work we did

934
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,599
pre-gps

935
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,920
we had about 200 different uh

936
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,280
vines that we took uh samples from in

937
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,440
this vigorous geoverse demeanor vineyard

938
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,200
next to skaha lake in

939
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,760
penticton bc

940
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,239
uh you can see the the vigor there and

941
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,160
what we were trying to do is look at uh

942
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,279
different brick zones

943
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,559
and then

944
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,359
once we had those brics data try to

945
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,679
create some different management zones

946
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:07,519
based on these brics data

947
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,639
and that was all as i say pre-gps days

948
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,480
and then with

949
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,358
the stuff at paradise

950
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,599
vineyard we actually did have some

951
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,239
some geomatic tools you can

952
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,440
get an idea of

953
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,479
this is uh

954
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,039
lake okanagan here so it was a

955
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,599
steep hillside vineyard with a lot of

956
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:30,880
different ravines and things like that

957
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,280
all through there so we had some major

958
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,440
variability throughout this

959
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,440
this vineyard in terms of

960
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,159
not just elevation but

961
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,720
things like vine size and yield and

962
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,159
bricks and ta and ph and

963
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,480
all the different

964
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,480
soil and petiole variables as well

965
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,400
all right move on i'll talk a little bit

966
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,519
about geomatics of water status which

967
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,320
was some uh work that was uh

968
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,320
done starting in 2005

969
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:07,199
some work by jim wilworth that's now our

970
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:10,239
extension viticulturist

971
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,480
2005 to 11 and uh

972
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:15,679
javad hakimi who worked at the same time

973
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,679
but on cabernet franc

974
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,000
what we did was

975
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,599
we chose 10 different sites throughout

976
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,760
the niagara peninsula there's lake

977
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,000
ontario here

978
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,680
each of these sites represented a

979
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,760
specific

980
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,399
sub-appellation so we had 10 different

981
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,640
sub-appellations throughout there and

982
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
tried to pick out

983
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,358
representative vineyards

984
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,639
in each of those different

985
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,319
sub-appellations for both riesling and

986
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,559
cabernet franc

987
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,119
and ran this project over a three-year

988
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,119
period mapped things such as

989
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,639
leaf water potential and and soil

990
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,639
moisture

991
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,440
and went in there on a

992
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,598
bi-weekly basis to collect these data

993
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,358
and then in the in the fall collect data

994
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,838
on uh

995
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,000
things such

996
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,000
as you know clusters per vine and yield

997
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,079
and uh

998
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,480
standard berry composition

999
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,599
and in uh riesling we were collecting

1000
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
terpenes

1001
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,800
for the berries and for the cabernet

1002
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,760
franc

1003
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,800
phenolics anthocyanins and color and

1004
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,800
things of that nature

1005
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,119
and this gives you some idea

1006
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,358
walk you through

1007
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,519
one site for riesling to just give you

1008
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:33,279
some idea what we were finding

1009
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,039
and this is the myers vineyard on the

1010
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,119
lake

1011
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,519
here we have leaf water potential so the

1012
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
one thing to point out

1013
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,599
we've got low leaf water potential here

1014
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,838
so this was

1015
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,800
the southern end of the vineyard and it

1016
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,599
was

1017
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,640
somewhat underwater stress each year

1018
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,960
and then

1019
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,799
higher leaf water potential in the

1020
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,119
northern end of the vineyard

1021
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,280
nice temporal stability we were glad to

1022
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,119
see this

1023
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,200
you'll notice that the the numbers are a

1024
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,559
little bit different uh

1025
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:10,078
2007 we were getting numbers in the uh

1026
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:12,960
minus 12 to almost minus 13 range it was

1027
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,480
a a dry year and it was a they were not

1028
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,480
quite as low

1029
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,159
in 2005 and 2006.

1030
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,719
now we start to see

1031
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,239
how these relate to other things that

1032
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,319
are important

1033
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,838
first of all

1034
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,838
up here where we have the

1035
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,039
higher leaf water potential we've also

1036
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,920
got higher soil moisture

1037
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,759
and we've also got higher vine size so

1038
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,599
more vigor

1039
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,920
higher soil moisture

1040
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,320
higher leaf water potential so already

1041
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,480
some nice relationships

1042
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,720
as we move on here's our leaf water

1043
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,920
potential again

1044
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,319
so

1045
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,720
high leaf water potential low

1046
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,440
and up here we're getting higher berry

1047
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,559
weights lower berry weights down here

1048
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,920
and

1049
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,279
down here where we're getting the lower

1050
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,280
berry weights we're also getting

1051
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,078
higher brix values

1052
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,480
now this is where it gets i think quite

1053
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,240
compelling this is a different site uh

1054
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,679
because it happens to show the

1055
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,159
relationships a little bit better and

1056
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,838
these are leaf water potentials here

1057
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,598
um 05 to o7

1058
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:27,759
and these are the the lower leaf water

1059
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,320
potential zones here that are

1060
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,040
for the most part temporally stable

1061
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,359
and you can see the potentially volatile

1062
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,239
terpenes that line up

1063
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:38,719
um

1064
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,959
very nicely with these uh lower leaf

1065
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,879
water potentials

1066
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,199
so this guy paul boss this shadow

1067
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,079
descharm has in fact created some

1068
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,679
different

1069
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,400
wine products

1070
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,879
from this particular block

1071
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,800
based on these data and so he's quite

1072
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,800
excited and quite happy with these data

1073
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,039
five minutes okay no problem

1074
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,160
talk fast

1075
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,559
um

1076
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,279
so when we look at some of the the wine

1077
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,599
and look at sensory

1078
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,319
over on this side this is pls analysis

1079
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,960
partially squares analysis we see what's

1080
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,239
related things like water potential soil

1081
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,519
moisture

1082
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:22,159
sand content berry weight vine size

1083
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,400
basically that was 75 percent

1084
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,000
of the data set and

1085
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,920
that's basically

1086
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,480
the basis for terroir right there and

1087
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,480
we're getting very different wines

1088
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,880
that are associated with the high soil

1089
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,400
moisture high water potential

1090
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,838
so things are high in citrus and mineral

1091
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
but also

1092
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,519
vegetal and things like that over on

1093
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,720
this side

1094
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:49,920
a little bit more

1095
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,439
peach apple uh baking spice and things

1096
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,519
of that nature so we're getting very

1097
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,480
different wines depending on whether

1098
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,960
we've got

1099
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,280
high or low soil moisture

1100
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,159
so that to me has got a lot to do with

1101
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,319
what terroir is all about the other

1102
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,960
thing is we were able to to look at this

1103
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,559
on a regional basis as well

1104
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,679
because we had all those different sub

1105
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,599
appellations we look at

1106
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,039
some of these different

1107
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,400
zones here's

1108
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:22,318
some lakeshore vineyards right here

1109
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,480
that were associated with mineral citrus

1110
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,358
vegetal and things like that

1111
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,358
and some of the

1112
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,318
other areas the some of the bench areas

1113
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
over here

1114
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,960
that were associated more with baking

1115
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:40,239
spice and tropical fruit and things of

1116
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,559
that nature so there did seem to be some

1117
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,559
um

1118
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,639
truth to the the sub-appellation i don't

1119
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,400
think there's ten of them but there's

1120
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,400
probably at least three anyway

1121
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,440
all right a few

1122
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,440
uh comments about cabernet franc

1123
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,280
essentially the same project

1124
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,400
you can see some of the relationships

1125
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,519
here

1126
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,440
things like percent clay and

1127
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,920
perhaps not

1128
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,679
any surprise to you it got

1129
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,000
a nice relationship to things like

1130
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:17,279
calcium and potassium and

1131
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,159
things like base saturation and soil ph

1132
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,160
so there are a lot of

1133
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,838
spatial relationships here

1134
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,920
for the most part uh temporal stability

1135
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,318
um

1136
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,039
this is uh soil moisture and you can see

1137
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,119
especially in 0.6 and 07 those soil

1138
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,079
moisture zones were were almost mirror

1139
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,680
images of each other not so much 2005

1140
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,280
and i'm not sure why that is

1141
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,919
i'll walk you through

1142
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,480
shadow de charm these are

1143
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,880
low water status zones here

1144
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,280
in the the upper part of this block in

1145
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,480
the north

1146
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,400
and as you

1147
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,960
look at some of the other variables you

1148
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,960
can see that things such as for instance

1149
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,079
leaf water potential

1150
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,880
is related to lower berry weights

1151
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,400
higher bricks higher anthocyanins

1152
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,119
higher phenols

1153
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,440
and things of that nature so once you

1154
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,039
you know some of this information you

1155
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,000
can have a pretty good idea of

1156
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,920
what you might get in terms of some

1157
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,760
some variables that that really mean

1158
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,960
something to you

1159
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,839
and pls once again we got high water

1160
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,679
status over here low water status over

1161
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,480
here associated with

1162
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,879
color and red fruit and phenols and

1163
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,199
things like that high water status

1164
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,640
associated with

1165
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,159
in particular uh bitterness and green

1166
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,199
fruit and and

1167
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,199
things of that nature

1168
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,639
and once again we did some regional

1169
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,239
assessment here

1170
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,799
and we look at

1171
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,000
these particular blocks

1172
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,920
these four

1173
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,559
are all waterfront

1174
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,639
properties so they're all associated

1175
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,519
with either lake ontario

1176
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,039
or the niagara river so cooler sites and

1177
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,280
these are all associated with things

1178
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,719
like green bean and bell pepper so most

1179
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,760
definitely

1180
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,118
some relationship between

1181
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,480
location

1182
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:25,200
and wine sensory so we did feel that we

1183
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,199
were able to

1184
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,799
verify some of these sub-appellations

1185
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,440
so in terms of these cabernet and

1186
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,279
riesling studies um

1187
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,519
we felt that there were some clear

1188
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,680
relationships between uh things like

1189
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:45,838
soil and vine water status

1190
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:48,318
as well as uh and things such as

1191
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,400
free and bound terpenes and riesling and

1192
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,639
some of the phenolic analytes and

1193
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,680
cabernet franc and i think that's really

1194
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,920
the one major take-home message and i

1195
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,078
think the other one is is that there was

1196
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,358
nice temporal stability from year to

1197
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,280
year

1198
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,400
with a lot of these relationships so if

1199
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,319
you can get in there and you can get

1200
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,559
some data

1201
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:12,400
you can have something that probably is

1202
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:14,239
going to repeat itself year after year

1203
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,800
so i'm going to probably take a couple

1204
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,399
more minutes if i may and i think i can

1205
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,000
finish off

1206
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,280
i just wanted to make a couple of

1207
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,039
mentions of

1208
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,960
some of this remote sensing work that we

1209
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,880
did

1210
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,039
using

1211
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,640
riesling and

1212
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,838
pinot noir so

1213
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,279
similar projects looking at uh

1214
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,519
soil moisture

1215
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,400
leaf water potential but we had the

1216
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,440
added set of data and that we were doing

1217
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,240
a whole lot of flyovers and collecting

1218
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,318
some

1219
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,559
spectral reflectance data

1220
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,759
as a result of the flyovers

1221
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,159
and

1222
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,079
this is one place this was the 30 bench

1223
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,159
vineyards

1224
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,680
consisted of a whole series of these

1225
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,318
sub-blocks that we were able to

1226
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,799
delineate

1227
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:06,759
this was a 25-acre riesling block we

1228
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,760
collected about 520

1229
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,838
vines or

1230
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,760
collected data from 520 vines so a lot

1231
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,078
of work

1232
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,240
and collected things like soil moisture

1233
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,839
every year and leaf water potential and

1234
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,199
so on and so forth so we were getting

1235
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,039
some nice

1236
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,159
temporal stability at least three out of

1237
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,159
four years for soil moisture 2009 never

1238
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,239
stopped raining and so we

1239
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,960
didn't see that nice temporal stability

1240
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,439
when

1241
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,318
we got to 2009

1242
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,240
and

1243
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,159
the same goes for leaf water potential

1244
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,479
we're seeing the low leaf water

1245
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,519
potential here in that that triangle

1246
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,240
zone

1247
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,239
and 2009 not so much

1248
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,599
all right i think i better

1249
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,760
finish this up and so what i'd like to

1250
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:56,400
do is i'm just going to

1251
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,760
skip ahead to the the end because we've

1252
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,519
got some work

1253
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,160
that's ongoing that we're where we're

1254
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:05,280
looking at the terroir winter hardiness

1255
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,719
and that's mary jaczynski's project

1256
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,960
so i'm just going to skip ahead about

1257
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,318
three or four slides to that

1258
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,280
and then i can

1259
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,279
take some questions

1260
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,159
okay so with this what we're doing is

1261
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,440
we're essentially mapping winter

1262
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,118
hardiness

1263
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,760
and looking at lt50 values

1264
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,680
lethal temperature 50 values and seeing

1265
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,160
how they might relate to things like

1266
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,960
soil moisture and leaf water potential

1267
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,558
the hypothesis being is that we would

1268
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,519
find lower

1269
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,040
lt50 values in zones of vineyards that

1270
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,960
had

1271
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,318
somewhat lower soil moisture during the

1272
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,199
growing season

1273
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,239
and

1274
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:51,279
lower leaf water potential so maybe

1275
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,439
touching on almost water stress

1276
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,319
and yes indeed we were finding in a lot

1277
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,639
of these vineyards that there was

1278
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:02,000
a relationship between

1279
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:06,799
soil moisture leaf water potential and

1280
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,800
lt 50 in a great many of these vineyards

1281
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,239
oh that's a good question and it

1282
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,880
it's going to differ from

1283
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,399
vineyard to vineyard

1284
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,640
roughly minus

1285
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,440
19 minus 26

1286
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,440
are there abouts

1287
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,319
c yeah c

1288
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,480
and here's another example we can see

1289
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:34,079
this low yielding area

1290
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,880
is also associated with low lt 50 values

1291
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,318
and so we're finding that not just that

1292
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,400
but also

1293
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,800
associated with higher anthocyanins and

1294
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,720
higher phenolics so there's also the

1295
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,400
quality benefit that comes along with

1296
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,719
this

1297
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,639
okay and we're finding that there's a

1298
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,239
temporal effect as well and we're

1299
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:56,400
finding that

1300
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:59,118
a zone of low lt 50 expands as you move

1301
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,559
into winter and as those vines acclimate

1302
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,800
a little bit more

1303
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,240
and then it will shrink again if you're

1304
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,280
starting to

1305
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,719
look at lt 50 values in late february or

1306
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,240
early march so you're seeing that

1307
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,358
de-acclimation

1308
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:17,759
effect and you're seeing a a change in

1309
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,759
the the size of these lt50 patterns

1310
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,960
okay i think i can skip over that one

1311
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,318
and just kind of go over to uh to

1312
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,440
conclusions

1313
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,079
um

1314
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,039
so i would say that geomatics has

1315
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,440
allowed us to to conclude that uh

1316
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,000
uh that this terroir effect is uh

1317
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,480
associated with things such as

1318
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,880
soil and vine water status and uh to

1319
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,039
some extent also

1320
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,519
yield and possibly vine size i think

1321
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,960
those things probably account for a

1322
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,960
large

1323
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,960
percentage of the terroir effect

1324
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:56,960
these technologies have also allowed us

1325
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,800
to to verify and validate

1326
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,000
sub-appellations within the niagara

1327
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,839
region

1328
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,920
and i think that

1329
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,920
coupled with remote sensing we might be

1330
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,559
able to help

1331
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,159
growers delineate and define some

1332
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,559
sub-blocks that they might be able to

1333
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:15,118
use for for economic gain

1334
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,200
i'm hoping that this

1335
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,519
work will also allow us

1336
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,679
over a period of years to

1337
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,159
be able to show growers

1338
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,239
high and low risk

1339
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,078
winter injury areas within their their

1340
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:30,239
vineyard blocks that might mean that

1341
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,640
they can

1342
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,199
cluster thin portions of vineyard blocks

1343
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,279
in order to enhance winter hardiness for

1344
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,519
instance

1345
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,079
i i think the last thing to mention and

1346
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:45,599
that is is that

1347
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,720
any vineyard variable can be mapped

1348
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,920
and

1349
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,959
any

1350
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,960
vineyard variable can be

1351
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,480
uh looked at in terms of its spatial

1352
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,960
variability and in terms of its uh

1353
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,159
spatial correlation with other variables

1354
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,599
so

1355
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,558
whether it's a whole bunch of soil

1356
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,559
variables and things like that you can

1357
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,240
relate those with

1358
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,800
things that are going to

1359
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,838
mean money for you yield fruit

1360
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,640
composition and things of that nature

1361
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,599
so i think with that i better

1362
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:19,838
stop

1363
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,559
i've gone over a few minutes and

1364
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:25,880
i'd like to save some time for questions

1365
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,880
so thank you

1366
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,519
i i don't know if i've

1367
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,519
worked in a vineyard where uh

1368
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,239
i i would see a five dollar section

1369
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:45,599
maybe a fifteen dollar section

1370
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,759
and most definitely there's some

1371
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,039
areas or zones within those vineyards

1372
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,520
where they would

1373
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,519
um

1374
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,240
probably be able to create a 35 or 40

1375
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,160
but yeah i i agree with you i think that

1376
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,719
uh

1377
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:07,279
some effort would have to be made to

1378
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,279
bring up the potential value of that

1379
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,039
low value zone

1380
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,440
before i'd start thinking about

1381
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,480
selling that 40 bottle

1382
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,440
okay

1383
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,760
uh good question with the uh

1384
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,519
um destructive sampling we were usually

1385
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,760
looking at uh

1386
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,759
a rate of um

1387
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:33,280
75 to 100 vines to the hectare

1388
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,599
and uh generally in a

1389
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,440
a grid try to look at it something like

1390
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,800
an eight by eight meter grid or

1391
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,800
something of that nature

1392
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,680
it's a big area yeah

1393
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,480
um

1394
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:51,759
that one block we had uh

1395
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,559
25 acres and we had about 500 vines that

1396
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
we

1397
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,680
took from that

1398
00:53:54,239 --> 00:54:00,558
25 acres so yeah i think you're always

1399
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,558
trying to uh

1400
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:05,279
create that balance between well

1401
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,440
how much have i got time to do

1402
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,599
and

1403
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,440
how detailed can i get

1404
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,400
and make sure that i've got something

1405
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,119
that i have full confidence in

1406
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,280
and so yeah we've we figured around 75

1407
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,000
to 100 per hectare

1408
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,720
or in some cases more well all of all of

1409
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,239
our

1410
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,239
yield maps that was all

1411
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,639
from

1412
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,159
hand harvested

1413
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:34,239
but there was

1414
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,159
that was joe davenport's

1415
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,639
data from washington where she had the

1416
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,078
the machine so that would have been uh

1417
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,239
continuous

1418
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,920
uh that's a good question and that's

1419
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,000
certainly what

1420
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,039
bramley and some of those guys have been

1421
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,358
uh trying to do in australia is to

1422
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,679
do some of these flyovers or

1423
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,838
use greenseeker in order to get

1424
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:56,799
ndvi maps

1425
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,358
and

1426
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,079
associate those with

1427
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:04,318
either yield or or vine size or both and

1428
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,480
and they have been fairly successful in

1429
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,279
doing that

1430
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,199
and

1431
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,800
generally i i skipped over a few of

1432
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:14,239
those slides but uh

1433
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,079
we were quite successful actually in uh

1434
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:21,199
seeing some nice relationships between

1435
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:23,839
ndvi and yield and vine size and uh yeah

1436
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:26,318
so i think that's possible

1437
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:29,920
um there also seem to be some nice

1438
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:32,239
relationships between ndvi and uh

1439
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,880
things like leaf water potential

1440
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,558
and and bricks and uh and color and

1441
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,440
things like that

1442
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,680
the the data that i've seen from our lab

1443
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,159
and and others seem seem to indicate

1444
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,719
that there is a nice correlation there

1445
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,239
so yeah if you can get a green seeker or

1446
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,598
something like that i think you're all

1447
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,598
set okay thank you
