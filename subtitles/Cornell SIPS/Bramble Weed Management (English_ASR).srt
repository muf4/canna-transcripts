1
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:08,879
will

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:11,359
will everybody um

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,320
participating and now without further

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,320
Ado we're going to move into the second

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,839
phase and I'd like to introduce our

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,880
first speaker um Dr David Handley works

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,518
for the University of Maine at the

8
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:33,159
Highmore research farm he he is um is

9
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,799
responsible for vegetable and small

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,799
fruit variety evaluations and integrated

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:41,679
Pest Management strategies and he's been

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,558
a cooperator on this project and I

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,558
really appreciate having him here he's

14
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,439
going to speak to us about cultural

15
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,599
control options for Bramble weed

16
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,198
management and Dr Handley thank you

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,439
Laura well good afternoon um I'm going

18
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,439
to cover the basics of weed management

19
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,039
without chemicals uh we're going to of

20
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,640
course discuss chemicals as uh part of

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,840
the options as we go along but Rich

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,118
banana will'll get into those

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
specifically a little bit later on so to

24
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,799
start off and just to introduce the

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,799
topic we need to understand exactly what

26
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,400
a weed is and what it's doing and and

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,840
how we're going to manage it based on

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,520
that um a weed is basically a plant

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,040
that's in the wrong place at the wrong

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,239
time from your

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,400
perspective this means that it's going

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,919
to compete with those plants for light

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,240
nutrients and water uh given that

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
definition raspberries can actually

35
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,359
become Their Own Worst weed if you're

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,040
not doing a good job of pruning them and

37
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,640
keeping the plant population down for

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,880
they too will compete amongst themselves

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,879
for light nutrients and

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,640
water raspberries create kind of a

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,359
special case for weed management if

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,399
you're used to Growing other crops like

43
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,718
vegetables for example uh that can make

44
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,478
it a little more challenging to get

45
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,438
weeds under control and keep them under

46
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,599
control for one thing they're perennial

47
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,118
and this eliminates the opportunity for

48
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,718
crop rotation in other words you can't

49
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,280
say well it was a bad weed year this

50
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,919
year I'm just going to rotate out and do

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,159
something uh different next year

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
hopefully that planning is going to be

53
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,800
with you for 10 or 20 years in addition

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,879
raspberries are shallow rooted and this

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,360
means that uh they're not really suited

56
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:17,159
to close cultivation because any

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
equipment you have in there disturbing

58
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,919
the top layer of the soil is going to

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,360
harm the roots of the raspberry plant

60
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,799
and also because they're shallow rooted

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,040
they tend to be very poor competitors

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,599
with weeds if you can imagine a grass

63
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,639
for example in a raspberry planting

64
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,359
their roots are in the exact same spot

65
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,199
because over 70% of a Raspberry's root

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,200
system is in the top 8 in of the soil uh

67
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,000
this is also uh an issue with just about

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,439
any uh perennial weed that's going to be

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,560
in there directly competing with them

70
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,239
raspberries are also herbicide sensitive

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,158
especially younger planting so the use

72
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,519
of herbicides has to be carefully

73
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,759
monitored there are only a few chemicals

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
out there that uh will control weeds

75
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,759
without actually harming the raspberry

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,680
plants and Rich will'll talk about this

77
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,840
later so your options are are fairly

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,840
Limited in that regard

79
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,119
so one of the keys of having a

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
successful weed Management program in

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,280
raspberries is to make sure that you get

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,080
off on the right foot and what we're

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
talking about here is pre-plant weed

84
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,239
control this is really the Cornerstone

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,959
of a successful weed Management program

86
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,680
and this should begin anywhere from 1 to

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,640
3 years before you plan to single

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,799
raspberry in the ground depending on

89
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,518
what condition the site is in when you

90
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,159
get started um and when we talk about

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,719
what are we the types of things that

92
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,079
need to go into pre-plant management

93
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,799
we're talking about looking at site

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,480
selection what amendments you're going

95
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,799
to add to that soil and how that's going

96
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,158
to impact weed weeds in the future uh if

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
you're going to use cover crops what

98
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,000
cover crops you're going to use and how

99
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,359
what sort of strategies you're going to

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,318
use with them uh the possibility of

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,000
fallowing before planting in other words

102
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,839
uh keeping that soil bare for a year or

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,919
two to try to deplete the weed seed

104
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,640
population and then as we get ready to

105
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,479
plant using some techniques to keep the

106
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,238
weeds down in that planting year such as

107
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,399
stale seed beds or strip tillage and

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,560
we'll cover each of these in a little

109
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,039
more Tail as we move

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,719
along so looking at site selection

111
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,959
specifically one of the things you want

112
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,239
to do when you decide you're going to

113
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,719
plant raspberries and where you're going

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,959
to plant raspberries is to take a look

115
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,000
at that site and determine what's

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
happened there previously with an ey

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,478
weeds management for example what

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
previous crops have you had there uh

119
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,159
it's going to be a big difference

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,879
whether this was a well tilled and

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
well-managed vegetable planting as

122
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,800
opposed to a neglected pasture for the

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,160
last 20 years in terms of what types of

124
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,000
weeds you're going to be facing and then

125
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
looking at that ground what sort of weed

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,160
history do you know there's a particular

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,319
perennial weed that's been a problem

128
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,000
quack grass or nut Edge for example that

129
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,120
is going to cause a special issue for

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,240
you if you're trying to plant a

131
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,399
perennial crop like raspberries in there

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,879
and then also take a look at the weed

133
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,319
management history again if this has

134
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,639
been a corn field or something where

135
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,240
herbicides have been used in the past

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,720
try to get an idea of what chemicals

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,000
have been used and how recently they've

138
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,039
been used and whether or not there's any

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,439
plant back restrictions that might uh

140
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:55,879
cause a problem with the plants

141
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,759
themselves so not only weeds but the

142
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,800
potential for herbicide residue could be

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,038
an issue for you you want to take a

144
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,919
close look at that site for what

145
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,879
existing weed species there are not only

146
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,000
annual weeds

147
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,839
which might be relatively easy to

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,519
control but especially perennial species

149
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,560
that might be in there that need to be

150
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,560
controlled before we start planting and

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,918
you can develop a strategy to get them

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
out of there before those plants go in

153
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,120
the ground pay special attention to

154
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
whether or not there's wild brambles in

155
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,280
there for the not only the reason that

156
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
these can be a challenging weed to get

157
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,758
rid of but they act as disease hosts

158
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,198
especially viruses and wild brambles

159
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,479
really need to be controlled before you

160
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,600
put any of your cultivated varieties in

161
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,439
there what soil amendments are you going

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
to use we often add soil amendments to

163
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,839
try to build soil organic matter and

164
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,319
improve the nutrient holding capacity of

165
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,959
the soil and soil drainage but if we use

166
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,759
animal manures these can often contain

167
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,399
wheed seed uh horse manure is is popular

168
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
in my area and unfortunately horses are

169
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,519
very poor at processing wheat seed and

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,038
as a result unless the animal manure has

171
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,439
been composted you can be spreading

172
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,879
millions and millions of whe seeds on

173
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,639
your ground as you think you're helping

174
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,918
it uh by trying to get some organic

175
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,240
matter built up one of the ways you can

176
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,680
get around this is to try to compost any

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Manu that you have uh compost however

178
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,519
also can contain weat seed unless it's

179
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,720
properly done it should be finished in

180
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,799
other words that compost should have

181
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,199
been warmed up to at least 140

182
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,199
preferably 150° to kill most of the weed

183
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,960
seeds that's in there and regularly turn

184
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,759
to make sure that there's a uniform

185
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,879
product throughout the other thing I

186
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,439
hate to see is people saying they're

187
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,639
going to put compost on and you walk

188
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,399
over the compost pile and you can see uh

189
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,519
knee high weeds growing on the pile

190
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,478
because it's been sitting there for

191
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,120
several months uh so if you're not going

192
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:32,519
to be able to use the compost right away

193
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,959
you should either turn it regularly or

194
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,359
cover it to make sure that wheat seeds

195
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,560
aren't blown on and start to get

196
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,919
established and then drop their own seed

197
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,918
in there and cause problems in the

198
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,318
future as we move into site preparation

199
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,279
one of the things you may be considering

200
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,919
is cover crops Now cover crops are

201
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,359
typically added to build soil organic

202
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,839
matter but they're also promoted as a

203
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,120
strategy to reduce wheat seeds in there

204
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,239
um while they do improve soil structure

205
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,720
whether or not they reduce wheed

206
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,199
pressure is really up to you and how you

207
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,479
manage those cover crops just saying

208
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,560
you're putting a cover crop on there

209
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:04,680
doesn't mean you're going to get good

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
weed control although cover crops can

211
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,199
shade out some species uh some may

212
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,799
survive quite well beneath the canopy

213
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
you just can't see them there and indeed

214
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
they're shedding seeds and adding to the

215
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,199
wheat seed bank instead of depleting it

216
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,839
as you would like them to do so overall

217
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,840
in discussions with Rich banano who

218
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,478
you'll be hearing from later uh we feel

219
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,000
that unless they're managed very well uh

220
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,038
cover crops can actually have little

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,959
weed little impact on the total weed

222
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,318
seed

223
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,758
population if we use short-term cover

224
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,598
crop CRS in other words two three or

225
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,120
maybe even four crops over a summer and

226
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,839
combine these with repeated tillage

227
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,240
you're much more likely to get some

228
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,799
impact on the weed seed bank over time

229
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,000
the other strategy you can use is toel

230
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,158
let cover crops that have some

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,319
allopathic uh characteristics such as

232
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:49,079
Rye or sudex and these can uh give off

233
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,919
root exudates or chemicals within the

234
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,758
roots that actually inhibit weed seed

235
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:54,478
germination if you're interested in that

236
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,240
I'd suggest you look at some of the

237
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,758
literature that's out there on a lpath

238
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
species and determine whether or not

239
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,840
this is something that's actually going

240
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
to work uh for you and your and the

241
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,198
particular situation that you're

242
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,560
in here are some of the cover crop

243
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,079
options I don't want to spend a lot of

244
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,918
time on this you can go back to this

245
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,158
later uh but these are some of the more

246
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,878
popular crops uh looking at things like

247
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,478
buckwhat for example is very easy to

248
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,240
grow and actually has very good wheed

249
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,519
suppression the problem with buckweed is

250
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,639
doesn't offer you very much in the way

251
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,079
of organic

252
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
matter and if you allow it to go to seed

253
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,038
before you get it down it itself will

254
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,159
actually become one of your worst weed

255
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,839
headaches uh oats are also a very

256
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:31,439
popular one uh the nice thing about oats

257
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,759
is that they winter kill uh so you don't

258
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,639
have to worry about trying to kill them

259
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,559
and having them come back on you um but

260
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,080
uh they don't tend to do a particularly

261
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,399
good job at choking out weeds unless you

262
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,120
seed them very thick uh Dutch white

263
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,639
clover is not one I'm a big fan of but

264
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,879
people like it because it's a legum and

265
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,000
can add some nitrogen to the soil but

266
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,639
you find over time uh it's a little

267
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,240
difficult to establish so that weeds can

268
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,120
come up and kind of get in there and

269
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,320
Seed before the the watch white clover

270
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,959
actually becomes well established uh

271
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,560
also Dutch white clover itself can

272
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,919
become a weed issue uh in and

273
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,278
raspberries just one of the plants that

274
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,759
will happily grow through a mulch red

275
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,480
clover is one I would suggest if you

276
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,439
have a hard pan situation because it's

277
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
very deep rooted and can crack break

278
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,720
open some hard pins but it really takes

279
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,360
two seasons to get established uh annual

280
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,600
Ry grass don't let the name fool you

281
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,480
this one will act as a perennial uh in

282
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,759
some situations but it's one that people

283
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
are starting to look at uh as a good

284
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,799
Miner of soil bringing soils back up uh

285
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,799
to the surface and then reincorporate

286
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,519
them winter eyy is one that gives very

287
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,199
good cover and offers a pretty good

288
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,519
shading and choking out of weed species

289
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,320
but it is winter hardy and it will have

290
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
to be killed either by tilling or using

291
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,760
herbicides in the spring time and then

292
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,399
finally sorghum Sudan is another one

293
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,078
that has some little pathic qualities

294
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,278
this one produces a lot of vegetative

295
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,479
growth and uh you might need special

296
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,240
equipment just to plow it down just

297
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,879
taking a look at a slide here you can

298
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
see the top slide is winter Rye uh even

299
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,639
a good stand of winter Rye unless you've

300
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
got a good mower uh is going to be

301
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,838
difficult to put down in the springtime

302
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
as I said this one will overwinter and

303
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,720
will go to seed and you need to mow it

304
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,278
down

305
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,040
before that seed uh matures on the

306
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,278
bottom slide you see sorghum Sudan again

307
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,879
this isn't something you're going to do

308
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,278
with a hand mower or a weed whacker you

309
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,919
need to have good equipment in a bush

310
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,240
hog to be able to get this down but you

311
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,838
can just see the amount of organic

312
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,240
matter you're working into the soil and

313
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,399
the potential for choking out beeds

314
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,079
there now let's move into getting

315
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,958
actually ready for planting these after

316
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,319
we've hopefully overcome most of the

317
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,958
more serious weed problems uh we can get

318
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,440
ready to uh plant these and we want to

319
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,439
plant them in such a way that we're not

320
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,800
actually encouraging more weed growth uh

321
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,160
one of the ways to do this as we

322
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,039
approach the planting year is to maybe

323
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,240
fow it for the season before planting

324
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,679
and this is just a case of using

325
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,519
repeated tillage throughout the growing

326
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,879
season not allowing anything to grow on

327
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
that soil for an entire season this is a

328
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,480
very good way of depleting the annual

329
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,200
seed bank because you till you bring up

330
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,200
more weed seeds they germinate you till

331
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,680
again before they go to seed you keep

332
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
bringing up more weed seeds and killing

333
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,000
them out before they have a chance to

334
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,799
reproduce you can also get ahead of

335
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,559
perennial weed such as quack grass this

336
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,240
way uh by com uh continually bringing up

337
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,799
the root system dehydrating them not

338
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
allowing them to get ahead of them and

339
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,439
basically dep depleting those plant

340
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,200
reserves in there the problems with

341
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
fallowing is that it's somewhat energy

342
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,519
intensive it can be a little hard on the

343
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
soil structure because you're not really

344
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,679
adding organic matter to that and you're

345
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,399
regularly stirring up the soil breaking

346
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,799
up some of those clouds but if you have

347
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,120
a lot of organic matter in the soil

348
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,159
there shouldn't be too big an issue

349
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,639
doing this for one season erosion of

350
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,000
course is a problem if you're on a slope

351
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,159
for example and water is going to pull

352
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,720
your soil off or if you're in a

353
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,159
particularly windy area you'd be

354
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,440
surprised how much soil it can actually

355
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,439
lose by wind but fallowing is a strategy

356
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
that can work fairly well for uh getting

357
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,399
rid of some uh nasty weed problems

358
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,160
without having to use uh

359
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,440
chemicals as we're getting ready

360
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,759
to plant there are some other strategies

361
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,240
we can use steale seed bed is one that's

362
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,639
popular with vegetable Growers but could

363
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,639
also be used with a perennial crops such

364
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,120
as strawberries or raspberries in this

365
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,919
case we prepare the ground either in the

366
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,480
fall or the early spring all set nice

367
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,439
and tidy ready for planting but in the

368
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,159
spring we allow that soil to sit and

369
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,279
weat Steed starts to germinate I have

370
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,799
two to four weeks here it's probably

371
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,278
more likely 4 to six weeks that you

372
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,879
allow those those weeds to start coming

373
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,958
up but not to the point where they're

374
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,559
going to be uh flowering or or setting

375
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,000
seed then we kill those weeds back

376
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,719
either with a contact herbicide or

377
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,720
flaming we don't disturb the soil

378
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,519
surface in other words we're not

379
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,278
cultivating here we're just killing out

380
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,759
what's on top if we don't dist disturb

381
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,480
the soil surface we're going to prevent

382
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,559
new weed seeds from surfacing and

383
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,320
basically keep that Toof layer of soil

384
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,838
acting somewhat as a mulch then we plant

385
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,720
keeping the soil disturbance to a

386
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,480
minimum so just plant right in the plant

387
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,639
rows the area between your rows which in

388
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,480
the case of raspberries is a good 8 to

389
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,879
12 ft a good bit of soil surface there

390
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,759
uh undisturbed and that should keep your

391
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,360
your weeds under control anywhere from a

392
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,198
few days to weeks depending on how much

393
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,560
rain you get anything else that might

394
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:45,559
disturb the soil surface and how much of

395
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,919
a weed seat Bank you have but still seed

396
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,759
beds can be a good way of getting your

397
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,120
plants off to a good start give you a

398
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,399
few days to a few weeks of relatively

399
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
weed-free uh conditions this is not

400
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,440
going to be true of where you've

401
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Disturbed the soil every place you've

402
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,240
dug a little hole or or dug a trench to

403
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,679
put those plants in you're going to see

404
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,159
weed starting to come up so you will

405
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,599
have to have some other strategy for

406
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,879
that such as hand

407
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,079
pulling strip tillage is another thing

408
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,278
that's being looked at again we're

409
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,958
seeing a lot of this being used uh in in

410
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,799
uh vegetable crops but there's no reason

411
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,879
it couldn't work with uh perennial crops

412
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,159
such as raspberries or strawberries in

413
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,320
this case again we

414
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,399
prepare the ground in the early fall and

415
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,240
in this case we see a cover crop uh the

416
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,799
most popular one is winter Ry but we can

417
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,278
also use annual Ry or oats now this crop

418
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,838
will grow up during the late summer and

419
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,198
fall of that previous year then in the

420
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,320
spring spring time we go through and

421
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:33,639
kill that cover crop now in the case of

422
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Oats they winter kill so we don't have

423
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,720
to worry about it but in the case of the

424
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,799
annual r or the winter R we would

425
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,240
probably have to use a post emerging

426
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,519
contact herbicide choone is typically

427
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,480
used but there might be something like

428
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,000
paraquat as well and Rich can speak to

429
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,079
this a little bit later then without

430
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,639
without barely disturbing that plant

431
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,919
residue we leave the residue there to

432
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,120
act as a mulch we till narrow strips

433
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,360
through the dead cover this does require

434
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,000
specialized equipment I'll show you a

435
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,480
picture of that in a minute and then we

436
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,360
just plant The Raspberries right into

437
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,839
these strips um the dead vegetation

438
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,440
inhibits weed growth it also tends to

439
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,600
keep the soil kind of cold so you may

440
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,040
see that this uh delays a little bit the

441
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,199
emergence of new primocanes and uh root

442
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:14,159
growth uh in your plants but raspberries

443
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,439
are pretty tolerant of cold cold soil

444
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,838
temperature so I don't think this would

445
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,519
be too big a deal here's a picture of a

446
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,079
strip tiller going through uh in this

447
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,799
case it was also a fertilizer injector

448
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,919
on the back of it but what we see here

449
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,078
is that there's just a series of of deep

450
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,479
tillage blades here uh some blades that

451
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,120
go down deep and then a couple of little

452
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,320
couter blades that just roll behind and

453
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,198
bring that stir that soil surface up to

454
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,959
make a a decent planting strip and we

455
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,359
can see the strips here in this case of

456
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,518
course those strips are far closer than

457
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,079
we'd have them in a raspberry situation

458
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,560
uh but you get the idea so this works

459
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,479
fairly well and again that residue is

460
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,559
going to hang around in the case of Rye

461
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,159
it would hang around probably through

462
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,239
most of the planting season in the case

463
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,039
of Oats you'll probably find that

464
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,399
residue will break down by about halfway

465
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,399
through the season

466
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,759
now as we move into the planting year

467
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,879
itself it's important to understand that

468
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,519
we really want no competition uh plant

469
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,799
competition for the raspberries in that

470
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,560
planting year one of the things I hate

471
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,958
to see is going into an established Turf

472
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,359
uh and then carving out some narrow rows

473
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,638
uh with a Rota tiller and then planting

474
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,399
our raspberries into that uh frequently

475
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,839
those uh Turf species are fairly

476
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,320
aggressive and will move back in and

477
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,240
become the predominant plant right over

478
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,680
your raspberries so I really prefer to

479
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,560
see that there be no competition in the

480
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,000
planting year between the rows now we

481
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,119
can keep that area between the rows

482
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,318
clean with shallow cultivation uh or

483
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,759
with flaming there are good flame

484
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:35,198
weeders out there it will have to be

485
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,759
directed so that the Flames aren't going

486
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,039
to burn the the raspberry plants you've

487
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,399
put in there so there'll have to be some

488
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,399
shielding involved and within the rows

489
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,720
we can either use hand pulling uh and

490
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,240
that won't be too big a job if we've

491
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,240
done a good job of pre-plant weed

492
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,600
management or there are some detail

493
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,600
cultivators out there that will do a

494
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,120
reasonably good job between the plants

495
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,040
they won't get get you completely out of

496
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,759
hand weeding but they will help here's

497
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,399
some of those cultivators uh just taking

498
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,600
a look at them uh this is a budding

499
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,039
cultivator that you see here uh what you

500
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,360
see is the plant actually runs through

501
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,759
this series of Wheels with fingers on it

502
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
uh that means that these can get quite

503
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,199
close and these little tines just

504
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,839
disturb the top inch or two of the soil

505
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,278
keeping those weeds down um of course

506
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,880
the toolbar you can see here is set

507
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:15,198
fairly low so this is only going to work

508
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,759
well if you're using plug plants for

509
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,719
your raspberries but also if you use

510
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,240
dormant canes as long as you've cut the

511
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,000
handle off you you'll be able to get a

512
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,440
couple of good weeks of use out of this

513
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,958
the Reggie weer that you see here is

514
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,000
very similar in that we have two

515
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,638
spinning heads with fingers on them down

516
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,559
here that will get rid of a lot of the

517
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,919
weeds and we have handles up here that

518
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,318
we can bring in or out and make those

519
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,439
heads

520
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,679
go closer or further away as we approach

521
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,759
the plants uh this also will work fairly

522
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,159
well again you see we have a little more

523
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,639
clearance here so we'll probably be able

524
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,759
to use this throughout I would guess

525
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,399
most of the planting year um but

526
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,839
there'll still be uh some hand weeding

527
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,519
to do in terms of using cultivators um

528
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,160
between the rows and in the aisleways we

529
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,440
can just use a broad cultivator this is

530
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,600
a l time cultivator does a pretty good

531
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,600
job of just disturbing uh the top inch

532
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,519
or so of the soil does a very good job

533
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
of keeping the weeds down provided that

534
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,880
you're using this before the weeds

535
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,519
actually break the soil surface we call

536
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,079
this blind cultivation you want to get

537
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,558
these weeds under control where they're

538
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,959
still in what we call the white thread

539
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,038
stage before they've actually emerged

540
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,880
from the ground uh so this has to happen

541
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,480
about every 10 to 14 days depending on

542
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,959
how much moisture you're getting just

543
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,959
going through there and raking this uh

544
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,959
over the plants um and here we

545
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,360
see a uh flame weeder there's many

546
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,840
different sorts of this but many heads

547
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,119
on this this could go between the rows

548
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,000
with uh some uh propane tanks in the

549
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,678
back leading to this then it's ignited

550
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and the Flames just go over and burn

551
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,679
them out um again you don't have to

552
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,359
toast the the whole weeds with a flame

553
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
weeder you just need to go over them uh

554
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:47,279
very quickly and the cells will uh

555
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,720
basically explode and and kill those

556
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,079
plants well what about mulch actually

557
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,240
between the rows using that space

558
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,199
between the rows and covering it up with

559
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,519
mulch if we don't want to cultivate um

560
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,798
well if we're using strip tillage the

561
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,319
residue is already there acting as a

562
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,879
mulch so that will help you could apply

563
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,399
straw between the rows but it's going to

564
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
be fairly expensive I would not

565
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
recommend using mulch hay because this

566
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,960
is loaded with wheed seeds and you'll

567
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,080
have a lovely hay crop coming up in your

568
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,919
raspberries the next year um landscape

569
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,399
fabric can also be used but it's very

570
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
expensive and it's hard to maintain

571
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,880
because dust and dirt will be dragged on

572
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,599
there by your equip and so forth in any

573
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,559
place that

574
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,359
H happens you're going to have weed

575
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,960
starting to grow through it it's also

576
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,798
extremely costly the only place I've

577
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,720
seen landscape fabric used to any effect

578
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,798
is under high tunnels I don't think it

579
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,400
really has a place out in the field uh

580
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:33,639
and as I said the cost is very high and

581
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,038
the maintenance can be also quite high

582
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,480
but it is a strategy you can use if

583
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,400
you're only using a small planting to

584
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,640
mulz between the rows I've also heard

585
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,360
people say that they'd like to try to

586
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,038
get some row crops between there such as

587
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,798
beans um or one of these other vegetable

588
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,919
crops uh these these can be used again

589
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,240
as long as you're keeping them far

590
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,000
enough away and you don't feel that

591
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,720
they're going to be uh competitive with

592
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,960
the raspberries

593
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,319
themselves well what about within the

594
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,360
row uh within the row mulch is also an

595
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,759
option uh straw can be used this has

596
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,839
actually uh been shown to be very

597
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,279
helpful especially around plug plants

598
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,079
however I say this with an important

599
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,359
caveat the straw does need to be removed

600
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,599
in the fall so we can put it over the

601
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,000
plants right after planting in the

602
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,480
spring but we do need to remove it in

603
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,759
the fall the reason for this is that

604
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,400
through the winter and in the early

605
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,038
following spring what'll happen is it

606
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,320
keeps the soil very cold and wet and

607
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,359
tends to make some plants very

608
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,519
susceptible to phost Marvin pritz did a

609
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,839
nice study on this a few years back so

610
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,279
what I would recommend is go ahead and

611
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,079
use straw around the plants to try to

612
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,319
keep weeds from around growing right

613
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,119
around the plants if you will but

614
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,038
remember to take it off uh because you

615
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,759
want that soil to dry out as quickly as

616
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,038
possible in the spring using raised beds

617
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,558
can also help you in this situation wood

618
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,960
chips and shavings can also be used

619
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,440
they're a little bit heavy for using in

620
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,919
the planting year and they will delay

621
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,320
the emergence of the Prime canes but if

622
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,080
you feel that you've got a long growing

623
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,240
season ahead of you and you've got nice

624
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,439
vigorous plants a light application of

625
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,120
wood chips or shavings could be helpful

626
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,919
I'm not a big fan of sawdust sawdust

627
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,079
tends to be have too fine a particulate

628
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,600
in it it tends to crust and as a result

629
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,639
of that you'll find that the water has a

630
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,639
very uh does

631
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,559
not penetrate very well through sawdust

632
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
in fact it'll bounce right off and water

633
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,440
uh the Weeds on the sides so what I

634
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,120
would recommend is if you're going to

635
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,679
use sawdust blend it with some wood

636
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,918
chips or shavings or try to help that

637
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,798
way if you've got a source of good clean

638
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,200
compost uh this can be used as a mulch

639
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,240
and you can see that in the lower slide

640
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,960
here I've tried this myself uh and we

641
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,400
got very good weed control throughout

642
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,720
most of the first growing season the

643
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,120
problem with compost of course is it's

644
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,038
actually a pretty good metor for plants

645
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,239
to grow on so if you had a lot have a

646
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,720
lot of weed seeds blowing in uh it can

647
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,400
result in some problems for you but if

648
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,079
the mulch itself if the compass itself

649
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,480
is quite clean and you don't have a lot

650
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,000
of wheat seeds blowing in this can

651
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,519
actually provide a good surface cover

652
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
cover up any wheat seeds that are in the

653
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,839
soil uh and also over time as it's

654
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,960
breaking down provide nutrients for

655
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,079
those growing plants I often get

656
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,840
questions about uh using pine needles or

657
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,199
leaves or these sorts of things usually

658
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,759
if we've got a big planning the issue

659
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,919
here is with Supply and cost is it

660
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,319
really worth your time to go and rake

661
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,200
all those things out pine needles are a

662
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,319
great mulch they'll work terrific uh but

663
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,798
the question is whether or not you can

664
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,279
get enough of them um leaves I'm not so

665
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,720
fond of unless they've been broken up

666
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,279
because they tend to again mat down

667
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,558
around the plant keep it wet and can

668
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,798
lead to phyto problems as opposed to

669
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,599
pineals which are nice pores and D can

670
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,000
Qui oh there you're going to talk about

671
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,439
it here I was just going to talk about

672
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,200
yeah and and Molly shw I'm approaching

673
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
plastic mulch folks I'm not forgetting

674
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,880
leaving the mulch in place if you're

675
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
planting on ridges or raised

676
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,519
beds okay with with straw I would say no

677
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,240
the the evidence is pretty clear that

678
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,158
straw mulch uh just is is really bad as

679
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,880
as far as phyter is concerned if you're

680
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
using something that's more porous and

681
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,000
allows uh air through it so it will warm

682
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,359
up more quickly such as the shavings uh

683
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,119
that we talked about I would say

684
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,759
okay okay uh but straw mulch in my

685
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,278
opinion is fine for the planting year

686
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,960
but even with raised beds I would be

687
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:51,240
inclined to take it off uh the year

688
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,278
after that unless of course you feel

689
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,558
it's broken down if it's degraded enough

690
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,919
that it's not really going to be causing

691
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,079
you any issues in that case you could

692
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,559
probably leave it

693
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,960
on well what about plastic we get this

694
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,319
question a lot about using plastic mulch

695
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,440
uh first and foremost it's a little bit

696
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,119
expensive uh you're looking at something

697
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,759
between anywhere depending on what types

698
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,839
of plastic you use $600 to $1,000 an

699
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,960
acre um actually I should pull that back

700
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,480
it would be a little bit less than that

701
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,240
because you're using uh you're not using

702
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,519
quite as much in a raspberry planting it

703
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,919
really depends on what sort of plastic

704
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,798
you're using and how long you want that

705
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,600
plastic to last um what we have found

706
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,119
with shallow rooted perennial plants

707
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,000
like raspberries and blueberries that we

708
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,519
do get a little inhibition of of roots

709
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,919
right near the surface of the soil and

710
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,000
we think this is because the temperature

711
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,278
gradient under the mulch is a little bit

712
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,599
different than it would be under bare

713
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:39,000
soil but overall it doesn't seem to have

714
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,959
a huge impact on plant growth it will

715
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,599
inhibit primocane growth if you just lay

716
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,200
black plastic out there punch some holes

717
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,759
in it and plant through those holes

718
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,759
remember that your new Primal canes are

719
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,200
going to be coming up uh from root buds

720
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,519
further away from those initially

721
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,759
planted uh crowns so after those plants

722
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,319
have been in for a couple of weeks you

723
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,079
will need to run a slit down the middle

724
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,798
or maybe cut out a strip about a foot a

725
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,000
foot and a half wide to allow those new

726
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,519
primocanes to come up uh or else you're

727
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,038
not going to get good plant growth from

728
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,519
there now the biodegradable mulch may

729
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,679
offer a good answer here and that you

730
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,960
can put these mulches down uh and then

731
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,559
they will start to degrade the problem

732
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,679
with these so far is that they're

733
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,759
usually designed to last perhaps a

734
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,519
little bit longer uh than we'd want them

735
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,119
to in order to get those Pines up and

736
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,158
growing earlier so you'd want to take a

737
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,639
look at the

738
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,039
biodegradable Moes are usually rated on

739
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,038
how long they will last before they

740
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,480
start to degrade and you may want to go

741
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:31,240
with one that will start to degrade

742
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
relatively early bear in mind that

743
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,679
they're going to degrade all the way

744
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,159
they are they aren't going to give you

745
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,519
protection on the edges like you'd see

746
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,799
with the more permanent mulches you see

747
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,918
in this picture this is actually under a

748
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:41,639
high tunnel in California and the

749
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,799
biodegradable types are more expensive

750
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,480
right now they're somewhere between two

751
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,679
or three times the cost of the regular

752
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,038
black plastic mes but black plastic can

753
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,519
be used just bear in mind that you've

754
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,919
got to make room for those Primal canes

755
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,879
to come up and that it's going to be a

756
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,360
little pricey but it may be a cheap way

757
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,440
out if you consider how much it cost you

758
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,439
to go through there and do hand weeding

759
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,439
okay now let's move into actually the

760
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,440
years after planting as we move into

761
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,919
years 2 3 4 and five as we're getting

762
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
this planting established there are some

763
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,200
options for we control as we move

764
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,960
through here one of the options is to

765
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,960
keep this clean cultivated and this is

766
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,880
the way that a lot of the uh Growers

767
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,200
handle this in the larger R raspberry

768
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,640
growing regions of the country where the

769
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,840
crop is mostly harvested for processing

770
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640
how can we keep those uh weeds down in

771
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,439
the areas but both in the Iowa and in

772
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,880
the row well frequent light tillage as

773
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,919
we've already talked about uh in the

774
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,480
planting year using flamers uh is

775
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,840
another way to do it again it' have to

776
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,399
be directed so that we're not burning

777
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,599
the plants them the raspberry plants

778
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,158
themselves hand pulling practical in the

779
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,199
row I don't think it's very practical in

780
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,039
the ale ways there um and of course just

781
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,319
the idea of clean cultivation here is

782
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,839
fairly going to be energy intensive it's

783
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,200
going to be difficult with perennials

784
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,798
especially if you've got one that snuck

785
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,880
in there or was already established in

786
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:51,359
there before you got planted uh erosion

787
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,399
is going to be a problem for you here

788
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,599
again if you're on a slope or

789
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,000
susceptible to wind and dust can also be

790
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,038
an issue if you're cultivating in there

791
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,759
when the fruit are ripe you're going to

792
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,398
have some dust issues on there the other

793
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,440
issue we have with dust if your planting

794
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,639
is quite Dusty it tends to be a real

795
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,399
attraction for two- spotted spider mines

796
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,240
uh so something else to keep in mind but

797
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:12,519
a possibility if you think you've got

798
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,558
the equipment and time to manage this

799
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,319
another way of going at this is looking

800
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,720
at using clean cultivation in the summer

801
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,798
but then planting a fall Co cover crop

802
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,640
so as we talked about in the previous

803
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,038
slide during the the summertime we would

804
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,120
use frequent light tillage to keep the

805
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,440
weeds out then we would seed a crop of

806
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,558
oats in the late summer or early fall

807
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,240
about the time we're finishing up

808
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:33,558
Harvest of our summer our florane

809
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,839
bearing varieties the oats will

810
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:37,440
winterkill and then the residue acts as

811
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,678
a mulch in the spring similar to what we

812
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,798
talked about with strip tillage summer

813
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,200
tillage is still going to be needed

814
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,960
because the oat residue will probably

815
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
break down uh and weeds will start to

816
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,360
grow through it before the end of the

817
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,319
season so you'll probably find you have

818
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,558
to till one or two times uh before you

819
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,639
could reced the oats next year bear in

820
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:52,918
mind if you're going to grow oats you

821
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,240
are going to have to put some fertilizer

822
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,960
down there for them in order to get them

823
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,960
established you can't just keep planting

824
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,840
them and expect them to do well this

825
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,200
might not be practical for Primal

826
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,639
fruiting varieties because you're going

827
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,880
to be seeding those oats and having it

828
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,799
come up about the same time that you

829
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,960
need to be in there doing harvesting and

830
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,960
other operations so you may not be able

831
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,480
to establish a good uh cover crop in

832
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,360
there with the prime fter but this is

833
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,519
something to be looked at uh Dr pritz

834
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,918
has done quite a bit of work with this

835
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,440
and strawberries and found it that it

836
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,000
can work very well there I don't see any

837
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,558
reason why we couldn't uh exp expand

838
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,200
that into raspberry production as

839
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,319
well but what is most commonly done here

840
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,319
in the Northeast is using a living mulch

841
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:32,038
between the rows and this is just a turf

842
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,918
grass established in those aisleways but

843
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,960
not allowed to get into the plant rows

844
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,559
themselves so we leave about a 3 to 5

845
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,720
foot strip a bare strip in the plant

846
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,240
rows so I point that out here so this

847
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,240
area in here has no grass growing in it

848
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,440
or so we hope and then the aisleways

849
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,000
themselves have a perennial grass

850
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,679
species growing in

851
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,480
them now I don't want to see this uh put

852
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,640
in prior to the plant going in as I said

853
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,919
I don't want any competition in the

854
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,759
planting here so generally what I

855
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,960
recommend is that this be sewn in the in

856
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,440
August or September of the planting year

857
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,759
or sewn in the following spring

858
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,000
generally what we want to see used here

859
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,960
is a weak perennial grass species such

860
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,679
as a non- creeping hard Fescue or

861
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,240
perennial rye or a mix of those two um

862
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,720
these are slow growing they tend to be

863
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,159
slow to establish so we have to be

864
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,079
patient with them and we may have to

865
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,480
control weeds coming up through them but

866
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,158
if they have enough uh nitrogen

867
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,519
eventually they will uh cover the crop

868
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,520
pretty well and be able to out compete

869
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,240
most of the weeds that are coming in we

870
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,119
don't want to use a conservation mix or

871
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,558
a contractor's mix or a pasture mix

872
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,798
because these contain very aggressive

873
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,678
ramous grass species that will quickly

874
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,158
become your worst weed problem I also

875
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:35,880
don't really care to use Clover I know

876
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,039
it does add nitrogen to the soil but

877
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,760
Clover can also become a weed problem uh

878
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,158
it will grow through mulch so it is

879
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,038
difficult that way and it can also uh

880
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,440
carry some uh diseases that they will

881
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,599
share with raspberry such as filium and

882
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,000
tomato ringspot fires uh believe me

883
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,240
Clover is going to come in on its own I

884
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,159
don't panic too much about trying to

885
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,599
control it but I certainly don't like uh

886
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,159
seeding it in there now once we have

887
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,879
this established it should be moded

888
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,278
regly to make sure that any weeds that

889
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,640
are in amongst that grass is not allowed

890
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,278
to grow up and shed seed uh so if we

891
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,880
keep this grass mowed quite tight the

892
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,398
grass Will Survive and the weeds will

893
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,399
eventually be

894
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,440
depleted as we move on uh to just

895
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,120
looking at this here we are seeing a

896
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,360
crop that's been seated in the

897
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:23,678
establishment year um you can see

898
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,319
here here I've got uh grass just

899
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,919
starting to come up I've mulched between

900
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,119
the rows uh this is a little heavy for

901
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,440
what I'd like to see in the planting

902
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,959
here but the it's doing fairly well

903
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,038
please note the trickle irrigation line

904
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
that's a awful nice thing to have in uh

905
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,319
raspberries really helps them go as we

906
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,519
move into the spring of the second year

907
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,918
in this slide again you can see the

908
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,440
grass getting well established you can

909
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,159
see that nice interface between the

910
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,399
grass and the mulch the grass is not

911
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,039
encroaching in of course you can see the

912
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:46,678
Clover is coming in on its

913
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,079
own

914
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,840
okay and then what about mulch in the

915
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,918
rows within the rows again just like we

916
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,519
talked about in the planting year wood

917
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,278
chips and shavings once those plants are

918
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,919
established a good thick layer will do a

919
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,359
pretty good job we don't want don't want

920
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,960
to use an old pile that has lots of

921
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,119
wheed seed in it but a good fresh pile

922
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,240
of wood chips will help this should be 4

923
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,839
to 8 in thick we can add to this as

924
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,120
needed because it will break down over

925
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,839
time and yes mulch does have some impact

926
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,278
on fertility it will deplete the soil of

927
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,359
the nitrogen right at the soil surface

928
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,440
and it can drop your pH but this can

929
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,000
easily be compensated for by having a

930
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
soil test see what you need to add for

931
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
fertilizer see what you need to

932
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,159
occasionally add for lime over the top

933
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,798
and you can compensate for any impact on

934
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,960
the soil fertility that this mulch might

935
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,599
be having um and overall this is

936
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,640
probably the best way to control weeds

937
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,558
in the planting during those early years

938
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,480
of

939
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,158
establishment and then as we look at the

940
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,319
annual maintenance of this as we finish

941
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,840
up here um we keep our grass aisles mow

942
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,278
tight as I said to prevent any weeds

943
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,278
from starting to come up and germinate

944
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,679
that don't over fertilize those aisles

945
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,079
we do need a little nitrogen to keep

946
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,880
that grass growing and to prevent other

947
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,240
weeds from coming in but if you over

948
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,080
fertilize them they will become more

949
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,200
aggressive uh and try to get into that

950
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,359
plant again you're going to have to mow

951
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,519
more you need to control encroachment

952
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,319
those grasses will try to move in on the

953
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,759
raspberry borders and you can do this

954
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,398
either

955
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,798
with herbicide strips or with uh

956
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,558
shielded flamers uh or just with an

957
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,440
edging tool for the grass now this will

958
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,678
hurt the raspberry Roots a bit but if

959
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,840
you're out far enough it shouldn't have

960
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,360
a big impact on them uh we need to

961
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,839
replenish The Mulch occasionally just

962
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,439
take a look at it each fall and spring

963
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:18,158
see if you need to add another inch next

964
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,759
year but over time you'll find as these

965
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,000
raspberries come thick and established

966
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,558
as you see in this light they do a

967
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,038
pretty good job of shading out most of

968
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,960
the weeds that are coming in there and

969
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:28,440
you may find that you can allow that

970
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,038
mulch to get depleted fairly well and uh

971
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,960
then it won't be have that cooling

972
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,599
effect on the soil that delays emergence

973
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,120
of the primocanes in the spring don't be

974
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,599
fooled some hand weeding is still going

975
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,398
to be necessary and it's important to

976
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,519
keep the area around your planting mode

977
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:43,959
as well um because if you're busy mowing

978
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:45,519
in here and keeping the weed seeds down

979
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,840
but they're blowing in from the unmowed

980
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,278
area around your raspberries you're

981
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:52,119
still going to have weed

982
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,480
problems so in summary with our our

983
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,879
non-chemical weed control uh bear in

984
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,399
mind that the average bed life of a

985
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,600
raspberry planting is 10 to 15 years uh

986
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,199
however I've been in plantings that are

987
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,119
20 25 years old the most common reason

988
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,679
for early bed failure in raspberries is

989
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:08,398
weeds period uh we talk about insects we

990
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,200
talk about diseases but weeds are really

991
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,638
the reason that of raspberry planting

992
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,278
becomes non-viable economically your

993
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,719
paths to success we're making sure that

994
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:17,759
your raspberries are not going to fall

995
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,120
victim to weeds good pre-plant

996
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,599
preparation as we talked about regular

997
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,158
cultivation using mulch in the rows can

998
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,798
help hand pulling is going to be

999
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,440
necessary and of course vigilance

1000
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,319
keeping an eye on the weed situation as

1001
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,159
it develops don't allow any particular

1002
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,439
weed species to get ahead of you walk

1003
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:34,639
through that planting if something is

1004
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,639
starting to develop control it before it

1005
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:41,079
becomes uh throughout your planting I

1006
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:43,798
just point out this this last slide

1007
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,158
here uh I I always find it amusing to be

1008
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,599
in a raspberry planting like this where

1009
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,120
the weeds are up to my chest but the

1010
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:51,398
grower has diligently put a a Japanese

1011
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,000
beetle trap on the end of the row um

1012
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:54,558
believe me his problem is not Japanese

1013
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,319
beetles at this point he's losing a lot

1014
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,759
more money to those weeds than anything

1015
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,599
The Beetles are doing

1016
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,440
and with that actually we have a minute

1017
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,959
or two do you want me to take questions

1018
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,759
now or Dr Handley this would be a great

1019
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,278
time and if you he'll still be there at

1020
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,720
the end of Dr bonano so if you think of

1021
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:15,159
it then you can ask him but just type

1022
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,600
your question into the chat

1023
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:21,200
box and while um we're waiting for

1024
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,638
people to do

1025
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,639
that I'm going to change the

1026
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:28,638
presentation here

1027
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,480
I hope I answered your questions about

1028
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,199
the degradable mulch I don't know of

1029
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,440
anyone who's actually been working with

1030
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,600
degradable mulch other than a few

1031
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,038
Growers who have been trying it uh I do

1032
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,558
think it holds a lot of promise for

1033
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,240
raspberries and and uh my suggestion at

1034
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,678
this point is uh if you're interested in

1035
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,159
the plastic mulches you can find a

1036
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,519
source at a reasonable price give it a

1037
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,480
try uh it looks it looks promising to me

1038
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,679
my only worry is again that it won't

1039
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,200
degrade in time to allow those Prime to

1040
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,120
easily come up through in guards to the

1041
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,840
raised ridges I I do I do like

1042
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,278
raspberries being planted on raised beds

1043
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,959
I think it's an ideal situation for

1044
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,398
raspberries because it really helps

1045
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,519
Define where the raspberries end in your

1046
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,158
isway should begin and that is very

1047
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,000
helpful as part of your weed management

1048
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,519
plan and it also will help with things

1049
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,200
like phyter but just be aware that uh

1050
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,798
straw mulch can be if a thick straw

1051
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,200
mulch layer is on there in the

1052
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,158
spring time it's keeping those roots wet

1053
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,679
it's keeping those roots cold even on

1054
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,360
raised beds it could be an issue if

1055
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:30,798
you're in an area

1056
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,278
we we tried the biodegradable mulch with

1057
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,558
a few Growers and had very mixed results

1058
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,359
um some people thought that you know

1059
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:39,558
they were very encouraged by it and then

1060
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,959
we had other folks that hated it so it

1061
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:46,000
was interesting oh there is one question

1062
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,000
about the best time to put Mulch

1063
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,120
on in the planting year uh in my opinion

1064
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,038
if you're using straw you can put it on

1065
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,359
right away it's so light and fluffy that

1066
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,440
it will provide some weed control if

1067
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,479
you're with a heavier mulch uh like the

1068
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,120
uh wood chips I would probably wait

1069
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,919
until your Primal canes have started to

1070
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:07,319
emerge because if you put it on real

1071
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,320
thick right off the bat you're going to

1072
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,159
delay that primalan emergence so I'd

1073
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,519
probably be putting it on Midsummer time

1074
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,878
as we're moving toward the fall and

1075
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,358
until that time you're going to have to

1076
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:19,440
thank you very much Dr Handley um I'm

1077
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,119
going to if you turn off your uh speaker

1078
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,679
or your microphone well I'm going to

1079
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,240
introduce uh Dr Rich banano who is the

1080
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,358
weed um management specialist for

1081
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,678
vegetable and fruit crops at the

1082
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,519
University of

1083
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,398
Massachusetts and um uh Rich if you are

1084
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,480
right there I'll have you come on and

1085
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,480
you can just take it from

1086
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:49,838
here we can thank you I am here can you

1087
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:54,199
hear me can you hear okay great

1088
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:57,480
hello okay great okay so I'm

1089
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,559
here okay so what I'm going to do is is

1090
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,920
uh uh sort of pick up where David left

1091
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,559
off and talk some about uh uh how

1092
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,240
herbicides fit into this and and we'll

1093
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,759
go through a number of different slides

1094
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,078
here including some uh slides on

1095
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,200
different weed species so Bramble floor

1096
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,640
management David really uh talked about

1097
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:18,919
two different areas one is um between

1098
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:24,159
the rows and also in the row and

1099
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:26,119
um what we um um are looking at is uh

1100
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,799
mostly herbicides being used in the row

1101
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,358
between the row as David mentioned is

1102
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,039
always cultivation uh or some sort of uh

1103
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:35,319
living mulch uh how wide of a middle

1104
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,639
David mentioned 3 to 5 ft and really

1105
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,960
what it comes down to is um research has

1106
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,759
demonstrated that there's always a

1107
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,760
benefit from having as much weed-free

1108
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,240
area or cover crop area as possible but

1109
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,760
there's some sort of practical uh mix

1110
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,318
there where um you want to have u a weed

1111
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,280
free area in the crop row but there's

1112
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,800
issues related to trafficability whether

1113
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,960
it's customers walking up and down down

1114
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,359
or whether it's attractive moving um so

1115
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,440
most people do have something planted uh

1116
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:07,838
between uh the crop rows

1117
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,358
um some people will plant something

1118
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,719
there but if they don't want to mow it

1119
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,119
all the time because of energy

1120
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,439
constraints uh you can use low rates of

1121
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,400
something like Roundup uh a very low

1122
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,720
rate something like 4 or 8 ounces per

1123
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,240
acre uh to go in and kind of hurt the

1124
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,358
cover crop and in the wintertime excuse

1125
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,358
me in the in the in the spring and it

1126
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,039
doesn't have a lot of competition uh in

1127
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,400
the summertime you won't have to it very

1128
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,599
much but it still uh is there and it's

1129
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,559
and it's growing uh so why do you want

1130
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,960
to maintain a weed free strip in the row

1131
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,599
David covered a lot of this but

1132
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,280
basically it's competition uh broad

1133
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,920
leaves are competitive grasses are

1134
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,200
incredibly competitive because they have

1135
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,358
a very shallow root system and and

1136
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,919
compete most aggressively with those uh

1137
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:51,679
shallow uh uh roots that are there from

1138
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,519
the from the Bramble planting and of

1139
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,960
course weeds Harbor insects diseases and

1140
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,519
unwanted animals and sometimes they can

1141
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,639
be allopathic effects of weeds even to

1142
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,960
the Bramble

1143
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,199
planting so we look at weed species

1144
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,400
there's a number of different species

1145
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,358
that are going to be out there and they

1146
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,559
include summer annual weeds winter

1147
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:11,799
annual weeds bals and then various

1148
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:14,400
perennials so summer annual weeds are

1149
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,599
more of a problem in new plantings uh

1150
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,119
especially when you're going from an

1151
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,000
annual culture system maybe vegetables

1152
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,880
or um even strawberries for that matter

1153
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,440
into uh something like brambles uh they

1154
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,480
are very easy to control though with

1155
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,720
many of the residual herbicides and and

1156
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,358
uh some people especially in other fruit

1157
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:36,799
plantings tree fruit plantings

1158
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:39,400
blueberries uh are very into total

1159
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,760
postemergence controls uh even grape

1160
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,440
Growers I've seen people just use

1161
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,440
multiple applications of Roundup one of

1162
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,800
the things that is of benefit when you

1163
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,119
are looking at a total post emergence we

1164
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,560
control option is the presence of bark

1165
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,960
bark is what allows you to make multiple

1166
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,559
applications of Roundup and and to worry

1167
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,960
a lot about residual herbicides but with

1168
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,759
something like brambles where you're

1169
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,920
always talking about these canes coming

1170
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,359
up nothing is really ever more than a

1171
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,240
year or so old you never really have

1172
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:12,880
bark developing there's always green

1173
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,679
tissue there postemergence only control

1174
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,800
practices are not what I recommend I

1175
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,679
think residual materials are important

1176
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,560
and post emergence should be really to

1177
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,799
help uh clean up

1178
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,559
problems so some of the these are some

1179
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,480
summer annual weeds they include things

1180
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:28,759
that you've commonly seen common Lambs

1181
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,679
quars common

1182
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,720
Ragweed um uh also many summer anual

1183
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,358
grasses like crab grass for example in

1184
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,639
panacom and so forth uh winter annual

1185
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,639
weeds uh can be a problem for many years

1186
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:44,598
into a planting especially if seed

1187
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,480
production is allowed now contrary to

1188
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,519
Summer annual weeds that germinate in

1189
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,719
the spring and set their seeds and drop

1190
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,920
their seeds in the fall winter annual

1191
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:57,559
weeds germinate in late summer or early

1192
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,519
fall grow through the winter or or basic

1193
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,358
Al stay dormant in the winter time and

1194
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,519
then produce seeds the following spring

1195
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:06,400
one of the problems with a lot of winter

1196
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,079
annual weeds being out there or any

1197
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,280
cover for that matter being out there in

1198
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,880
the wintertime is the increased

1199
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,960
potential for frost damage the cleaner

1200
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,559
soil is under the crop the more that

1201
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,400
soil will warm up and the less impact on

1202
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:23,960
uh that Frost uh damage might have uh so

1203
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,000
just something to keep in mind in terms

1204
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,440
of how clean you want that cover to be

1205
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,838
under those under that crop in the

1206
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,720
winter time um and also if you have a

1207
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,559
lot of winter annual weeds growing and

1208
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:35,879
you're trying to put a residual material

1209
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,159
down in the spring a residual herbicide

1210
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,838
a lot of that herbicide will be

1211
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,799
intercepted by the leaves of that

1212
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:42,599
growing winter annual so it can cause a

1213
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,318
problem with getting the herbicides to

1214
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,400
work very well so some common uh winter

1215
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:49,838
annual weeds include chickweed field

1216
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,639
pansy henbit and again all these weeds

1217
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,039
usually start to germinate after Labor

1218
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,078
Day um and they can germinate even

1219
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,960
through uh mid to late October depending

1220
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,680
on the season uh bals are a different

1221
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,599
kind of species they actually live for

1222
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:05,719
two full growing Seasons uh they grow

1223
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,240
vegetatively in year one they produce

1224
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:11,199
seed in year two but it's usually a full

1225
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,838
two-year growing season but they from a

1226
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,838
practical standpoint they cause a lot of

1227
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,000
the same problems as do winter annuals

1228
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,799
uh an example of a winter annual uh weed

1229
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,920
is uh berock or excuse me a banial wheed

1230
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,280
is is

1231
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,000
burdock so perennial weeds come in a lot

1232
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,560
of different varieties and shapes uh

1233
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,400
simple perennials like gandel lines uh

1234
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,799
that just have a Tap Root creeping

1235
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,358
perennials uh which are usually Vining

1236
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,079
type perennial weeds that have an

1237
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:40,759
underground ryone system and of course

1238
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,880
grasses uh common dandelion a Tap Root

1239
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:47,680
produces reproduces primarily by seed

1240
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:50,880
and uh does not spread vegetatively um

1241
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:53,919
for the most part in in plantings uh a

1242
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,079
lot of Vining perennial weeds they

1243
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,720
reproduce by romes that grow underneath

1244
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,960
the ground and and come up in various

1245
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,919
places one of the hardest problems to

1246
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,039
deal with with Vining perennial weeds

1247
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,639
like field Bine weed is that they tend

1248
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,199
to come up in the spring and will tend

1249
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,400
to grow up into the planting so even if

1250
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,759
you wanted to say for example apply

1251
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,000
Roundup in the fall to control these

1252
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,480
weeds many times they're they're up into

1253
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,920
the planting of the crop and it's very

1254
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,280
difficult to make a postemergence

1255
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,880
application uh without also uh hurting U

1256
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,000
the Bramble crop quack grass is an

1257
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,920
example of a

1258
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,119
perennial grass and if I can remember

1259
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,838
how to use the pointer here uh what's

1260
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,559
specific about perennials is that you

1261
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,719
not only have this these small fibrous

1262
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,920
Roots which are um uh right close to the

1263
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,559
plant but you also have uh these romes

1264
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,519
which is sort of the spaghetti looking

1265
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,838
things that are sticking out and it is

1266
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:52,519
from these ryom that the new plants uh

1267
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,078
uh can continue to grow uh one of the

1268
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,519
one of the key characteristics of quack

1269
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,640
grass of course is it has these little

1270
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,119
oracles and it's one way to tell it from

1271
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:00,559
a lot of the other grasses there to know

1272
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,318
you really have quack grass and that you

1273
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:07,039
have a perennial species uh to deal

1274
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:09,199
with okay so uh for inro weed management

1275
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,559
we're looking at uh pre-plant and David

1276
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,838
covered a lot of that uh cultural weed

1277
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,358
management um mulches and so forth David

1278
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:18,639
covered physical weed management

1279
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:19,838
cultivation and hand weeding and and

1280
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,078
chemical so we're going to talk a little

1281
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:25,599
bit about chemical uh and and uh and

1282
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,359
about pre-plant as well so just a little

1283
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,119
bit about herbicides and selecting the

1284
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,679
proper herbicide you should really know

1285
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,880
what weed species you have do you have

1286
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:35,318
an annual weed or a perennial weed is it

1287
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,480
a grass weed or is it a broadleaf weed

1288
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,199
the age of the planting matters uh if

1289
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,159
it's a new planting or it's one that's

1290
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,960
established especially with new

1291
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,920
plantings and especially if you're using

1292
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,599
tissue culture plants you have to be

1293
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,639
very careful on what herbicides you

1294
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,200
might want to use the first year um the

1295
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:53,558
older the planting is the more they're

1296
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:56,799
able to handle herbicide applications

1297
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:59,160
soil type limitations some materials say

1298
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,880
um not to use them on very Sandy soils

1299
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,199
or very grally soils and then also the

1300
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,000
time of year is important because most

1301
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,519
of these applications will go on in the

1302
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
spring uh prior to um a a lot of growing

1303
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:15,239
of the of the

1304
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,159
crop okay uh so to select the proper

1305
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,719
rate of a soil applied herbicide

1306
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,358
whenever you're applying an herbicide to

1307
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,399
the soil to prevent weeds from coming up

1308
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,960
the rate of that herbicide is dependent

1309
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,000
on the type of soil you have so the more

1310
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,838
Sandy the soil the lower the rate the

1311
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,639
heavier the soil the higher the rate

1312
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:34,239
also it's based on organic matter less

1313
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,920
organic matter equals less of an

1314
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,039
herbicide rate a higher percent organic

1315
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,639
matter would give you more of an

1316
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:41,279
herbicide rate and this would be listed

1317
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,318
on the label so something just to look

1318
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,599
for if you're using a postemergence

1319
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:48,719
material something like gmox or Roundup

1320
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:50,720
or post or fusilade and we'll get into

1321
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,439
these materials in a minute then it's

1322
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:55,959
really what species do you have and

1323
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,200
sometimes also the size so more material

1324
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,199
might be required to control a larger

1325
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:03,879
weed uh than a smaller

1326
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,558
weed okay so some general guidelines

1327
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,200
about control about applying herbicides

1328
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,319
generally we're looking that all

1329
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,199
applications that are made to the crop

1330
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:15,000
row should be directed to the soil or to

1331
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,679
the weeds at the base of the canes and

1332
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,838
they should avoid green tissue now if

1333
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:23,078
you're using a residual material a soil

1334
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,838
applied material it's usually acceptable

1335
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,760
that you might hit the base of the canes

1336
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:28,558
a little bit uh you're going on in the

1337
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,400
spring before you get a lot of new canes

1338
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,400
coming up or really any new canes coming

1339
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,400
up and you are going to be usually

1340
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,800
applying the material from both Sid so

1341
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,519
you're going to be walking down one side

1342
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,318
of the row coming back on the other side

1343
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,679
of the row so one of the things you want

1344
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,679
to be conscious of is overlap you want

1345
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,799
to make sure that you're not shooting

1346
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,199
the herbicide to the other side as

1347
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,720
you're walking down one side and then

1348
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:51,078
coming back and doing the same thing

1349
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:53,039
because right in the center of the row

1350
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,359
you'll end up with a double rate so

1351
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,920
whatever nozzle setup you use whether

1352
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,679
it's an offset nozzle whether it's a

1353
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,599
single 110 degree nozzle that puts out

1354
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:05,519
an even rate over the entire uh amount

1355
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,200
of soil that it touches or whether it's

1356
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,039
uh a couple of maybe 80° nozzles that

1357
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:12,358
are designed to overlap each other a

1358
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:14,599
little bit just make sure that in the

1359
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,639
center of that crop row that you're not

1360
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,599
overlapping to the extent that you have

1361
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,679
a double rate

1362
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,838
there okay so here's the list of

1363
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,440
herbicides that are registered in

1364
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,799
brambles and it's actually quite a list

1365
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,240
um it's it's a bigger list in

1366
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,039
strawberries but actually quite a

1367
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,919
smaller list than would be in

1368
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,800
blueberries or even in tree fruits so

1369
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,519
I've broken the list into soil Applied

1370
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,039
Materials and also postemergence

1371
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:44,280
materials so soil Applied Materials um

1372
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,400
on the left here and they've broken up

1373
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,359
also into two categories the first are

1374
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,000
materials that are particularly good on

1375
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,679
Broad leaves but not particularly good

1376
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,199
on grasses and they include ceron

1377
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:59,399
princep simazine and sinbar the

1378
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,318
materials that are very good on annual

1379
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,400
grasses will control some broadleaf

1380
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,558
weeds but are not as good as the three

1381
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,838
materials I just mentioned they include

1382
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,000
solar cam Devol and surf so you

1383
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,078
basically have three materials that are

1384
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,599
great on Broad Leafs three materials

1385
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,920
that are great on grasses and in most

1386
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,838
cases you would use one of each one from

1387
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,838
each

1388
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,159
category combined usually in the spring

1389
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:26,318
and we'll talk about that in a little

1390
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,598
bit and that what gives you sort of

1391
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:32,480
broad spect Wei control a gallery here

1392
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,160
is a a broadleaf material similar to

1393
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,960
princep and simine and sinbar but it's

1394
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,759
only registered on new plantings it's a

1395
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,280
material that is used uh predominantly

1396
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,200
in Nursery production um and uh doesn't

1397
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,200
have a lot of presence in in Fruit crops

1398
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,399
it is not registered for bearing years

1399
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,318
but just for non-bearing years so just

1400
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,800
something to to keep in mind as an

1401
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:57,079
alternative really to either princep or

1402
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,760
simazine or sbar so on the other side

1403
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,318
here we've got post emergence materials

1404
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,119
and they're broken up actually into

1405
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:06,400
three categories here post and fusillade

1406
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:08,760
are are both postemergence grass

1407
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,559
materials they are designed to control

1408
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,079
grasses but only after the grasses are

1409
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,119
up they've got good activity on annual

1410
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,240
grasses but limited activity on

1411
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:22,920
perennial grasses uh touchdown and

1412
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:24,639
Roundup are both postemergence materials

1413
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,920
that are broad spectrum in other words

1414
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,039
they'll control both grasses and Broad

1415
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,318
leaves they will also control annual

1416
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:34,199
weeds as well as perennial weeds so

1417
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:37,039
whether it's a summer annual or a winter

1418
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:39,358
annual or a banial or a perennial

1419
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,279
regardless if it's a creeping perennial

1420
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,358
or a Tap Root perennial whether it's a

1421
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,040
bro leaf or a grass these materials have

1422
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,078
excellent activity touchdown is only

1423
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:50,800
registered in the non-bearing year

1424
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,400
Roundup can be used at any time but also

1425
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,800
remember these materials will have

1426
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:59,160
activity on the crop and so uh small

1427
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,760
canes coming up uh or excessive contact

1428
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:03,920
with the foliage and even contact with

1429
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,800
the base of the canes uh can be a

1430
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,159
problem so my recommendation is that

1431
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,400
touchdown and Roundup really should be

1432
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:14,960
used for control of perennial weeds and

1433
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,838
and probably spot treatment or

1434
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,920
individual hand treatment rather than

1435
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:22,358
any sort of broad spraying on the crop

1436
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,440
the last three materials Groome also

1437
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:29,039
known as paraquat Scythe which is a um

1438
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,440
um material that's made from sheep fat

1439
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,880
actually but it's not Armory approved as

1440
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,960
far as I can tell and also Rage which is

1441
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:40,800
a new material are all um they're all

1442
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,318
burndown materials they have they do not

1443
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,720
translocate um they do not go down to

1444
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:49,119
the root system and kill perennials they

1445
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:51,118
simply burn the tops of the weeds off so

1446
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,240
they have some benefit for example if

1447
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,240
you wanted to burn off uh small winter

1448
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,639
annuals if you wanted to have a clean

1449
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:02,118
cover uh under the crop in the winter

1450
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,798
time uh but they will also burn

1451
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,760
perennial weeds but they'll only burn

1452
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:07,960
the top so in effect they're the same as

1453
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,240
mowing sometimes the use of these

1454
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,318
products is called chemical mowing where

1455
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,598
you can burn off green foliage green

1456
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,838
tissue uh but then especially in the

1457
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:19,359
case of a perennial it'll it'll just

1458
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:21,039
come just come back rage is the newest

1459
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,318
of these materials so I just wanted to

1460
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,239
have a couple of slides to tell you

1461
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,920
about rage common name is carfentrazone

1462
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:30,639
it's it provides post control of broad

1463
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,920
leaves and grasses all of the three

1464
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:36,400
postemergence contact materials that I

1465
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,280
mentioned gramoxone and scythe and rage

1466
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,200
uh will control both grasses and Broad

1467
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,680
Leafs or at least burn all grasses and

1468
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:44,838
Broad leafes above the soil line the

1469
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,118
rate of carfentrazone AR range is 20 to

1470
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:50,119
40 ounces per acre of the formulated

1471
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,480
product usually you'll add either a crop

1472
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:56,079
oil concentrate at 1% which means 1

1473
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,280
gallon per 100 gallons of spray or a

1474
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,839
nonionic surfactant at a quarter of a

1475
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,400
percent by volume which would be one

1476
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,599
quart of surfactant per 100 gallons of

1477
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,599
spray you basically would direct this um

1478
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,039
to the base of the plants before Bud

1479
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,318
break uh they suggest a hooded or

1480
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:16,599
shielded application after Bud break I

1481
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:19,039
frankly am always concerned about any of

1482
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,920
these postemergence materials The Only

1483
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,400
Exception would be the grass materials

1484
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,960
poster fusilade which will not hurt the

1485
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,280
canes um in the case of whether we're

1486
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,720
talking about touchdown or Roundup or

1487
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,200
whether we're talking about any of the

1488
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,439
contact materials I still have a little

1489
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,279
concern about spraying it and contacting

1490
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,519
uh the canes at the bottom especially if

1491
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,240
there's green tissue and again this is a

1492
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:46,159
contact type material which means that

1493
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:49,558
it will burn green foliage um it'll

1494
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:52,480
it'll burn green tissue of any type but

1495
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,880
will not translocate uh the other quick

1496
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,240
thing I guess you should keep in mind

1497
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,599
with any of the postemergence materials

1498
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,519
if with talking about um I see if I can

1499
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,200
go back to the list here yep if we're

1500
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:07,920
talking about post ausel or touchdown or

1501
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,759
Roundup these materials all translocate

1502
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,920
so when you're talking about how much

1503
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,839
water you should use in the application

1504
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,960
the less water the better 10 gallons of

1505
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:20,039
water per acre will give you much

1506
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,960
greater control than 40 gallons of water

1507
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,079
per acre using the same rate of the

1508
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,720
chemical uh in this case we're talking

1509
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,640
about a material that translocates it

1510
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,679
goes in through the fold it translocates

1511
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:31,519
through the entire plant it not only

1512
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:35,358
kills the above ground part of the plant

1513
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:38,440
but kills the root system as well and so

1514
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,798
um more concentrated droplets are the

1515
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,240
key when you're talking about a contact

1516
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:46,759
material gmox scyth or rage the more

1517
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,399
water the better because coverage is

1518
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,520
everything if you contact every leaf

1519
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,039
every leaf will turn brown if you only

1520
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,639
contact leaves at the top of the canopy

1521
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:57,400
only leaves at the top of the canopy

1522
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:00,000
will turn brown you won't get the

1523
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,559
control okay uh one other possible use

1524
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,559
of carfent own or rage is to suppress

1525
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,640
vegetation between rows it actually

1526
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,160
listed on the label so 3 to 4 ounces per

1527
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:12,879
acre of this product combined with crop

1528
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,798
oil concentrate or nonionic surfactant

1529
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,920
uh using a shielded sprayer especially

1530
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,679
if you're doing it after Bud break and

1531
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,720
that cannot be used even though you're

1532
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:24,118
only putting it in the row middles here

1533
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,798
uh cannot be used within 14 days of

1534
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,640
harvest okay so uh again again I

1535
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,039
mentioned some of these already Bramble

1536
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,598
postemergence issues there's always New

1537
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,239
Growth there's no real bark green tissue

1538
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,200
can be hurt and shielding is almost a

1539
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,598
necessity uh so one of the things I

1540
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:41,358
wanted to mention real quick and I hope

1541
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,240
it's on the next slide is what I call a

1542
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,759
spot or cut treatment uh that really

1543
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,039
makes sense when we're talking about

1544
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,680
some of the perennial weeds and again uh

1545
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,838
let me say that the original list of

1546
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,039
materials that I mentioned the soil

1547
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,078
residual materials we're really thinking

1548
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:58,519
about those materials controlling summer

1549
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,160
annual broadleaf weeds and winter annual

1550
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:03,079
broadleaf weeds but not perennials when

1551
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,039
it comes to perennials you need some

1552
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,559
other measure of control and that's

1553
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:10,279
really where the Roundup where the

1554
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:13,359
touchdown uh comes in and

1555
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,119
um so I I get a couple more slides

1556
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,798
before I talk about the spot treatment

1557
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,280
but uh David mentioned some about

1558
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:22,400
pre-plant uh if the field was an annual

1559
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,160
culture then a cover crop followed by

1560
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,920
tillage uh and David mentioned this is

1561
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:28,920
is really preferred if there not a lot

1562
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,838
of perennial weeds out there and David

1563
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,000
talked about cover crops and also about

1564
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,039
fallowing but when he talked about cover

1565
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,880
crops he talked about multiple cover

1566
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:42,119
crops and um that's really the preferred

1567
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,400
method uh even though yes leaving a

1568
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,000
field fow for the whole year and just

1569
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,798
going in with frequent tillage uh does a

1570
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,639
great job of reducing the weed seed

1571
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:54,079
population it's not really the best

1572
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:56,239
thing for the soil so and and this is

1573
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,559
very common in organic production also

1574
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,159
is to use multiple cover crops the idea

1575
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,280
is that if you plant a cover crop in the

1576
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,759
spring and you expect at the end of the

1577
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,160
season to have fewer weed seeds than you

1578
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,240
started at the beginning of the Season

1579
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,199
you absolutely will not have fewer weed

1580
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,399
seeds and I will guarantee you you'll

1581
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:14,118
have more weed seeds the idea with the

1582
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,200
multiple cover crops in the frequent

1583
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:18,920
tillage every time the cover crop gets

1584
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,480
any real good amount of biomass is that

1585
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,960
there's always going to be some weed

1586
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,519
seeds that are going to germinate and

1587
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,760
emerge and grow even with the cover crop

1588
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:29,519
there those weed weeds then produce seed

1589
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,240
you don't want them to produce seed the

1590
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:35,239
idea is to go in and disc or provide

1591
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:38,639
some tillage Rota tilling whatever it is

1592
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:41,078
uh before those new seeds uh new new

1593
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,039
weeds produce seeds and by doing it

1594
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:44,920
multiple times maybe every eight weeks

1595
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,400
or so you still get the benefit of

1596
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,559
having a cover crop there but you're

1597
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,920
also doing a good job of controlling

1598
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,599
those weeds if you have a perennial

1599
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,119
problem out there maybe there was

1600
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:56,119
strawberries there before maybe there

1601
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,160
was blueberries or some other plantings

1602
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:59,920
or maybe you pulled out some apple trees

1603
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,078
you have a pretty good chance of having

1604
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,760
perennial weeds there you might still

1605
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,720
want to use a cover crop early or late

1606
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,760
but you really need to attack that

1607
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,399
perennial weed problem with Roundup in

1608
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,839
the year before you plant uh you do not

1609
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,559
want to put yourself into a situation

1610
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:18,318
where you're waiting till the planting

1611
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:20,400
year or Beyond to start thinking about

1612
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:23,000
controlling peral weeds it really should

1613
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,559
be done the year prior to planting and

1614
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,639
the best time to apply Roundup is in the

1615
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:30,240
late summer or fall and the reason is is

1616
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,838
that you're not just talking about

1617
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,399
burning off what's above ground you want

1618
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:37,639
to control that underground tap rot that

1619
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,639
underground ryome system and the only

1620
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:41,000
way to do that is to apply that material

1621
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:43,400
at a time of the year when you're going

1622
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,480
to get the translocation going down to

1623
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,280
control those weeds and fall is the time

1624
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,760
to do it now if it's a broadleaf species

1625
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,240
like bindweed for example or poison ivy

1626
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,359
or any one of these other Vining

1627
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:58,558
materials or even um dandelion

1628
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:00,719
late summer early fall when they're

1629
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,519
actively growing possibly producing a

1630
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:06,558
reproductive structure like a flower um

1631
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:08,599
you can still get good translocation at

1632
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,880
that time the danger with the broad

1633
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:12,519
leaes is you don't want to wait too late

1634
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,358
because then if you start having cold

1635
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:17,639
weather or Frost you will not get the

1636
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,639
translocation grasses on the other hand

1637
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:22,558
can go later in the season now in the

1638
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:24,078
north uh the the rule of thumb is we

1639
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,960
always tell people if you're going after

1640
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,798
a perennial grass with Roundup it's not

1641
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,760
too late if you haven't sat down for

1642
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:32,880
Thanksgiving dinner yet it's not too

1643
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,920
late to make the application because

1644
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,318
those perennial grasses especially quack

1645
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,480
grass Orchard Grass are still usually

1646
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:41,639
green and actively growing the only

1647
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,358
criteria would be is you'd really like

1648
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:45,960
to wait for them to wait for a day where

1649
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:48,358
maybe is going to get into the high 40s

1650
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,599
or low 50s so maybe you had a frost at

1651
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:51,798
night or a freeze at night but you're

1652
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,318
going to have a fairly warm day uh the

1653
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:56,000
middle of that day would be the best

1654
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:57,719
time to make that application um so we

1655
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,159
really look at sort of a common weed

1656
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:02,358
management strategy using herbicides in

1657
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,440
in brambles we're thinking about using

1658
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:07,838
princep or sinbar for broadleaf weeds as

1659
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,920
a residual material we're looking at

1660
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:14,519
using solar cam or deanol or surfland

1661
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,200
for grass weeds um so annual grasses now

1662
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:20,719
one other thing I'll mention is for new

1663
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:23,078
plantings Devol is probably the safest

1664
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,598
material it can be used on root pieces

1665
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:27,920
it can be used on tissue culture plants

1666
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,160
uh so if something for the first year

1667
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,000
Devol may be the better of the grass

1668
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,558
choices in the case of the broadleaf

1669
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,760
materials sinbar really is not a good

1670
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:40,039
option during the transplant year and if

1671
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,960
you use any PRP it really should be at a

1672
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:44,680
half rate and I'm not really crazy about

1673
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:47,599
using PRP the first year until maybe the

1674
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:49,719
first fall um of making maybe a half

1675
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,599
rate application the first year and that

1676
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:54,118
is in our recommendations that are are

1677
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,680
listed as uh that you can find online uh

1678
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:58,079
with the UMass website in the New

1679
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,558
England small fruit uh pest Pest

1680
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,599
Management guide ceron I didn't say a

1681
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,920
whole lot about ceron is not really a

1682
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:10,599
replacement for princep or sinbar what

1683
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:13,000
ceron is is a soil applied material that

1684
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,240
can do a good job of controlling a wide

1685
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,079
range of perennial species and the

1686
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,919
reason I I want to spend just a minute

1687
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:22,079
or so on ceron is because unlike these

1688
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,960
other crops that have a lot of bark

1689
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,839
where you can use Roundup in the fall

1690
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,880
and you have bark there and the crop is

1691
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:31,000
protect protected you need to be really

1692
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,798
careful in raspberries because just like

1693
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,199
uh the weeds will have a better chance

1694
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:38,880
of dying in the fall um if you get

1695
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:40,960
Roundup on your raspberry crop there is

1696
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,880
also a lot of translocation going on at

1697
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,559
that time of the year for the crop so

1698
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,400
the time that you can you could provide

1699
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,519
the biggest danger to your raspberry

1700
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,280
crop or your Bramble crop in general is

1701
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:52,559
going to be with a fall application of

1702
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,240
Roundup so if you just have a few

1703
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,720
perennial weeds here and there spot

1704
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,000
treatments make a lot of sense but if

1705
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:59,279
you've got a lot of perennial weeds

1706
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,400
maybe you've already got the crop

1707
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,839
planted you forgot about perennial weeds

1708
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,200
during the fallow year or time has gone

1709
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,480
by and you've got a lot of perineal

1710
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,239
weeds present you maybe you should think

1711
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,079
about using casson ceron comes as a

1712
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,919
wettable powder it also comes as a

1713
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,798
granular formulation if you're going

1714
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,960
after perennial weeds the granular

1715
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:20,079
formulation makes the most sense the

1716
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,280
wettable powder material does not work

1717
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,160
as well as the granules the key about

1718
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,960
casserine application is the probably

1719
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:30,879
the best time would be very late fall

1720
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,318
early winter before the ground freezes

1721
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,480
and just before the first snowfall you

1722
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:37,838
want to get this material on when the

1723
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:42,199
ground when it's weather is cold above

1724
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:45,000
50° is not good it will volatilize so um

1725
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:46,480
even this time of year um if we have a

1726
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,960
little break in the weather you can get

1727
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,880
out there maybe there's no snow but

1728
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,039
there's a snowstorm coming it still

1729
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,720
makes sense to put some cter on some

1730
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:56,400
people wait a little bit later but when

1731
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,439
we start getting into a situ sitation

1732
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,599
where you might have temperatures 50° or

1733
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,960
higher it's probably too late to apply

1734
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,000
the casson and again we talked about

1735
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,440
some of these postemergence materials

1736
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,798
Roundup gmox or rage for post Emer

1737
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,599
control again uh gramoxone and rage are

1738
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,920
only uh contact materials round up once

1739
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,200
we get into the establishment year

1740
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,280
because touchdown can no longer be used

1741
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,919
uh is used for perennials um now the the

1742
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,200
spot treatment I mentioned before is

1743
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,079
something you won't find in the

1744
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:27,078
recommendations but I wanted to mention

1745
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,400
it real quick

1746
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:30,760
there was a time when you could buy a

1747
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,280
little Clipper uh one of them was called

1748
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,599
clip clean both with a K Kip

1749
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,400
Kleen and if you Google that you might

1750
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,960
find some other products that are out

1751
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,880
there and what these are um are ways to

1752
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,000
apply a small amount of Roundup onto the

1753
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,720
blade of your Clipper but it can also be

1754
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,318
done by hand so we're talking about

1755
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:51,959
using a handheld Clipper uh you cannot

1756
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:54,000
use straight Roundup because it's too

1757
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,119
thick you need two parts water one part

1758
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,719
Roundup you basically would dip the

1759
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,160
blade of your hand Clippers into the

1760
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:04,038
solution and make a cut near the base of

1761
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:05,480
the perennial weed now what makes this

1762
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,079
the good part about this let me tell you

1763
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,760
about the bad part first the bad part is

1764
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,839
it's obviously very labor intensive

1765
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,039
because you're going to go out there and

1766
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:14,960
you're going to cut every one of these

1767
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:16,520
weeds the good part is is it doesn't

1768
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,039
make any difference what time of year

1769
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:22,239
you do it unlike a a foler application

1770
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,559
of Roundup which is really only going to

1771
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,798
work late summer or fall to get the

1772
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,119
translocation and application with a

1773
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,119
Clipper in this manner will work at any

1774
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,240
time of the year so if you have a Vining

1775
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,119
perennial for example that's growing up

1776
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:36,798
into your planting you can go out there

1777
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,280
in the spring when it's 3 or 4 inches

1778
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:40,199
high before it ever grows into the

1779
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,599
planting and you can make some cuts and

1780
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:44,199
maybe you take a row this week or this

1781
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,599
month and another row next month but

1782
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:47,639
over the course of the growing season

1783
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,640
you can go after it just about any time

1784
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,038
that the weeds are growing so it has

1785
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:54,239
potential for spot treatment of perineal

1786
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:57,278
weeds without making an application with

1787
01:01:54,239 --> 01:02:00,000
a sprayer without um potentially

1788
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:01,719
contacting the crop and causing problems

1789
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,880
but something that is highly effective

1790
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:07,118
so just something to consider so again

1791
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:10,240
here's the list as as we mentioned um

1792
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:14,480
and again soil applied post emergence uh

1793
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:17,000
grass materials bride Leaf materials and

1794
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,240
um hopefully after I went through the

1795
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,079
explanation that entire list makes a

1796
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:24,000
little bit more sense about how things

1797
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:26,880
uh uh fit in so some final thoughts know

1798
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,679
you weed problems uh mulch effectively

1799
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,640
when you can do it maintain the middles

1800
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:32,639
as David has mentioned uh if you're

1801
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,358
using herbicides apply them at the right

1802
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,159
time at the right rates and with the

1803
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:39,000
right equipment to avoid crop injury and

1804
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:41,480
to maximize control I I believe that

1805
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,639
using residual materials makes more

1806
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,119
sense than postemergence materials in

1807
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:47,879
brambles for the most part uh rotate

1808
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:50,079
chemistries means that if you use one

1809
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,920
product this year for broadleaf material

1810
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,839
control use a different product next

1811
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,880
year if you're using a grass material

1812
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,880
and you use surf land this year use de

1813
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,880
all next year try not to use the same

1814
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,838
materials over and over again and please

1815
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,559
uh read and follow all label directions

1816
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:06,880
don't forget about the work protection

1817
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,440
standards they apply to All Growers they

1818
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,599
apply to Conventional materials they

1819
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,358
apply to organic materials read and

1820
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:14,920
follow all the label directions follow

1821
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:16,960
the work protection standards and keep

1822
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,440
yourself your family and your employees

1823
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,920
safe all I excellent job of giving us an

1824
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,880
overview of each um cultural and

1825
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,159
chemical we control op options I think

1826
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,920
it's probably one of the best

1827
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:30,960
comprehensive presentations on weat

1828
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,079
control for Bramble crops that I've ever

1829
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,079
been at um I also want to just say one

1830
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,880
thing and maybe um Rich you could answer

1831
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,480
this I do not have Gallery touchdown or

1832
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,200
rage in our

1833
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,119
2010 guidelines and I just attempted to

1834
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,118
try to check that you don't happen to

1835
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,599
know whether those are registered in New

1836
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:53,440
York do

1837
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,798
you I believe touchdown is touchdown is

1838
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,679
actually uh the hopefully the lawyers

1839
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:01,519
want hear this is exactly the same thing

1840
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:05,838
as Roundup different company um but it

1841
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:10,559
only it only has a a um non-bearing

1842
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:11,920
label um and uh but it it it's exactly

1843
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,079
the same product you could certainly use

1844
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,079
Roundup in the in the transplant year if

1845
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,798
you don't have um um if you don't have

1846
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:22,240
uh touchdown registered uh rage's brand

1847
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:25,119
new it is possible that your DEQ has not

1848
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,358
approved it yet in uh in New York state

1849
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,519
it's I believe believe this is the first

1850
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:31,199
year we just put it into our our new

1851
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:33,519
guide which will be coming out in 2010

1852
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,118
um and gallery has been around for a

1853
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,519
while as I mentioned it's a nursery

1854
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,920
material but it is possible that New

1855
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,440
York has never registered one of the

1856
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,559
reasons some people might not have put

1857
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,720
it in all their recommendations is it's

1858
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,760
quite expensive and and for for that

1859
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:48,358
reason alone it might not be in your

1860
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,920
guide but it is worth checking for New

1861
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:53,480
York State okay I will do that so for

1862
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,798
those of you who are from New York State

1863
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,798
we'll try to make uh if if any of these

1864
01:04:55,798 --> 01:04:59,239
are um actually legal and able to be

1865
01:04:57,798 --> 01:05:01,639
used we'll try to put that on the

1866
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:03,558
Cornell Berry website and I certainly

1867
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:06,278
thank Dr Bano for letting us know about

1868
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:08,039
them so I'm hoping that we have some

1869
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:10,119
folks who have questions we're going to

1870
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:13,079
move into the Final Phase but now's your

1871
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:16,559
chance to ask um anything that's on your

1872
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:19,680
mind or um that you might want to know

1873
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,480
about we control for Bramble crops very

1874
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,038
quiet group I'm hoping that you can

1875
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,119
actually hear us I'm sure you would let

1876
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:30,278
us know if you couldn't

1877
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:33,318
and um I just put the last

1878
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:37,039
uh the um page up here that has the

1879
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:39,000
handouts and other information about uh

1880
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,119
weat control for Bramble crops that you

1881
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
can

1882
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:45,559
download um I have one more poll well oh

1883
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,358
we've got a few people typing some

1884
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:50,319
things that's great so let's see what

1885
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:53,038
they say I'll open up this other poll

1886
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:56,679
just to get some ideas about whether or

1887
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:58,640
not people had some um um challenges

1888
01:05:56,679 --> 01:06:01,199
with the webinar this

1889
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:01,920
time uh Jeff asked about any experience

1890
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:04,480
with

1891
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,358
wipers uh so let me let me address let

1892
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,599
me address that so a wiper application

1893
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:13,119
uh is similar it's sort of a cross

1894
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:15,760
between uh making a spray uh or using

1895
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,119
the Clippers in terms of Effectiveness

1896
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,760
it will work the same as a spray will

1897
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:22,720
work uh it it does not have the benefit

1898
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,200
of the clipping which will uh give you

1899
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:27,038
the quick translocation but certainly

1900
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,639
any of these wipers they make these

1901
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,119
little little ones that are like hockey

1902
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,639
sticks with the nylon rope uh just

1903
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,559
remember just as I mentioned before

1904
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:38,000
about the Clippers uh you cannot use

1905
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,400
straight Roundup in there um and um you

1906
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,039
have to use some water because um the

1907
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,079
Roundup is too thick uh it will not flow

1908
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,079
through that nylon rope but it will give

1909
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:49,760
you the same effect as if you are making

1910
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:51,798
a a foler application and again because

1911
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,880
it's similar to a foler application fall

1912
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:57,880
is the best time uh there are uh many

1913
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,599
generic glyphosate labels out there as

1914
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:03,240
Eric has mentioned I have not seen the

1915
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,519
labels of all of the generic glyphosate

1916
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:08,038
products because of course Roundup is is

1917
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:10,838
about is more than 15 or 17 years old

1918
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:12,559
now so it is off patent um I believe

1919
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:14,159
that many of the companies especially

1920
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,400
when they're gearing towards vegetable

1921
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,639
and fruit Growers have tried to uh make

1922
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,440
the labels very similar uh but of course

1923
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,960
if you buy any of the generic glyphosate

1924
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:26,720
products make sure that these crops are

1925
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,720
actually listed on those uh those labels

1926
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,480
all right we've got one other person

1927
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,759
typing I'm not sure if he's typing to

1928
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,559
the group I did want to let you know if

1929
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,039
you do type your question into the whole

1930
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:42,440
group it will be recorded for um during

1931
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:44,000
the archive recording so everyone will

1932
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,079
be able to see it later and that's

1933
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,599
helpful and uh most a lot of people have

1934
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:53,640
voted but um I I do want to thank both

1935
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:55,079
of our speakers um we'll give a few more

1936
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:57,719
seconds and see if this question is

1937
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:59,720
coming thank a few our speakers for

1938
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,000
joining us today I also want to thank

1939
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:03,879
all of you

1940
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,480
attendees uh we had some challenges at

1941
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,760
least on my end we had some video and

1942
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,599
audio challenges um but it doesn't look

1943
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,240
like it was too bad for folks um but I

1944
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,798
appreciate you hanging in there with us

1945
