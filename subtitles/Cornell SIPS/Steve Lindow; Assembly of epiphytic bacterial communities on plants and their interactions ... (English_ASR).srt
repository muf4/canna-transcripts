1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,080
well thanks dollar welcome all from

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
smoky california

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
it's uh another beautiful sunny but

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,160
smoky day and uh

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
really unfortunately we can't meet in

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,399
person i was kind of hoping to see some

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
nice

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,320
colorful east coast scenes here in the

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,038
fall but we're going to be doing this

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
all at home at

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,760
our our new world so

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,518
today i'm going to talk about uh

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
basically the plant microbiome and you

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,799
know the microbiome science is really

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
hot these days

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,399
but not that many people look at the

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
bacteria and other microbes on the

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
surface of plants and that's really what

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,558
i want to try to get you excited about

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,559
today

23
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,320
i'm going to talk about epiphytes

24
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,320
microbes that live on the surface of

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
plants and

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,119
really i think they've got a lot of

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,359
interesting features they're certainly

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,959
very pertinent to plant pathology but

29
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,839
we're going to be talking about their

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
context in a number of different

31
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,320
settings

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
now i'm going to study mostly epiphytic

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,478
bacteria we're going to be talking about

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,118
those that live on the surface of

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,319
healthy plants for the most part

36
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,599
so this is images a typical image of a

37
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,279
leaf surface this

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,959
tunnel-like object you're looking down

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
as a stomata

40
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,719
they're very small obviously on the

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,719
surface are these large

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,478
numbers of small blobs these are the

43
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,400
bacterial cells

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,879
this is very typical of all healthy

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,680
plants they're somewhere between

46
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,438
10 000 and about 10 million of these

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,360
kind of bacteria found per square

48
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,359
centimeter of leaf

49
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,239
so basically edible plants non-edible

50
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,560
plants they're all going to have very

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,078
similar densities

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
plants are very abundant on the plant

53
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,839
obviously on the planet obviously so

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599
there's about avogadro's number of

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
bacteria when you consider all of the

56
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,078
plants uh and all of the bacteria that

57
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,438
would be considered on them

58
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,359
this is probably an underestimate

59
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,398
because it really been very little look

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,478
of

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,599
microbes that are on plants in tropical

62
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,799
areas and it's

63
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,798
very likely that microbes on tropical

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
plants that are wet all the time

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,439
are likely to be even higher than what

66
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,199
we're going to talk about today

67
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,000
now much of the study of epiphytes has

68
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,639
been driven by uh plant disease

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,479
it's been known for a while that uh

70
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,919
pathogens especially plant pathogenic

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
bacteria

72
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,079
exist as epiphytes on healthy plants

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,400
before inciting disease

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,879
and in fact we can often predict disease

75
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,159
based on the population size of these

76
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,399
bacteria that

77
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,280
are essentially inoculant can eventually

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
enter and cause

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,640
disease and a couple of examples of

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
those are

81
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,639
bacterial brown spot of being in the

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
upper right and fire blight on the lower

83
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,919
right

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,439
these are both classic examples of how

85
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,238
pest management is

86
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,280
is uh attuned to the population of these

87
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
microbes

88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
on the leaf because low populations of

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,039
microbes on the plant there's very

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
little likelihood

91
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,239
that even if environmental conditions

92
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
became favorable

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
that disease would ever occur but

94
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,238
everything else being equal higher

95
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
populations will increase the likelihood

96
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,800
of disease

97
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
so again this has been driven uh a lot

98
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
by plant pathology

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,439
and the system is very very much like uh

100
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,878
human skin we all have staph aureus on

101
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,598
our under

102
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,679
on our skin and disease is really

103
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,919
unlikely unless we do have an oculum

104
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
present

105
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,079
now other groups of microbes that get a

106
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
little less attention that

107
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
i think are quite interesting and very

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,840
important is

109
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
uh bacteria that can't catalyze ice

110
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,878
formation

111
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,120
this work that i worked on long ago

112
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,719
bacteria that catalyze ice are very

113
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
prominent on plants in fact that's

114
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,479
basically the only place you would find

115
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
these microbes

116
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,840
and these are quite unique in that they

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
have the ability to catalyze ice and

118
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,959
water that would otherwise super cool

119
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,759
you see in the graph on the right hand

120
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,719
side

121
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,039
the ability of water to super cool water

122
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,359
does not freeze at zero degrees

123
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,280
celsius to form ice in fact it will

124
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,360
supercool to temperatures

125
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,680
easily and even as cold as around -40

126
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
but these bacteria can catalyze ice at a

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,360
temperature of about

128
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:18,159
minus one or minus and because of that

129
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
water cannot remain liquid to those cold

130
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
temperatures whether that otherwise

131
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,000
would

132
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,918
these are very important to plant

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
because plants are mostly water

134
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,959
and the bacteria that live on the plants

135
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
then

136
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,560
limit the ability of that water within

137
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,520
the plants to super cool and when ice

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
forms

139
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,680
we get a mechanical damage to the plant

140
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
that we call frost damage

141
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,519
and again it's because of the bacteria

142
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,159
that plants do in fact freeze because

143
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,079
without the bacteria present plants

144
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,080
themselves can easily reciprocal to

145
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,279
around minus six minus

146
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,959
seven degrees celsius uh the water in

147
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,638
those plants will remain liquid super

148
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,519
cool but in the presence of the bacteria

149
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,000
they will in fact

150
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,399
nucleate and freeze at a temperature of

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,918
around minus one to minus two

152
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,399
and that's typically where we start to

153
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,319
see frost damage in plants is around 28

154
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,679
29 degrees fahrenheit

155
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,839
minus two celsius and again it's the

156
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
population size of these bacteria that

157
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,198
drive

158
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,679
the uh the freezing temperature of the

159
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
plants

160
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,038
we have very high population sizes of

161
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
bacteria

162
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,439
the plants will not supercool more than

163
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,839
two around minus two

164
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
but as we decrease the population sizes

165
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,839
of the bacteria on the plant

166
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
the plant has the ability to super cool

167
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,319
and approaches

168
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,038
a temperature of around minus five or

169
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,879
minus six

170
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,079
when they're going to start to freeze

171
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,319
because of other

172
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,240
substances within the plant that cause

173
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,680
nucleation

174
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
so if you actually get up and wash

175
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
plants freeze you'll see images like you

176
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,360
see in the upper left where

177
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,198
these are citrus leaves i took picture

178
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,400
in the morning around

179
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,080
minus four degrees celsius out you see

180
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,198
dew drops on the leaves that are still

181
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,038
liquid

182
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,478
but in this darkened area ice has

183
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,159
started to form and you can actually see

184
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,199
the dew drops are starting to

185
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,880
look icy presumably because a particular

186
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
bacterium at that site

187
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,279
catalyzed isolation and that ice is now

188
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,239
going to start spreading and within a

189
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,000
few minutes

190
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,038
this cluster of leaves would have been

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,800
frozen so again bacteria limit the super

192
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,478
cooling ability of plants

193
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,240
and thereby cause frost damage and

194
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,159
that's also one of the justifications

195
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,319
for a lot of the work that we're going

196
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,439
to talk about today is can we modify the

197
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
communities

198
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,079
after knowing enough how they form to

199
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,198
reduce the population sizes of either

200
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,359
pathogens

201
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,360
or in this case ice nucleating bacteria

202
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
now these bacteria not only are they

203
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
interesting and important on plants but

204
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,038
they're also

205
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,919
actually quite important in a whole

206
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,000
global precipitation cycle

207
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,839
it turns out for various reasons the

208
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
bacteria that catalyze ice are most

209
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,279
common on the leaf surfaces

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,598
a little later on i'm going to talk

211
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,799
about the escape of bacteria from leaves

212
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,879
to go up into the air very abundant

213
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
about a million or so per square meter

214
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,639
per hour

215
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,639
leave leaf surfaces fly up in the air

216
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
if you had clouds above you you would

217
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,598
see that most of the water in those

218
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,160
clouds are super cool

219
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,199
water droplets they're very cold fog if

220
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
you would

221
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,879
and these super cold water droplets are

222
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
small they don't

223
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
fall out of the cloud because they're

224
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
too small but if ice starts to form in

225
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,038
this case by a bacterial cell

226
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,720
interacting with these drops of water

227
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,478
the drops of water will start to

228
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
coalesce and form larger and larger

229
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,240
particles of ice

230
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,000
and eventually those ice crystals get

231
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,519
big enough that they're too large to be

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,038
supported in the cloud and they start

233
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,680
falling out

234
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,199
they always start falling as ice and if

235
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
it's warm on the way down it melts and

236
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
we call it rain

237
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,120
it's cold all the way down we call it

238
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,399
snow but much of the precipitation

239
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
in the temperate part of the world

240
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,439
except for very close to the equator

241
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,879
is driven by this ice forming process in

242
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,800
the clouds and

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,199
because the bacteria are again

244
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
emigrating from plants into the air

245
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,439
they are now thought to be some of the

246
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
major participants in this process

247
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,519
certain minerals and other things can

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
also do it but these bacteria

249
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,560
because they're so efficient at

250
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,799
catalyzing ice

251
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,360
at a warm temperature are thought to be

252
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
particularly important

253
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
and for those of you who are skiers or

254
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
boarders uh

255
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
these ice nucleating bacteria including

256
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,400
pseudomonas serenity the most common and

257
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,120
important ice nucleator

258
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,638
are used to make artificial snow they

259
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
grow up sit them on a certainty freeze

260
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,439
dry and add it to the water that's

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
blowing up in the air

262
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,799
so that you get ice forming in the air

263
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,958
rather than

264
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,598
freezing rain if you would so it's

265
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,679
become a huge industrial process

266
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,759
some million pounds or so a year of

267
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,719
freeze-dried bacteria are made

268
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,559
for artificial snow i wish i could say i

269
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,320
made a penny out of it but

270
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,759
hopefully pseudomonas reindeer making

271
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
the world a little better

272
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,000
in that context so again what are the

273
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,240
bacteria doing we saw

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,320
nucleaters and pathogens but most

275
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,680
bacteria aren't either

276
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,959
but moldy bacteria that live on plants

277
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,559
are thought to be important in

278
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,838
protecting plants against other

279
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,799
pathogens

280
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,279
this is quite indisputable and a classic

281
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,399
example of that phenomenon would be

282
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,480
fire blight of pears and apples and the

283
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,440
presence of other bacteria that do not

284
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
cause disease

285
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
being able to protect against pathogens

286
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
that do

287
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,799
in this typical scenario the flowers of

288
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,480
an apple in this case

289
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,919
are emerging most plants as they emerge

290
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
into the world are almost sterile

291
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,278
without any bacteria in this case

292
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,838
they stigma of the surface of the pistol

293
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,480
is

294
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,320
certainly free of pathogen if you become

295
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,959
inoculated with a pathogen shown that

296
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
little

297
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,639
red cells here they can grow rapidly on

298
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
a somatic stigmatic surface

299
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,159
get the high populations that can

300
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,200
eventually invade the flower

301
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,039
and eventually cause disease but we know

302
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
though that if we were to inoculate that

303
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,480
stigma soon after it emerged with a

304
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,958
non-pathogen

305
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
it will grow to high numbers as well and

306
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,599
then if the

307
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,000
immigration of the pathogen were to

308
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,278
occur there's limited opportunity for it

309
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,078
to grow because of

310
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,320
either competition or anabiosis and as

311
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,199
population size remains sufficiently low

312
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
that disease

313
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
is unlikely and this is one of the

314
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
the classic examples of biological

315
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,759
control where

316
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
here you see one of the strains we found

317
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,480
pseudomonas fluorescens a506

318
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,440
being applied to the flowers of these

319
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
trees

320
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,240
early in the spring so that the process

321
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,600
of colonization if you would is

322
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,278
accelerated to offer some protection

323
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,879
against the pathogen

324
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,480
and there are other bacteria and yeast

325
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,759
that are now being used

326
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,000
for a similar mode so let's talk a

327
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,399
little

328
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
bit about how and why do bacteria grow

329
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,120
on plants

330
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
and part of it is simply diet they have

331
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,639
to have carbon to grow

332
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
and it seems like the abundance of

333
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,159
various carbon containing compounds is

334
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,000
the limiting factor for the growth of

335
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,000
these microbes

336
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
we found some years ago that in fact the

337
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
bacterial numbers are limited by the

338
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
amount of sugar and that plants vary a

339
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,640
lot

340
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,000
in the amount of these nutrients that

341
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,000
are found on the plant

342
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,360
sounds like cucumbers and tomatoes and

343
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
beans are much higher than peas and corn

344
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,320
when you look at either the number of

345
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,759
amount of sugar that's found on a plant

346
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,240
and the bacterial numbers that can

347
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,000
result and i talk a lot about sugar

348
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,879
because sugar does seem to be the

349
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,519
primary carbon source on most plants

350
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,679
if you look at bean leaves as an example

351
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,440
sucrose glucose and fructose are by far

352
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,639
the most abundant carbon containing

353
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,560
compounds

354
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,958
you have some organic acids and

355
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,000
amino acids and all but together there

356
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,239
is not a lot

357
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,679
there's only a few micrograms per leaf

358
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,759
of these carbon

359
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,078
but if you add it up that's about enough

360
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,000
to generate about 100 million bacteria

361
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,799
on a leaf and that's about the

362
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,720
population size that we typically see

363
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,759
so it seems to be a carbon but not a

364
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,278
nitrogen limited situation

365
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,879
but more importantly and what's going to

366
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,879
be central to what we're going to talk

367
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,639
about today is the fact that this carbon

368
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,759
does not seem to be distributed

369
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,799
uniformly around the leaf

370
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,439
now using a sugar biosensor in this case

371
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,319
for the

372
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,079
sugar fructose a fructose responsive

373
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,160
promoter linked to an unstable

374
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,359
gfp we could examine the ability of

375
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,719
bacteria to

376
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,800
be consuming sugar so if we put

377
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
a biosensor that we had grown up in the

378
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,399
lab

379
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,720
containing that gene fusion growing

380
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,958
without any fructose onto a leaf

381
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
come back two hours after inoculation

382
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,838
you can see that

383
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
initially they were non-fluorescent but

384
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,440
within two hours

385
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,839
many if not most of the cells we applied

386
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,240
to the leaf have become green

387
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,320
fluorescent

388
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
but if you come back and look 24 hours

389
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,920
after we had inoculated

390
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,360
and i you just have to believe me that

391
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,120
in fact there's still cells all over

392
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,560
this leaf there's only cells in a few

393
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
local areas

394
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,000
where in fact the cells remain green

395
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
it's an unstable

396
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
gfp has to continue to be made to be

397
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,078
remained fluorescent

398
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
and it appears then that there is at

399
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,679
least a little bit of sugar all over the

400
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,039
leaf surface but

401
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,479
abundant sugar or replenishing sugar is

402
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,360
really only present

403
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,399
in a few locations so we kind of use

404
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
this as an

405
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
image of a nutritional desert if you

406
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
would there's

407
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,959
a little resource everywhere but only a

408
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,480
few oasis if you would

409
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:39,039
where the sugars become quite abundant

410
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,199
this helps explain what you see when you

411
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,439
take lots of images of a leaf surface

412
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,399
and one of my former students did a lot

413
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,279
of studies of basically

414
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,120
microbes on the leaf and what you'll see

415
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,879
on this image and here's some stomata

416
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,399
for studies comparison and

417
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,000
many parts of the leaf are rather

418
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,759
impoverished there's little or no

419
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,919
bacteria present

420
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,319
but you'll see occasionally these large

421
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,639
aggregates of bacteria

422
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
some call them biofilm but they're large

423
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,079
piles of bacteria wood in this image

424
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,759
there's probably

425
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,919
10 000 bacteria in this particular image

426
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,159
they're not very numerous but they are

427
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,198
very very large numbers of microbes that

428
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,159
occur in these particular sites just to

429
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,120
some

430
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,000
numbers to that look at the red bars

431
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,000
here

432
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
this is the number of cells in a local

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,399
area we're going to call an aggregate

434
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,800
from single cells

435
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,159
up to thousands of cells in aggregate

436
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,599
and how many there were

437
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,278
on a log scale you'll see that there's

438
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,360
thousands of sites where there's only

439
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,519
one or a few cells in a given location

440
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,159
and only a few places where these

441
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,759
large aggregates occur but if you look

442
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,480
at the red balls on the lower

443
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,919
graph where you look at the cumulative

444
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
proportion of the

445
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,278
population that occurred as a function

446
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,679
of the

447
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,919
sign of aggregate in which they occurred

448
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,479
and let's just use 100 cells as

449
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,479
a cut off you'll see that more than half

450
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,959
of all the microbes in a cell

451
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,720
on a leaf were in fact in these large

452
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,239
aggregates larger than about 100

453
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,759
cells and so in many ways it brings me

454
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
very much like

455
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,600
distribution of humans on the on the

456
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,680
planet the united states

457
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
little circles here represent the size

458
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,078
of cities

459
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
from over here where i live in

460
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,679
california you fly

461
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
toward new york you're going to pass

462
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,120
over chicago after flying over the

463
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
flyover states

464
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,039
and you look down you're going to see

465
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
lots and lots of farms as you go across

466
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,559
certainly in the midwest

467
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,920
but not until you see a city are you

468
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,359
going to really see large numbers of

469
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,198
people

470
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
and it always reminded me of california

471
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,599
which is a huge

472
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,198
city huge state lots of forests and

473
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,759
deserts and all but it's also the most

474
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,319
urbanized state in the united states

475
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,360
97 of californians live in cities

476
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,120
greater than 100

477
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,079
000 people including myself so again

478
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,440
most people in the world tend to live in

479
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,278
cities now and

480
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
life in the city is very very different

481
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,519
than where i grew up

482
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,559
in a country up in oregon and we're

483
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,440
going to talk now about

484
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,958
the differences of being part of these

485
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
groups

486
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,039
life in the city versus life in the

487
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,679
country and the first thing you

488
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,439
can recognize is the fact that looking

489
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,958
at the cells whether they're alive or

490
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,600
dead

491
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,559
uh after exposure to a typical daylight

492
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
condition so

493
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,159
wet night today is sunny and dry in the

494
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,359
daytime

495
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,759
and look at the the yellow line

496
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,240
again and this is going to be the the

497
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,720
proportion of the population that is in

498
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
uh

499
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,519
that are living and you can see that all

500
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,599
of these more solitary cells for the

501
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,039
most part are dead and it's really only

502
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
in these cells that are

503
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,480
in these large aggregates larger than

504
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,838
about 100 cells

505
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,399
and in fact those cells are live

506
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,880
so life is tough in the country if you

507
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,519
would if you're in a micro

508
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,799
and it's not only important for you to

509
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,440
probably grow up

510
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,000
amongst other cells on a leaf surface

511
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
probably

512
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,400
driven by this local availability of

513
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,720
sugar that's coming from the leafs

514
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,959
but in fact immigration successful

515
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,038
immigration to the leaf is also

516
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,038
very much favored by the presence of

517
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,838
these aggregates

518
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,720
this is important in issues such as food

519
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,599
safety

520
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,038
we've done a bit of work on salmonella

521
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,399
human pathogen

522
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,400
something you don't want to see on

523
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,440
plants that you're eating but is often

524
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,919
there

525
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,720
it turns out that the salmonella itself

526
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,080
is a very poor colonist of plants

527
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,319
when it is put on by itself it

528
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,558
quite quickly dies but if we were to

529
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,119
immigrate salmonella onto cells

530
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,160
hunt leaves and look to see whether it

531
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,839
landed in a

532
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,759
in a barren part of the leaf where there

533
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,839
were not other bacteria

534
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,119
or whether it had landed amongst these

535
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,798
aggregates that we had already

536
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,399
established on the leaf

537
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,839
you'll see that it was really only those

538
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
cells that landed amongst other

539
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,279
organisms

540
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,319
that were alive most of these solitary

541
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,519
cells were in fact

542
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,359
dead so i think this is

543
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,279
image is really what you should think

544
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,918
about when you think of life on a leaf

545
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,000
that

546
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,080
much of the leaf is relatively poorly

547
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
colonized probably because

548
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,839
for unknown reasons there isn't very

549
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,519
much nutrient there

550
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,279
but where nutrients are available the

551
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,200
microbes can make relatively

552
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,359
large aggregations or

553
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
biofilms if you would here you can see

554
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,839
the individual cells and they're kind of

555
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,918
in this

556
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,839
cocoon if you would of extracellular

557
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
polysaccharide

558
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,000
if it was at all humid it is probably

559
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,038
holding on to water it's probably a

560
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,519
a slime pile if you would and again

561
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,759
life within that slime pile is probably

562
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,000
very different from life out here where

563
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,519
any individual cell is very unlikely to

564
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,759
have made enough of a

565
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,359
modification of its environment in a

566
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,079
biofilm if you would

567
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,959
to benefit from it whereas being part of

568
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,199
a group

569
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,600
there would be this cooperation and

570
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,960
benefit from having others also

571
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,639
modifying that environment but looking

572
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,240
at that image immediately

573
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,360
made me think of quorum simpson growing

574
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,000
uh paradigm in microbiology where

575
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,678
we used to think of uh microbial cells

576
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
especially bacteria which are single

577
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,038
cells

578
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,640
and being rather individualistic in

579
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,960
their behavior

580
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
but it turns out that microbes do have

581
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,759
very different behaviors when they're

582
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,960
part of a group than when they're

583
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,798
solitary and this process is uh known as

584
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,679
quorum sensing

585
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,519
where the mechanism then driving it is

586
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,600
where individual bacteria are all

587
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,558
bacteria individually produce small

588
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,038
numbers of

589
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,480
small molecules which are released from

590
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,038
the cell

591
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
if the cells are relatively solitary

592
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,839
those

593
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,679
signal molecules basically diffuse away

594
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,599
and the cells know that they're alone

595
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
because they can't perceive their signal

596
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,359
molecule

597
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,279
but if the cells end up having neighbors

598
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,879
especially neighbors of their own type

599
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,839
which are all making the same signal

600
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,000
molecule the local concentration of the

601
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,079
signal molecule is going to increase

602
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,599
and they they can then re-perceive that

603
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,678
signal molecule

604
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,279
by a variety of mechanisms and use that

605
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
then as a signal

606
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,960
to change the transcription of genes

607
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,599
which are

608
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,279
important to be regulated differently

609
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,079
when they are part of a group

610
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,000
than when they are solitary and in the

611
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,519
case of cinema serenity our

612
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,440
favorite microbe one of the traits that

613
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,279
we know to be regulated in this way

614
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,279
is motility it turns out that when the

615
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,879
cells have the ability to sense a signal

616
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,918
molecule and when they're in part of a

617
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
group

618
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,960
they are not modal but mutants which are

619
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,440
blocked in the ability to produce a

620
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,558
signal molecule as you see on this

621
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,558
right hand uh image the cells have this

622
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,038
in this case swarming ability able to

623
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,720
move around actively

624
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,319
and in that case it turns out that the

625
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,159
ability to signal

626
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,678
and tell themselves that they're part of

627
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,400
a group actually

628
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,360
reduces the virulence of

629
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,159
cinematoserenity because

630
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,279
the wild-type strain makes less disease

631
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,440
than a mutant

632
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,279
presumably because it's not able to move

633
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
around on the leaf surface

634
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,960
find its way to these sites where

635
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,719
nutrients would be available and

636
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,840
probably also

637
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,360
enter into the plant active motility

638
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,839
does seem to be something you'd want to

639
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,399
do in that kind of a scenario where out

640
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,798
on a

641
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,240
nutritional desert and need to find the

642
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,240
right places if you would to live

643
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,919
but it also calls into question how

644
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,199
much fidelity there is to this system

645
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,120
and that

646
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,558
microbes that don't live in the world in

647
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,079
pure cultures in the

648
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,319
case of the leaf surface certainly

649
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,158
there's usually a quite a variety of

650
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,639
microbes that live on leaf

651
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,120
the upper picture here shows a typical

652
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,840
leaf washing plated out and you'll see

653
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,439
a variety of microbes epiphytes tend to

654
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,480
be very colorful

655
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,080
they're often red or pink or yellow part

656
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,880
of that is due to the

657
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,079
sunscreen effect that you get from being

658
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,159
pigmented

659
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,599
but pseudomonas ringi often had many

660
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
other neighbors

661
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,519
and when we look at the neighbors of

662
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,319
pseudomonas regional leaf we find that

663
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,279
around 12 percent of other species

664
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,480
produce the same signal molecule the

665
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,440
three

666
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,839
the same three oxoloxanoel homocerine

667
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,679
lactone one of the more

668
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,279
quorum sensing signal molecules that

669
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,600
bacteria use

670
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,279
so around 12 percent make the same

671
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,038
signal as cerinvi

672
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,119
but around eight percent have a

673
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,279
mysterious ability to inhibit the

674
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,599
production or perception

675
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,158
of the signal molecule by sediment

676
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,158
australia

677
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,679
well given that we were very interested

678
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:51,359
to know well

679
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,120
could these neighbors then be

680
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,918
influencing the

681
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,439
virulence of pseudomonas maggie because

682
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,520
this virulence is in fact

683
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
directly driven by the quorum sensing

684
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,839
mechanism

685
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
and the answer was definitely yes that

686
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,240
uh

687
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,480
show an example this strain or when you

688
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,159
strain ft1 which is one that made a

689
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,640
large amount of the

690
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,200
same signal molecule with cinema surgery

691
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,280
and i might

692
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
note that for whatever reason they made

693
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,158
about a hundred times more

694
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
than pseudomonas did in its own right

695
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,840
and look at though

696
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,798
this simple express spray and pretty

697
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,480
experiment we use

698
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,158
the inoculation of the minus 3d by

699
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,240
itself count how many lesions 35 lesions

700
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,919
when inoculated together with the wendy

701
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,279
and the amount of infections went way

702
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,480
down

703
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,519
and when we we couldn't because of this

704
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,200
competition for signaling but in fact

705
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,200
when we blocked the ability of the

706
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
awning strain to produce the signal by

707
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,640
introducing

708
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,200
an ahl lactinase which basically

709
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,919
destroyed the signal molecule

710
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,798
its ability to grow but not able to

711
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,720
produce the

712
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,558
signal molecule then you see that its

713
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,600
presence without the signaling

714
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,558
capability

715
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,759
had again no effect on the pathogen so

716
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,558
it did seem like the overwhelming

717
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,879
presidency

718
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,079
was the reason why that neighbor could

719
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,960
in fact produce

720
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,678
signaling suggesting that we might be

721
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,240
able to exploit this phenomenon by

722
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,798
having competitors that could produce

723
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,440
signal molecules who inhibit the growth

724
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,400
and variance if you would of pathogens

725
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,400
for which signaling is important

726
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,798
but the opposite is also true and that

727
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,038
we had strains that

728
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,319
interfered with pseudomonas ringing

729
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,480
signaling

730
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,798
pseudomonas by itself made some lesions

731
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,640
we made a lot more infection when

732
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:45,440
the in the signaling interference strain

733
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,278
was co-inoculated with syringe again a

734
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,038
mutant of that strain which blocked its

735
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,880
ability to interfere

736
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,119
now we see no real effect of its

737
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,278
presence so in fact

738
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,798
neighbors of cinema syringe can actually

739
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,599
increase disease

740
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,119
so facilitation of disease by neighbors

741
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,158
on a plant is also

742
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,079
quite possible and it gets even more

743
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
complicated because it turns out that

744
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,000
plants themselves

745
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,839
can perceive the signal molecules that

746
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,880
these potential pathogens

747
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,000
are producing and it may be that many

748
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,559
plants are in fact

749
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,720
actually listening into the signaling

750
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,839
that pathogens are using to

751
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,558
gear up to express virulence traits

752
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,240
to infect that plant and we now know

753
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:32,158
that the plants might be

754
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,400
anticipating disease by listening in

755
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,480
and appropriately regulating their

756
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
potential responses to the pathogen

757
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,640
well we've been interested in what are

758
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,798
the adaptations needed for bacteria to

759
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
live in and on plants

760
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,400
uh the bacteria live on plants are very

761
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,600
distinct from those in the soil and

762
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
we're going to come back to that in a

763
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,480
minute

764
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,559
but basically what does it take to live

765
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
on a plant at least today in california

766
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,720
i hear it's raining in ithaca

767
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
but here in california it's sunny and

768
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,200
warm and smoky

769
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
microbes on the leaf surface have many

770
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
stresses they've got to deal with

771
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,599
desiccation

772
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,440
and other things that are going on but

773
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,000
plants these same pathogens certainly

774
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,278
can enter

775
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,119
and start to multiply within a plant

776
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,839
and within the tissues the apoplasts

777
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,599
have probably different requirements for

778
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,158
exploitation of that plant than those

779
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,639
that need it to grow on this leaf

780
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,240
well pseudomonas serenity strained b720a

781
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
the one we've done a lot of work on over

782
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,640
the years was one of the first to be

783
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,000
sequenced by

784
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,919
jgi and we've been able to do exploit

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,359
that to look at the transcriptomics of

786
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,919
this to really look to see

787
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,119
what are those traits that are at least

788
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,278
expressed

789
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,038
uh on the leaf surface and tyler when he

790
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,640
was a student actually looked at

791
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,319
what was the importance of those traits

792
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,278
in actual fitness but i'll let him tell

793
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,399
you about that

794
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,480
in another story but we looked at the

795
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
the gene expression of the bacteria

796
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
under various conditions in the

797
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
laboratory and

798
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,159
the first disappointment was the fact

799
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,000
that basically

800
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
no condition that we could look at

801
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,839
in the culture with low nitrogen

802
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
peroxide present the kind of conditions

803
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,038
that we

804
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,000
thought might mimic the leaf surface the

805
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:13,519
gene expression

806
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,079
patterns were very very different from

807
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,158
what we would see on the leaf

808
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,278
so it kind of suggests that much of what

809
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,399
we've been trying to do

810
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,839
in the laboratory for since microbiology

811
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,119
started isn't really

812
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,119
very appropriate because there's a very

813
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,278
plant specific pattern of gene

814
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,079
expression that we can now get at with

815
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,519
the

816
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,199
transcriptomics that we're going to talk

817
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,798
about now

818
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,399
so i don't just highlight a few of the

819
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,158
things that we saw by looking at the

820
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,199
expression of all the genes of cinema

821
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,440
serengeti

822
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,038
first in the epithetic conditions and

823
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,240
those are in the red bars what are the

824
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,240
traits that were

825
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,480
particularly prominently expressed on

826
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,640
the on the leaf surface

827
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,360
flagellar motility basically anything

828
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
about motility and chemotaxis were

829
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,798
certainly upregulated on the leaf

830
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,919
surface compared to

831
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:04,798
any kind of condition in the interior or

832
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,320
on any kind of a culture medium

833
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,960
and a couple of other things that really

834
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,278
struck us were things like uh tryptophan

835
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
uh synthesis and i'm gonna come back to

836
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,440
talk about that in a minute

837
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,599
one of the things that we're typically

838
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
strongly upregulated when they're inside

839
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,158
and that's going to be the green virus

840
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,840
here

841
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
various toxins and there's been a lot of

842
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,119
interest in various toxins made by

843
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,398
uh cinnamon cereal various phytotoxins

844
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,239
sergio myosin cerealite

845
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,678
these were certainly upregulated on the

846
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,480
inside of the plant but

847
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,600
also on the surface suggesting that

848
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,200
these toxins may

849
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,038
also play a role in perhaps changing the

850
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,038
chemical or physical environment of the

851
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,798
leaf surface

852
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,558
one that was really quite striking on

853
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,480
the other hand were the genes involved

854
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,678
in the production of various compatible

855
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
solutes

856
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:59,519
things like trail of a sugar that's

857
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,520
able to help cells tolerate water stress

858
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,000
and yes we saw those up regulating on

859
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,918
the leaf surface and the red bars

860
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,480
but they were very very strongly up

861
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,399
regulated also on the interior

862
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,000
suggesting very strongly that the

863
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,000
interior of a leaf is actually quite dry

864
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,839
and i think most of us going into this

865
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,440
kind of a study suggested

866
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,038
that the interior i've always thought it

867
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,840
was kind of you know

868
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,200
moist and sugary but it's not it's it's

869
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,079
quite dry

870
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,120
air penetrates into the leaf to allow

871
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,240
the gas exchange for photosynthesis

872
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,759
and we're going to talk about another

873
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,919
tree here in just a second string a

874
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,038
factor the biosurfactant is made by the

875
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,120
bacteria

876
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:42,480
made both on the interior and the

877
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,479
exterior of the plant

878
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,839
we did find though that many of the

879
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,519
trees that are

880
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,359
expressed by pseudomonas seed were

881
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,759
preferentially expressed

882
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,119
either on the interior of the plant or

883
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,038
on the surface but

884
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,879
i just want to follow up on that with

885
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,359
two traits that

886
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,200
made interesting stories one with

887
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,959
tryptophan uh biosynthesis

888
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
and one is this syringe factor and

889
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,880
there's biosurfactant

890
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,278
let's start with the tryptophan story

891
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,039
it turns out that basically almost every

892
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,519
microbe that you ever recover from a

893
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,000
plant

894
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:20,079
has the ability to produce the plant

895
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,079
hormone three endo acetic acid

896
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,320
it's very striking that very few

897
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,679
bacteria from other habitats have this

898
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,879
ability

899
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,679
uh but virtually all plant microbes do

900
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,760
and that that leads us back to

901
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,480
tryptophan tryptophan is the ultimate

902
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,319
source for

903
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,480
three and all acetic acid which you see

904
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,480
in the middle of this pathway

905
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,960
and various plant pathogens have the

906
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,679
ability to convert tryptophan into oia

907
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,679
avia this intermediate

908
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,000
endulocetamide but we find that most

909
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,798
non-pathogens and a lot of pathogens as

910
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,960
well

911
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,918
use this central pathway from indole

912
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,440
pyruvic acid to endoacetylide

913
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,720
into iaa but the real question is why

914
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,720
did the bacteria

915
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,200
all produce oxygen and this is just

916
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,399
document that no matter what taxes you

917
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,720
look at

918
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,319
almost all of them make some and many

919
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,440
make an awful lot

920
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,200
of three and all acetic acid

921
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,880
it turns out that they make enough that

922
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,880
they actually account for some of the

923
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,360
phenotypes that we typically associate

924
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,880
with the plant itself things like

925
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,119
flour and fruit obsession classical

926
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,679
oxen-mediated

927
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,199
phenotype and a phenomenon we've been

928
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
studying a lot because of its

929
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,480
commercial importance in california is

930
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,518
this phenomenon called

931
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,360
fruit russeting where we know that the

932
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,519
presence of high numbers of oxen

933
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,959
producing bacteria on the fruit with a

934
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,359
very small

935
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,038
centimeter or someone in diameter in the

936
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,479
early spring

937
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,558
uh change the apparently change that the

938
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,159
the development of the epidermal cells

939
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,440
of the fruit such that

940
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,600
they die early and produces quirky dead

941
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,038
cell reset that we see on the surface of

942
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,599
the fruit

943
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,640
the fruit don't store quite as well they

944
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,359
don't look as

945
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,799
appealing to other consumers like you

946
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,759
see the fruit on the right an apartment

947
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:09,679
pair

948
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,879
uh so growers actually suffer

949
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,600
substantially

950
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,840
because of the lower value of these that

951
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:19,439
go into making baby foods rather than

952
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,519
going on the shelf again auxin can

953
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,038
also be used as a signaling molecule and

954
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,720
this has been well studied in

955
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,480
agrobacterium and others

956
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,240
it's not clear whether it's a signaling

957
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,159
molecule of its own right

958
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,399
and other plant associated bacteria but

959
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,000
there's some potential

960
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,759
but what i want to talk about with the

961
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,119
story of what i'm going to call resource

962
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,200
conversion

963
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,359
another reason why the bacteria would

964
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,038
make auxin

965
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,798
and we knew that producing oxygen was

966
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,398
very important to the microbes and that

967
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,558
when we made mutes of

968
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,319
this case of linear herbicola very

969
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,240
common epiphyte

970
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,879
uh to block its ability to produce

971
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,440
oxygen and we put a mutant mixture

972
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,399
a mutant unable to produce a signal with

973
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,798
the uh

974
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,599
wild type strain but the mixture on a

975
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:03,519
plant

976
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,959
came back various times after we put

977
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,359
them on a planet look at the

978
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,519
rate change in the ratio it started out

979
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,918
wild type and it increased dramatically

980
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,599
to favor the wild type after

981
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,960
a few generations on the plant

982
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,119
suggesting that

983
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,319
in fact it was very important to be

984
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,558
making oxen but why

985
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,359
well to think back again to the nutrient

986
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:27,519
story and

987
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,359
thinking that it looks like carbon does

988
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,120
limit the amount of growth that microbes

989
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,199
have on a plant

990
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,518
the simple model would be that by some

991
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,679
way the presence of oxygen produced from

992
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,200
production on leaf surface cause

993
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,798
nutrients to release

994
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
to be released from the inside of the

995
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,918
plant upon the leaf surface

996
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,120
again it has to cross the cuticle and

997
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,559
there would be different

998
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,798
ways in which that might be mediated

999
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,639
so we started up to test this model then

1000
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,038
to see whether in fact

1001
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,159
in the presence of auxin would the

1002
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,480
bacteria see

1003
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,200
more sugar does oxen production somehow

1004
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,240
release

1005
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,919
sugar onto the leaf surface and again

1006
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,759
we're going to use biosensors that we

1007
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,918
developed before in this case one for

1008
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,918
the detection of sucrose

1009
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,679
sucrose being the most abundant carbon

1010
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,078
source on most plants

1011
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,079
so we take a fr a sucrose responsive

1012
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,599
promoter link in this case to a

1013
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,480
promoter-less ice gene ice nucleation

1014
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,240
genes

1015
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,079
single genes are capable of for the

1016
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,319
isonucleation phenotype

1017
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,280
ice nucleation is a very very very

1018
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,000
sensitive

1019
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,399
uh i reporter gene because of ease for

1020
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,878
which it's detected so we're going to

1021
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,759
now look for

1022
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,199
sucrose-dependent production of ice

1023
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,879
nucleation in

1024
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,799
a strain in which we would put this

1025
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,799
reporter gene that whether

1026
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,599
otherwise would not have been capable of

1027
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,599
production of ice nuclei

1028
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,119
and we came kept coming up with the

1029
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,399
wrong answer so to speak

1030
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,480
um you know supposed to have

1031
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,519
anticipations but in this case a

1032
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,480
depression is not

1033
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,400
a ox in this case a synthetic oxen

1034
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,119
nepali acetic acid

1035
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,280
we actually see less ice nuclei

1036
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,920
apparently the bacteria are seeing

1037
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,920
less sucrose in the presence of the

1038
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,559
auxin than they did

1039
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
uh when there was no oxygen present

1040
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,320
inclined they're more active than the

1041
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,159
one with the green line so we did it

1042
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
many times we always got the same answer

1043
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,519
less apparent sucrose in the presence of

1044
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,598
auxin

1045
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,199
we already had the sensor for fructose

1046
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,320
that i showed you before a gfp

1047
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,000
reporter and there we see that in fact

1048
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,680
in the presence of oxen we do

1049
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,920
see apparently much more fructose being

1050
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,639
made available in the presence of oxen

1051
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,400
no oxen with oxen

1052
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,679
so confusing but it made more sense when

1053
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,160
we started to think about what's

1054
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,279
actually

1055
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,879
happening on a plant so go back to one

1056
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,079
of the very early tables that i showed

1057
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,119
you with there was

1058
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,560
10 micrograms of sugar

1059
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,480
on a typical bean leaf well a bean leaf

1060
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,279
in the morning after a dew had formed

1061
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,679
there might be

1062
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,880
a milliliter or a dew that would form on

1063
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,000
a leaf

1064
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,320
and you think about what's the

1065
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,358
concentration of that sugar that would

1066
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,559
be present

1067
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:13,279
it's going to be we're talking

1068
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:15,039
milligrams per liter of nutrient

1069
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,560
concentration just

1070
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,880
tiny concentrations of these sugars

1071
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,719
now the bacteria have to actively uptake

1072
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,760
these sugars to be able to consume

1073
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,078
and multiply and there are different

1074
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,240
uptake mechanisms for disaccharides

1075
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,320
than there are for monosaccharides like

1076
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,319
fructose and glucose

1077
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,640
so we asked whether the bacteria could

1078
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,200
actually consume and grow

1079
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,679
at the low concentrations of these

1080
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:45,118
sugars that they would probably see

1081
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:47,759
in the real world an answer was quite

1082
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,039
obvious that they could consume fructose

1083
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,480
at very very low

1084
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,079
concentrations like 0.05 milligrams per

1085
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,159
liter just

1086
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,119
tiny amounts of sugar were enough for

1087
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,679
them to

1088
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,800
perceive and grow sucrose on the other

1089
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,759
hand it took

1090
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,039
10 to 100 times more sugar before they

1091
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,920
could even

1092
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,519
grow on that as a carbon source and

1093
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,159
further support of that would be

1094
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,239
measurement of the basically the

1095
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,118
metabolic activity of the cells and the

1096
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,639
same kind of

1097
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,440
very low concentrations and we test that

1098
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,118
with the

1099
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,639
cell wall synthesis inhibitor

1100
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,280
cycloserine like

1101
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,639
like penicillin it will block cell wall

1102
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,560
synthesis and thereby

1103
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,118
kill the bacteria only if the cells are

1104
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,480
in fact

1105
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,039
growing and it turned out that yes

1106
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,159
indeed

1107
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,719
the cells are sensitive to cycloserine

1108
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,759
at these very very low concentrations

1109
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:46,078
whereas you can see with sucrose much

1110
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,280
higher concentrations of sucrose were

1111
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,800
needed before cells became sufficiently

1112
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,960
metabolically active

1113
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,359
trying to grow and were then poisoned by

1114
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,519
a cycloserine

1115
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,358
so it would seem then that in fact

1116
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,800
carbon is in fact very limited on the

1117
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,960
leaf surface but

1118
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,880
that they are probably not directly

1119
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,800
consuming sucrose they're probably

1120
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,079
consuming primarily

1121
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,280
these more easily consumable

1122
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,240
glucose and fructose and that our work

1123
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,160
didn't really

1124
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,679
get to the point of showing but somehow

1125
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,559
the presence of iaa is

1126
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:23,440
going to activate these cell wall

1127
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,960
invertases that are present in plants

1128
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,880
that are now going to be making that

1129
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,800
conversion to

1130
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
convert sucrose into glucose and

1131
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,599
fructose

1132
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
there's a variety of these syllable

1133
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,440
invertases

1134
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,519
the various mutants that we've tested we

1135
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,480
didn't find one particular one but it

1136
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,358
would appear that there

1137
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,199
is one of the many cellular inverters

1138
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,559
that are in fact induced

1139
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,598
by the presence of iaea

1140
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,119
now another story i want to give you

1141
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,200
again something that's happening that we

1142
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,440
think on a very small scale on these is

1143
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,838
the role of

1144
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,240
biosurfactants and one of the

1145
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,159
traits that many uh microbes that live

1146
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,000
on plants have is the ability to produce

1147
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,879
these bio surfactants these are

1148
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,639
detergent like molecules amphipathic

1149
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,720
molecules where we have typically a

1150
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,319
polar head group usually some sort of a

1151
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:16,319
peptide linked to a nasal chain

1152
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,079
which is very detergent like very high

1153
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,400
def very hydrophilic

1154
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,440
head ceriufactin is one such bios effect

1155
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,320
that is uh produced by

1156
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,800
pseudomonas serenity and our work with

1157
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
new

1158
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,240
methods to detect biosurfactant

1159
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,559
production in bacteria as a whole

1160
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,000
revealed that

1161
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,960
biophysical production was particularly

1162
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,519
prominent among

1163
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,159
bacteria on plants compared to other

1164
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,079
kind of

1165
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,920
settings like soil and water and so on

1166
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,320
well what do these biosurfactants being

1167
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,159
do certainly they might act as a

1168
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,480
detergent to be wood and

1169
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,319
and simply disperse water on this very

1170
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,159
waxy surface

1171
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,240
but we found actually that it seemed to

1172
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,759
have two particular traits that are

1173
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,919
even bacteria

1174
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,400
and one is that it seems to be able to

1175
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,519
alter the permeability of this waxy

1176
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,318
cuticle that

1177
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,480
covers most plants so again there's a

1178
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:13,519
waxy cuticle made up of a variety of

1179
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,318
materials

1180
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,838
which blocks not only the loose loss of

1181
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,759
water from the plant

1182
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,838
but would also block the movement of any

1183
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,200
kind of polar molecules like sugars up

1184
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,440
onto the surface of the plant

1185
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,358
now working with a group in germany uh

1186
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,400
professor schreiber

1187
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,239
you could peel off at the dermal peels

1188
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,920
which would contain the cuticle put them

1189
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,318
on the surface of a

1190
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,159
basically tritiated water and we could

1191
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:44,400
watch the diffusion of tritium

1192
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:46,318
across that cuticle and again an intact

1193
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,720
cuticle there's a very slow movement of

1194
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,880
trivium but when we put then

1195
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,959
bios effect on this case ring effect and

1196
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,358
onto the surface of that cuticle

1197
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,800
immediately the greater movement of the

1198
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,480
tritium across that

1199
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,240
cuticle increased so simplistically i

1200
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,159
simply see it essentially dissolving

1201
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,959
that cuticle as disrupting it in some

1202
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,358
way

1203
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,559
to make it more permeable to polar

1204
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:13,679
molecules or maybe even water themselves

1205
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,000
to probably very beneficial effect of

1206
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,598
the bacteria

1207
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,039
now one of the other interesting

1208
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,240
features of a lot of these bio

1209
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,639
surfactants including ceram is that

1210
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,838
they're very hygroscopic that these

1211
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:30,480
uh various groups on the polar end are

1212
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,679
able to engage in hydrogen bonding with

1213
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,559
water

1214
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:37,039
and it makes it very very hygroscopic

1215
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:40,480
and at high relative humidity

1216
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,279
these materials will bind large volumes

1217
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,318
of water

1218
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,000
several times their mass and water are

1219
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,838
bound by these types of material

1220
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,519
so we immediately thought of this as

1221
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,279
something that would be very beneficial

1222
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,440
to a bacterium and we'd always thought

1223
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,880
of desiccation stress being

1224
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,960
perhaps one of the most important

1225
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,000
stresses that microbes on a leaf would

1226
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,240
face

1227
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,400
these are drying much of the time and

1228
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:08,000
they have to survive this

1229
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,358
periodic and prolonged desiccation

1230
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,079
now i mentioned these compatible

1231
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:15,039
solutions before as cells

1232
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,400
of all organisms experience low water

1233
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,719
availability

1234
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,559
they often accumulate these so-called

1235
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,879
compatible solutes

1236
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,279
and among the compatible solutes is the

1237
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,838
amino acid proline

1238
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,000
the more dry the cells would be the more

1239
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:33,119
proline they're going to want to make

1240
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,760
so gwen beatty developed a very nice

1241
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,358
biosensor for water stress if you would

1242
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,480
taking advantage of the fact that we

1243
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,199
could examine

1244
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,039
the expression of the pro-u one of the

1245
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,159
regulators the proline biosynthesis

1246
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,039
linked to again

1247
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,078
a green fluorescent protein reporter

1248
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,159
gene

1249
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,000
the drier the cells the higher the

1250
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,358
expression of prolene genes

1251
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,079
and the greener the cells are going to

1252
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:58,400
be so introducing this

1253
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,400
reporter into a wild-type stream but

1254
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,160
also a strain that was blocked

1255
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,318
in its ability to produce a string

1256
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,960
effect on the biosurfactant

1257
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,920
we could then recover the cells after

1258
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,400
different conditions on

1259
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,920
dry leaves each one of these little dots

1260
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,559
is how green

1261
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,318
the individual cells were we're looking

1262
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,400
at the greenness from left to right and

1263
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,039
the fraction of cells exhibit

1264
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,440
that greenness and you can see that as a

1265
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,400
whole the wild type strains are much

1266
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,720
less green than the mutant which is what

1267
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,160
they

1268
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,559
unable to accumulate the bios effect

1269
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,399
so basically these cells are drier it

1270
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,920
does appear then if there is sufficient

1271
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,160
bios effect

1272
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,240
made by the bacterium that they're

1273
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,159
essentially making a small

1274
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,919
aqueous zone if you would around the

1275
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,118
bacteria by either

1276
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,440
attracting water in the form of vapor

1277
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,318
that would probably serve on the in the

1278
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,400
leaf surface a laminar layer of

1279
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:57,838
relatively humid air would surround a

1280
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,480
dry leaf

1281
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,719
that might be extracted as liquid water

1282
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,719
onto the surface of bacteria

1283
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,959
or it might actually hold on to water

1284
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:10,239
when the leaf was eventually

1285
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,920
intermittently wet but nonetheless it

1286
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,759
does appear that it is a very important

1287
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,079
survival

1288
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,440
factor for the bacterium because

1289
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,599
compared to the uh

1290
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,280
wild-type strain mutants that were

1291
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,559
blocked into production of

1292
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,480
cerinofactin and then exposed to four or

1293
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,799
five of these wet dry

1294
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,679
patterns typical of a wet a day night

1295
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,640
cycle

1296
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,838
so that the mutant was much less capable

1297
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,039
of survival compared to the wild-type

1298
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,759
strain so again it looks like

1299
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,960
a very localized wedding if you would of

1300
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,040
the bacteria

1301
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,480
the spring effect i'm shown by the balls

1302
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,880
and tails here

1303
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,240
are attracting enough water that the

1304
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,559
bacterium is going to

1305
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:54,159
benefit from that wetter location

1306
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,480
so i'm going to finish by just a couple

1307
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,639
of bigger issues so everything we've

1308
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,199
talked about so far is happening

1309
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,679
at a very small scale the world is a

1310
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,159
very big place to a very tiny bacterium

1311
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,519
and

1312
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,279
everything that's important to that

1313
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,920
bacteria is probably very

1314
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
localized but the real question is how

1315
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
do we get the microbes on the leaves

1316
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,480
that we

1317
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,318
see on the leaves and i mentioned before

1318
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
that when plants

1319
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,639
first emerge into the world they're

1320
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,960
usually almost devoid of bacteria

1321
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,279
here's a image from one of my thesis

1322
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,480
some you can see how long ago

1323
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,560
they're showing that all these different

1324
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,318
kind of plants growing in wisconsin

1325
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,159
there are very very few bacteria on the

1326
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,039
plants early and the bacteria

1327
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,920
then accumulate within a few days to a

1328
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,599
week or two

1329
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,960
to much much higher levels surprising

1330
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,960
given that these all plants were

1331
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,760
emerging through the soil

1332
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,639
there was lots of soil-borne organisms

1333
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,800
but in fact

1334
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,400
they did not seem to colonize the plant

1335
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,640
surface

1336
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,639
and we recently did a study where we

1337
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,559
looked at microbes that we recovered

1338
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,000
from bean leaves and compared those to

1339
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,400
soil organisms

1340
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,719
near the bean plants in the field and

1341
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,280
some rhizosphere microbes from the

1342
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,480
same plants and we put them through that

1343
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,319
typical

1344
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,559
stressful condition that a plant would

1345
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,519
see inoculated those leaf isolates for

1346
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,318
example

1347
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,920
let them grow under a wet leaf for a day

1348
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,920
then let them dry measure how many

1349
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,159
bacteria could grow up and survive

1350
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,960
and then expose them to wet excuse me to

1351
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,838
dry

1352
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,679
conditions with uv light and see how

1353
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,759
many could survive and again enumerate

1354
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,759
how many microbes we saw

1355
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,200
we then looked at it how what was the

1356
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,880
fate of those cells compared what they

1357
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,679
were when they were wet compared to what

1358
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,039
they were

1359
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,519
after they went through this drying

1360
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,880
condition and you could see the leaf

1361
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,358
microbes

1362
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,400
if anything often grew even during these

1363
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:43,838
wet conditions

1364
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,760
the difference between the wet and the

1365
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,239
dry was actually a net

1366
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,960
increase in population some just kind of

1367
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,679
held their population and only a few

1368
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,159
were losers where they actually died and

1369
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,838
lowered populations after they were wet

1370
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,719
you compared that with say the rise of

1371
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,759
their strength almost all of those

1372
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:06,078
decreased the population size they died

1373
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
by the time they got to the condition

1374
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,960
that a cell would have seen in the real

1375
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,598
world

1376
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,599
so it appeared then that while many

1377
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,480
micros might live on a plant

1378
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,880
under these optimum conditions being wet

1379
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,559
they do not have the capability of

1380
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
of surviving in the plants when they

1381
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,040
become dry and that might be one of the

1382
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,519
conditions that really typifies an

1383
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:27,519
epiphany

1384
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
and another thing that we observed in

1385
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,559
our early work with biological control

1386
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,119
actually was that there is probably a

1387
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,559
limitation of the rate of immigration of

1388
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:44,079
microbes two leaves that dictates

1389
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:46,400
the process of colonization

1390
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,920
and it may be that only some microbes

1391
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,680
are actually capable of growing on a

1392
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,159
plant and they have to get those

1393
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,159
particular microbes to a plant

1394
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:55,199
before the colonization process can

1395
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:56,480
start

1396
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,399
we're going to look again at these

1397
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,159
flowers remember they were virtually

1398
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,160
sterile when they emerged

1399
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,358
and you looked at flowers in the orchard

1400
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:05,519
here

1401
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,318
that the population size as a whole

1402
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:10,318
increased after the flowers opened

1403
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,880
only fairly slowly and even after a

1404
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:16,000
couple of weeks the population sizes

1405
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,480
had still not reached very high numbers

1406
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,280
if we inoculated even just a few cells

1407
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,960
of a good

1408
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,960
plant colonists like pseudomonas

1409
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,960
fluorescens you see that those

1410
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,800
populations increased rapidly and the

1411
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,679
population sizes

1412
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,640
that these flowers could ultimately

1413
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,318
harbor

1414
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:36,879
about a million or so cells per flower

1415
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,558
was one or two orders of magnitude

1416
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,358
higher than they typically

1417
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,880
did harbor at a given time so it was

1418
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,039
like those flowers were sitting there

1419
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,920
saying colonize may colonize me but they

1420
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,000
couldn't

1421
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,599
because the right immigrants didn't make

1422
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,838
its way to the flower

1423
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,920
to enable that process to start

1424
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,679
so this kind of gives us some pause

1425
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,039
about what is happening in the real

1426
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,159
world and how it will differ in a

1427
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:03,279
context-dependent way

1428
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,199
i'm going to come back to this in a

1429
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,160
minute but basically this is kind of the

1430
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,639
way

1431
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,598
many of the plants in the world now come

1432
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,480
into the into

1433
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,079
being from seeds and huge fields with

1434
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,800
herbicides so that there's only in this

1435
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,839
case little

1436
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,079
corn seedlings with who knows where

1437
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,519
any other kind of plant colonists would

1438
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,640
ever make its way to these kind of

1439
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,358
plants

1440
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,879
compared to a more diversified setting

1441
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,719
or even natural settings where you'd

1442
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,760
have a lot of vegetation around at all

1443
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,759
times

1444
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,520
and a new plant coming into this world

1445
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,359
is potentially going to have a

1446
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,599
very different and probably a much

1447
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:41,199
higher number of potential

1448
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,800
immigrants so again leaf surfaces and

1449
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:45,838
flowers are what we would call an

1450
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,200
open microbiological habitat

1451
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,880
you're going to think of these flowers

1452
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,358
on these apple trees

1453
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,280
where is the inoculum going to come from

1454
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,880
to colonize those we know they're not

1455
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,720
on the budge of the trees they're

1456
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,640
certainly not in the flowers

1457
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,039
but in this setting you see these cover

1458
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,558
crop between these trees these grasses

1459
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,159
in california they've been growing all

1460
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,000
winter long they had

1461
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,519
millions of bacteria on every little

1462
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,679
leaf blade

1463
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,719
they could easily move from this

1464
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:15,358
vegetation nearby up into the trees

1465
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,639
so how much in what role does

1466
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,400
immigration play in this process

1467
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,480
so we've been reintegrating interest in

1468
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,880
this whole process of aerobiology and in

1469
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,838
this

1470
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,400
era of covid i think we all should be

1471
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:28,960
kind of

1472
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,800
interested in this and there's how many

1473
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,519
microbes are moving around in

1474
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,400
tiny particles in the air how important

1475
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:36,719
is that in

1476
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,639
human health or in this case what's the

1477
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,439
role of these particles in the air in

1478
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,799
terms of

1479
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,079
plant colonization so we did a simple

1480
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,599
experiment berkeley

1481
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,000
right on the eastern edge of san

1482
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,280
francisco bay from our lab we look at

1483
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,838
through the golden gate bridge to the

1484
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,599
pacific ocean and the air blows from the

1485
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,318
west almost all the time towards

1486
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,200
berkeley and it hasn't seen a plant

1487
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,920
since the last

1488
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:04,960
asia so we went down to the edges

1489
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,599
by vacuuming air through our filters

1490
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,159
and then we vacuumed the air at the same

1491
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,160
location

1492
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,519
but about 30 meters inland after the

1493
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,838
eric passed over

1494
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,159
some vegetation we're going to look at

1495
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,719
the numbers and types of bacteria in the

1496
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:19,519
air by

1497
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,959
enumerating the dna signatures of the

1498
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,960
microbes that we collected on those

1499
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,358
filters

1500
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,559
and it was striking to me anyway that

1501
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,199
even after just

1502
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,920
100 feet of you would 30 meters inland

1503
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,919
from

1504
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,720
the bay when the air first saw plants

1505
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,280
that there was around six to ten times

1506
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,719
more bacteria in the air

1507
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,280
and when you looked at the types of

1508
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,598
bacteria that we recovered on that air

1509
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,519
and there's a whole group of different

1510
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,519
bacterial taxes that you would typically

1511
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,599
find in the air

1512
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,440
and compare the upwind air with the

1513
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,920
micros we recovered on the plants and

1514
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,318
the

1515
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,358
microbes that we found in the downwind

1516
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,119
air

1517
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,199
and you'll see that comparing this group

1518
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,440
with this group that the downwind air

1519
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,039
looks a lot more like the plants

1520
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,119
and the downwind area doesn't look very

1521
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,358
much like the upwind here

1522
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,039
and that particular taxa like pentoya

1523
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,960
which is a very prominent

1524
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,960
plant colonizer is very abundant on

1525
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,358
plants but also a major

1526
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,000
factor in the downward air hardly

1527
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:21,679
detectable in the upland air

1528
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,079
so it really looks like the air just

1529
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,639
being infused by these plant colonies

1530
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,720
like sphingomonas same story

1531
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,799
that the plants are releasing bacteria

1532
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:34,239
very efficiently into the air

1533
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,359
there is basically now a mobile

1534
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,519
reservoir of these

1535
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,519
oculum that could move around and then

1536
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,719
those could then be deposited

1537
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,280
onto other plants and it would then seem

1538
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,919
like

1539
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,000
even fat plants do vary in the types of

1540
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,480
microbes that they do support and that

1541
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,559
is true beans here have different ones

1542
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,838
from grass and so on

1543
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,440
that a given plant might have a very

1544
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,358
different type of a microflora that

1545
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,440
would eventually develop on it

1546
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,639
as a function of what is the source of

1547
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,960
inoculum

1548
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,519
for that i'm not going to come to the

1549
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,358
leaves to colonize

1550
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,880
so i took it down into the fact that my

1551
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,759
brother has

1552
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,000
been a farmer in oregon where i grew up

1553
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,920
he

1554
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,400
grows uh grass in this case tall fescue

1555
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,760
a crimson clover and wheat are some of

1556
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,800
his major crops

1557
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,200
grows them in large homogeneous steels

1558
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,240
and so i took a particular target plant

1559
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,318
in this case i took

1560
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,598
uh tall fescue plants that grow on the

1561
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,279
greenhouse

1562
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,200
we transplanted them into the middle of

1563
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,000
this tall fescue fields his clover

1564
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,558
fields

1565
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,920
his wheat fields and then came back a

1566
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,839
few weeks later to look at the

1567
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,358
communities that developed on that tall

1568
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:45,119
fescue

1569
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:46,480
and if the plant itself was really the

1570
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,400
driver of what ended up

1571
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,599
growing on the leaves of the tall fescue

1572
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,039
we would have thought

1573
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,519
that the toll fescue would have had

1574
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:56,639
similar communities on it no matter

1575
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:59,280
what its local environment was

1576
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,400
but the pco plotted you see upper and

1577
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,480
ever right

1578
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,519
you'll see that the communities on the

1579
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,039
grass

1580
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,519
plants are very different from ones in

1581
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,119
the clover and the ones in the wheat

1582
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,960
that it was very very different that

1583
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,920
there were different types of microbes

1584
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,199
that could live

1585
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,880
on tall fescue and it seemed then to be

1586
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,519
driven by you know what was

1587
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,640
the first and most organisms that would

1588
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,039
be arriving

1589
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:25,679
at that tall fiscu was going to be the

1590
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,679
dominant colonizer

1591
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,000
and this can fits into what another

1592
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,159
group looking at seaweeds and

1593
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,599
the ocean off of australia came up what

1594
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,838
they call the competitory

1595
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,160
competitive lottery bottle of community

1596
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:39,519
assembly

1597
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,358
and you can just read the bottom line

1598
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:44,159
from their their

1599
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:46,239
story showing that basically species

1600
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,399
with similar ecological properties are

1601
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,879
able to occupy the same dish

1602
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,559
that is a variety of microbes can live

1603
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,640
on leaf surfaces

1604
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,480
and the ones that would end up being

1605
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:59,519
there are going to be determined by this

1606
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,559
stochastic recruitment the stochastic

1607
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:05,519
recruitment to me

1608
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:07,359
says the way we manage plants

1609
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,519
management practices can have a huge

1610
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,558
effect on the kind of communities we

1611
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,039
find on our plants

1612
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,480
and a practical implication of this has

1613
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,318
been other work that we've been doing

1614
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,240
and i won't show you all the results

1615
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,759
but grapes grapes are a big deal in

1616
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,479
northern california grapes are very

1617
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,960
subject to freezing

1618
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,480
temperatures in the spring there isn't

1619
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,960
enough water available to

1620
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,240
protect the plants against the freezing

1621
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,920
we've been able to show that the

1622
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,399
microbial communities and the grapes in

1623
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,039
this

1624
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,639
left-hand side of this large field where

1625
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,759
we had removed the vegetation of

1626
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:39,440
herbicide

1627
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,799
were very different from the microbes

1628
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,280
and the grapes when

1629
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,358
we allowed the cover crops to grow in

1630
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,880
this case there's many fewer isolating

1631
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,279
bacteria here

1632
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,160
than over here and that again simply by

1633
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,920
changing the local

1634
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:55,279
microbiological context of those plants

1635
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,079
we can have a very

1636
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,079
big effect on

1637
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,639
vein we did a large experiment a few

1638
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,920
years ago

1639
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:08,159
a cooperating grower let us use about an

1640
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,838
80 hectare or pear orchard we divide it

1641
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,199
up into large numbers of relatively

1642
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,519
large blocks

1643
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:16,078
where we plant a particular species of

1644
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:18,719
plants as cover crops under them

1645
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,720
so we have a large randomized block just

1646
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,480
part of what you see here

1647
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:25,199
and we came back and we measured two

1648
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,000
different things we measured

1649
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:29,598
the amount of airborne bacteria within a

1650
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,519
particular block

1651
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,359
so each one of these little blocks was

1652
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,119
about uh

1653
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,199
three acres in size and there was five

1654
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,599
replicas of each little block

1655
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,639
so this is the number of bacterial cells

1656
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,160
deposited per

1657
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,679
petri dish per hour we brought up large

1658
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,519
numbers of undergraduates and

1659
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:49,519
we all synchronized our watches and at

1660
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:50,400
the exact same time open them up for an

1661
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,079
hour

1662
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,838
in an area where there was different

1663
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,119
mixed weeds and grasses

1664
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,519
compared to where we'd remove the

1665
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,559
vegetation or we had plants that didn't

1666
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:02,480
support very many bacteria as epiphytes

1667
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,079
it's interestingly just like we would

1668
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,838
have shown from the

1669
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,318
aerosol measurements with our dna

1670
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:09,039
devices we see that there was something

1671
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:11,519
like

1672
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,798
four or five times more bacteria in the

1673
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:14,719
air

1674
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,559
in the areas where we had a lot of these

1675
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,959
abundant

1676
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,640
sources of bacteria such as grasses

1677
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,440
pouring under the trees compared to the

1678
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,039
trees

1679
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,720
early on when there were not very many

1680
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,199
bacteria and this

1681
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,000
in turn had a very measurable effect on

1682
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,078
in this case

1683
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,920
fruit wrestling where these oxen

1684
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,318
producing bacteria were

1685
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,200
more abundant early in the development

1686
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,599
of the plants

1687
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:40,798
because of their sources on either the

1688
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:43,280
localized plants nearby

1689
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:44,639
let me just finish by one simple cartoon

1690
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,280
showing that

1691
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,199
the colonization of plants involves many

1692
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,798
processes but these occur at very

1693
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,719
different scales

1694
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,199
in terms of who ends up on the plants

1695
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,439
which are a big part of the story

1696
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,399
this is a very large-scale phenomenon

1697
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,000
where

1698
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,838
immigration from one plant and

1699
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,559
immigration another are

1700
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:06,159
tied processes and these are happening

1701
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,200
at very very large scales

1702
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,798
you know from many meters to maybe

1703
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,239
kilometers of the microbes in a

1704
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:13,599
particular region

1705
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,759
are going to differ and that's going to

1706
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,559
be the sources of an outcome

1707
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,040
for the for the process but after they

1708
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,839
were to

1709
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,199
land on a plant it saw at a very very

1710
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:25,599
small scale

1711
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,519
the bacteria probably do not care what's

1712
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,640
happening even a few millimeters away

1713
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,159
from each other

1714
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,000
on a leaf and that everything that's

1715
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,679
important to the process

1716
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,079
is happening at these very very small

1717
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:39,598
scales and that

1718
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,039
the types of inoculum coming how much

1719
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,480
interactions are happening between the

1720
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,558
bacteria are happening at very very

1721
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,440
small scales

1722
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,040
well i just finished by making a plug

1723
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,000
for what a lot of people are very

1724
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:51,358
interested in these days

1725
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,159
and it's kind of i'm going to call

1726
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,558
agricultural probiotics

1727
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:58,078
but i think it kind of makes that sit

1728
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,079
back and look at the way we do

1729
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,880
agriculture these days you saw a picture

1730
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,720
of the

1731
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,000
you know basically the large naked

1732
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,719
cornfield there's a large

1733
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,039
naked soybean field this is kind of the

1734
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,078
way we do ag anymore large large large

1735
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,920
fields

1736
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,839
long distances from any other kind of

1737
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,920
natural vegetation that

1738
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:17,119
might be part of the normal process by

1739
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,000
which colonization

1740
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,079
happens and i think it's probably

1741
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,798
inhibiting the establishment of a

1742
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,359
normal microflora on these plants and if

1743
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:30,559
the normal microflora is really

1744
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:33,119
important in terms of competition

1745
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,160
with plant pathogens that we're probably

1746
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,559
making our plants

1747
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:38,318
somewhat more susceptible to disease

1748
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,480
kind of inadvertently

1749
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,480
by having these effects on the community

1750
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,240
as itself

1751
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,318
and i think this is one of the reasons

1752
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:49,439
why there's been the effects that we see

1753
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:51,679
on from agricultural probiotics

1754
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,039
inoculating seeds spraying different

1755
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,759
things on the leaves

1756
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,798
there's very often demonstrations that

1757
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,400
we can

1758
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,318
improve plant growth make them more

1759
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,039
resistant to disease and all

1760
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:05,519
by changing the microbiology and i think

1761
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:08,318
that effect is even more pronounced and

1762
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,599
probably dictates the need for some way

1763
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,079
to intervene if we're going to

1764
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,280
keep growing plants in this somewhat

1765
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,000
artificial way

1766
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,920
to kind of restore a normal microbiology

1767
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,358
so to speak

1768
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,200
well i'll stop there and just kind of

1769
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:23,199
give acknowledgement to a lot of people

1770
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,519
doing a lot of great work in the lab

1771
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,159
and i guess we can answer any questions

1772
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:31,119
if you have some

1773
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,920
all right thanks so much steve um it was

1774
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,240
really interesting

1775
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,159
so for questions uh we have time for

1776
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,959
maybe one or two and then i know that at

1777
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:40,838
1 45

1778
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:44,400
we have set aside for a student postdoc

1779
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:46,000
um lunch or meet up or whatever

1780
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,160
so if anyone has any questions and wants

1781
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,358
to write them into the chat

1782
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:53,358
or unmute yourself and ask you can go

1783
01:00:54,838 --> 01:01:00,719
ahead so a question from

1784
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,039
uh joanne uh who asks

1785
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,558
how might other leaf-dwelling microbes

1786
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,639
for example fungi

1787
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,839
affect or contribute to the behaviors

1788
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:12,719
that you're describing for

1789
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:15,519
bacteria very interesting question

1790
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,519
i took out of my slides some pictures of

1791
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:20,318
showing that

1792
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,440
bacteria may actually exploit fungi for

1793
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:23,358
growth

1794
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,720
bacteria really don't penetrate leaves

1795
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,679
very much they're kind of dependent on

1796
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:27,919
this passive

1797
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,960
diffusion of resources on the leaf

1798
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,358
surface

1799
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,720
but it's very common if you do see fungi

1800
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,880
growing on leaf and many

1801
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:35,759
certainly plant pathogenic bacteria have

1802
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,599
fungi

1803
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,799
have the ability to invade the interior

1804
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,160
of the plant

1805
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:44,239
bring resources up the fungal hyphae are

1806
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,440
actually great places to see bacterial

1807
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:49,118
growth so

1808
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:52,639
there's this mycorrhizal just micro

1809
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,400
sphere if you would that microbes fungi

1810
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,000
bringing resources from the interior of

1811
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,160
the plant to the surface

1812
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,400
where bacteria can exploit them directly

1813
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,318
so you got bacteria on plants

1814
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,519
but you also have bacteria on fungi they

1815
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,838
got the nutrients

1816
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,599
from the plant so there are kind of

1817
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,838
several trophic levels that can happen

1818
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,838
here

1819
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,240
and then i'll just i'll read this with

1820
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,039
one more question that i'll

1821
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,358
um i'll read and then i think we'll sort

1822
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,720
of

1823
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:23,038
wrap up um so you you mentioned that

1824
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,719
most epiphytic epiphytes aggregate on

1825
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,000
the leaf surface

1826
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,399
and so what happens when a new

1827
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,639
population of pathogen lands there

1828
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,079
do they blend into the population

1829
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,318
navigate through it with

1830
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,839
nutrient competition or do they have to

1831
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:37,519
fight and

1832
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,599
sort of expel the local community to

1833
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,599
establish exclusive territory around the

1834
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,079
stomata

1835
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,519
that's a very good question um it's

1836
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,000
probably both of those things happening

1837
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:48,318
as you

1838
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,920
saw from the salmonella where it's it's

1839
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:52,880
less likely that an

1840
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,200
immigrant is going to survive at all if

1841
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,480
they land on a naked part of the leaf

1842
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,078
hey that part of the league probably

1843
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,199
doesn't have any resources for growth in

1844
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,160
the first place

1845
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,879
you don't have this you know

1846
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,038
modification of local environment

1847
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,480
but obviously if they're going to end up

1848
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,200
among other organisms they're going to

1849
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,760
have to be successful competitors so

1850
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,960
there will be this probably intense

1851
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,039
competition

1852
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,440
in many places where a pathogen would in

1853
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:20,319
fact land on a leaf if they didn't

1854
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,480
