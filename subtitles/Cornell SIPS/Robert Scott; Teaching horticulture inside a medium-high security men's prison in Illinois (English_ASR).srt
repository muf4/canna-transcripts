1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,809
I

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,940
want to show you a rare work at the

5
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:15,609
crossroads of criminal justice and

6
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:17,410
education these are two key

7
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:20,349
controversies in our society and their

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,539
intersection is not random we know that

9
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:24,519
people who end up caught in the criminal

10
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,160
justice system come from neighborhoods

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,989
with low quality schools

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,410
amongst many other things the experience

13
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:35,378
of incarceration tends to make tall

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,850
barriers to higher education even taller

15
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:38,320
meaning it's much less likely that

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,018
someone wind up in college if they end

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,469
up in prison first today I direct the

18
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:45,579
Cornell prison education program I

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,838
have something boastful to say here

20
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,429
about our program but i think it's not

21
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,378
necessary now that Don's giving that

22
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:51,488
lovely introduction the work i'll share

23
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:54,488
with you today is from the work i did

24
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:57,149
before cornell my project was an attempt

25
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:59,408
to do things in horticulture education

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,808
that were new new in prison in

27
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:04,408
particular possibly new an education

28
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:07,840
that we've known because of the

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,939
oddness of the environment of prison and

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,980
the constraints placed upon what is are

31
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:14,369
now the status quo things we expect from

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,100
a college classroom

33
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,500
so what's new about it is not so much

34
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:22,929
the style of horticulture education that

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,459
i was getting at or implementing or how

36
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,110
it was sort of somehow trying to do

37
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,199
something fundamentally different from

38
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:31,209
campus what is remarkable about the work

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,820
is how far i got in trying to make

40
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:36,549
things the same to how horticulture

41
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:39,579
could be taught at a good college campus

42
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,079
I see I'm as I'm looking out at you I

43
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,549
see several folks who participated in

44
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,019
the Cornell prison education program

45
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:45,939
welcome actually could we get a show of

46
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,679
hands quick from who you are so there's

47
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,450
there's several people here in this

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,880
section over here who've been involved

49
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,460
in this and so they will understand very

50
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,259
well and and some of them with no

51
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:57,579
background in horticulture the challenge

52
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,219
of this talk which is trying to both

53
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:01,929
introduce

54
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,179
things about prison I presume for most

55
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,640
folks in here you've never been to a

56
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,870
high-security prison in America and at

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,929
the same time talk about the challenge

58
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,670
of doing education and at within that

59
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,740
the field of horticulture in particular

60
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:16,389
and what we try to do to have meaningful

61
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,790
labs and activities for students in

62
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,619
prison

63
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,449
so I was trying to demonstrate that it

64
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,180
was possible to do good education in

65
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,560
prison in the field of horticulture and

66
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,060
I hope to share some of that with you

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,299
today they're going to be three sections

68
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,310
to this talk maybe I tell me if I talk

69
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:35,260
too fast i've been told i can go rather

70
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,359
quickly but I've got a lot i'm trying to

71
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:39,250
do it i just laid out i'll try to

72
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,959
introduce quickly higher education in

73
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,729
prison itself and i'll give you a quick

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,200
five minutes on the cornell prison

75
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,780
education program then i'll talk a

76
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,578
little bit about the challenges facing

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,979
horticulture education and really still

78
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:54,700
education in per se but but specifically

79
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,318
horticulture and then i'll talk about

80
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:58,438
some of the things I did to respond to

81
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,750
the challenges

82
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:04,328
so this five-minute second is actually

83
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,199
something I do on campus to introduce

84
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,060
the program when we're recruiting

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,408
faculty graduate students and

86
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,389
undergraduates who participate in our

87
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:11,759
program here a quick introduction to why

88
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,569
we would do college in prison

89
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,759
introducing the Cornell prison education

90
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,378
project itself and then the broader

91
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,818
context of correctional reform and what

92
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:21,340
we think the outcomes are when we put

93
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:24,039
post-secondary education in prisons so

94
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,719
education in prison is nothing new this

95
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,628
image on the left over here is actually

96
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,878
100 years old Auburn New York a prison

97
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:33,068
we work in today

98
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:35,408
classroom adults learning grade school

99
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:36,939
level curriculum that's the reason we

100
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,408
call them correctional centers in

101
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,568
American societies there's this image of

102
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:42,219
rehabilitation in prisons the idea is

103
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,929
that you don't just put people in a cell

104
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,009
and abandon them for 10 years and expect

105
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,989
something dramatically different to

106
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,810
happen you rehabilitate them you offer

107
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,579
them program do you educate folks here's

108
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,930
an image from the 70s at when the Pell

109
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,189
grants were made available for the first

110
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,019
time you had financial aid in the United

111
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:58,568
States college programs entered into the

112
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,819
prisons and there was a era in which

113
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:01,589
college programs flourished in American

114
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,388
prisons

115
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,280
speeding into the 80s and 90s America

116
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:10,299
was reeling from questions of what to do

117
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,068
about crime a lot of people its many of

118
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,930
us may be too young for this but if you

119
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,878
can remember the drumbeat of politics

120
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,129
back then was there's too much crime

121
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,288
this other politician hasn't been harsh

122
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,370
enough about crime this guy here thinks

123
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:23,228
people in prison should be taking

124
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,430
college classes I don't think so this

125
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,750
person here since you should only get

126
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,400
six months for this crime we're going to

127
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,560
give them 20 years and you see over a

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,779
couple of decades this trend towards

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,050
punitive pneus taking away programs from

130
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,638
people who've been convicted of crimes

131
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,900
specifically the crime bill of 1994 made

132
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,418
it illegal for people in prison to

133
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:42,859
receive Pell grants overnight we end up

134
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:45,549
with a lot of empty classrooms where

135
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,629
there used to be college classes

136
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,759
so the question then is really what do

137
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:51,228
we want to do when we when there's harm

138
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,729
in society when someone's convicted of a

139
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:54,978
crime we send them away to a prison what

140
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:57,288
do we what we want to have happen with

141
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,939
those individuals currently these are

142
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:00,228
the status quo here we have a lot of

143
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:01,250
exercise yards you've probably seen

144
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:03,349
these images if you read the New York

145
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,180
Times just kind of a drumbeat right now

146
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,949
of we aren't doing a lot of productive

147
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,650
stuff in there we might even be making

148
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,819
folks more dangerous making license

149
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,529
plates actually happens it over in

150
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,029
prison that's a photo from there and

151
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,379
this is a site that I saw actually down

152
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,899
the hall from where my classroom was in

153
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,098
Illinois where a gym is turned into a

154
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,899
bunk bed unit because of the

155
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:22,098
overcrowding of prisons because people

156
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,239
don't to spend money on this but they

157
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:25,098
don't have another answer right now

158
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,750
currently than just more and more

159
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:28,728
incarceration do you end up with that so

160
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,990
it doesn't even taking away exercise so

161
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,478
okay so now we've got folks that are

162
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,300
literally just in a sort of refugee kind

163
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,370
of situation this is an image from a

164
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,530
Cornell classroom happening at Auburn

165
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,329
prison we've got a pair of graduate

166
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,759
students at the front here aidan Lear's

167
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,948
and dance Anakin the year before both of

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,529
them pulled down professorships aidan's

169
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:52,970
at suny oswego and then how did Grinnell

170
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:54,918
teaching a literature seminar these are

171
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,310
students many in the room will recognize

172
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,329
from this section over here

173
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,399
having a conversation about literature

174
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:02,930
then these classes count in our

175
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,299
partnership with a community college

176
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,848
towards an associate degree Bob in the

177
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,590
room here in this photo along with Ron

178
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:11,300
Seaver as well as the president and

179
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,310
provost of cayuga community college who

180
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,918
work with Cornell in order to make an

181
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,449
associate's degree accessible to these

182
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,000
15 men who graduated on this particular

183
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,848
day in 2012 and in the middle we have a

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,699
philanthropist key theme of this work

185
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:27,408
without financial aid you basically have

186
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,598
no tuition revenue the folks that are in

187
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:32,689
America's prisons are of the lowest

188
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,839
economic strata so there's really no way

189
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,199
to fund college in prison let alone

190
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,909
combat the political that makes it so

191
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,009
difficult to do this without someone

192
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,080
providing private dollars and typically

193
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,389
not the students and here are the three

194
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,740
persons that Cornell operates in Auburn

195
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,419
Correctional Facility up in Auburn the

196
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,980
medium security prison-- down here in

197
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,960
Moravia very similar to the one I'll be

198
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,360
discussing the day in Illinois and a

199
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,629
maximum security prison in romulus

200
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,639
called Five Points correctional facility

201
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,560
very quick slide about outcomes this is

202
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,930
a an image of a couple of our former

203
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,399
students Sean who I presented at a

204
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,759
conference in nashville with last week

205
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,349
is now part time student at Columbia

206
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,300
John another one of our former students

207
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,710
is a carpenter in town and here is

208
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,240
actually participating in building

209
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,310
homeless shelters with an organization i

210
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,720
think in kamon county and some of our

211
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,610
undergraduates as they go out into the

212
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,170
world many of whom get involved in the

213
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,449
intersection between criminal justice

214
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,920
and the other fields they've studied in

215
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:28,199
wearing green chords and the graduation

216
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,210
ceremonies are undergrads wear green

217
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,800
cores to symbolize the the green prison

218
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:34,399
uniforms that our students on the inside

219
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,400
of the prison walls

220
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,319
they're good question done um there are

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,730
no prisons that have a mix of both

222
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,589
genders so so just to go back is it

223
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,560
there yeah these are all male prisons

224
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:54,659
and so yeah we could talk about that one

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,589
day so a lot of questions it raises for

226
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,590
folks Oh

227
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,589
ah

228
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:08,100
yes to Geneva the question was those are

229
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,569
a lot of women coming from Cornell and

230
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,490
to a prisoner the prison's male and

231
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:15,689
female are mixed and the answer was no

232
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,009
these are men's prisons and that that I

233
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,870
can kind of guess where that

234
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,469
conversation would go let's maybe wait

235
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,470
pull off on them

236
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:31,740
Willard okay so actually the woman on

237
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,659
the line here is sharing that right next

238
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,788
to Five Points correctional facility

239
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,860
right over here there's a drug treatment

240
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:39,509
and rehabilitation center which actually

241
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,918
is one of the main alternatives I kind

242
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,559
of count that as a non prison in a way

243
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,870
it's a it's a confinement facility but

244
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,549
it's intended to be a short stay and

245
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,639
release where you're being treated for

246
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:52,639
drug treatment and it is a

247
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,639
co-educational

248
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,570
thank you

249
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,919
okay I'm trying to zoom ahead here so

250
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,440
let's talk a little bit about this

251
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,500
product I hadn't Illinois and the

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,300
challenges faced by a person who wants

253
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,039
to just bring a solid horticultural

254
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,179
education into the place folks who want

255
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,559
to do something positive with their

256
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,199
lives have a chance to do something

257
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,029
better why am I going back to the

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,009
challenges after having just spoken

259
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:19,669
about the denial of financial aid and so

260
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:22,049
on because there are many other issues

261
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:24,089
both broad and specific to this

262
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:26,459
presentation which undergird the work

263
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,750
and present tremendous conflicts the

264
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,540
broader problem is that we have 2.3

265
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,740
million people in prison about 6.7

266
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,799
million people under correctional

267
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,930
supervision that's parole and over 70

268
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,939
million people currently alive with

269
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:40,939
criminal records as we think about these

270
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,560
the challenges to employing and

271
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,750
generating you know gainful positive

272
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,639
futures for our society out of that

273
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,679
negative resume that all those folks are

274
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,350
carrying with them that's what we're

275
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,549
trying to combat here as an institution

276
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,259
of higher learning we're in a position

277
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,819
to offer education right so that's what

278
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,340
is a university do in prison probably

279
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,960
educate but generally the population we

280
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,009
find in prison lacks access to good

281
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,269
education they haven't had a good

282
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:06,509
background they don't come from the best

283
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,829
high schools they aren't web designers

284
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:09,149
already they aren't coming with all the

285
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,009
skills that a lot of our students would

286
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,889
come from

287
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,689
they come from communities with

288
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:18,059
inconsistent

289
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,460
institutions inconsistent mother tongue

290
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,659
languages and there's no ladder in front

291
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,220
of them good high school to a good

292
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,870
two-year college to a good four-year

293
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,250
college and so that's usually the path

294
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,470
that we try to construct on the inside

295
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,259
in this case in Illinois I was really

296
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,970
trying to defy the odds I might have to

297
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,769
fly through some of this but the main

298
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,139
thing the folks have been in prison

299
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:39,088
before you might chime in in the QA

300
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,028
to work within the system to change it

301
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,179
is tremendously difficult any campus

302
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:46,379
educator who doesn't know the

303
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:48,688
constructional environment what might be

304
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,339
surprised to learn that now generally

305
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:52,919
there's no one on one conversations

306
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,109
there's no internet there is no email

307
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,849
there are no office hours there will be

308
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:59,009
no phone calls or notes with your

309
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,350
students there's barely any library

310
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,879
resources of an academic type you can't

311
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,470
just name drop in your class because

312
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,509
your students can go to Wikipedia and

313
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,999
look up the name of that person that you

314
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:11,220
were referencing now common items are

315
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:13,649
considered potential weapons or

316
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,410
contraband including scissors large

317
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,089
paper clips DVDs chewing gum sugar

318
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:22,108
packets anything made of metal or glass

319
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,279
etc you can imagine now that why I'm

320
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:24,899
saying a majority of what I'm trying to

321
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,698
do is just do a normal education in

322
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,798
prison because what you see a lot of

323
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,748
times when you go into prison is these

324
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:32,730
kind of aberrations of reality why are

325
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:34,079
we doing it this way it's because these

326
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,970
rules have made it impossible to do it

327
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,988
in the regular way to put it in

328
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,489
perspective many of the things I

329
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:41,069
accomplish in the Illinois prison system

330
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,629
thus far have been impossible for us to

331
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,519
accomplish here in upstate New York with

332
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:46,438
the Cornell prison education program a

333
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,139
lot of that derives from the fact that

334
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:51,088
the program i did in Illinois I had made

335
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,889
this decision to try to work inside the

336
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,779
system i infiltrated the system as

337
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,698
opposed to Cornell's which is from

338
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:57,720
without

339
00:11:55,698 --> 00:12:00,479
so just to give you an image of this

340
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,489
teachers generally I presume in my

341
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
colleagues throughout the world don't

342
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,910
have the experience of calling a

343
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,980
watchtower on a walkie-talkie to tell

344
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:11,759
them that they're moving 11 inmates to a

345
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,889
garden with shovels I had a

346
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,418
walkie-talkie I had keys and I had to

347
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,850
secure every single tool when they

348
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:19,798
weren't in use on the other hand I was

349
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,928
the only person in the facility during

350
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:26,159
day shift with a PhD I attains the

351
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:28,230
Appalachian dock folks who knew me as

352
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,548
the one person around was highly

353
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,589
educated and trying to create an

354
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,149
intellectual culture there and I was

355
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:36,329
really trying to understand the

356
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,428
structural challenges that that were

357
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:40,469
surmountable to make it possible to have

358
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:42,358
a real rehabilitative educational

359
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,069
program there so those are the

360
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:46,949
challenges facing horticulture in prison

361
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:49,799
I will do them quickly the anti

362
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:52,479
rehabilitation culture of the prison

363
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,299
competition from other units in the

364
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,519
facility and then inmate cynicism and so

365
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,620
if you think about it this is really the

366
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,600
overall anti a rehabilitation and the

367
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,209
sort of inside of the components of the

368
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,649
prison and then person by person

369
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:07,778
challenges there's a lot of challenges

370
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,850
so after the denial of Pell Grant so we

371
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:12,458
might be feeling this this week in our

372
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,249
country a lot of ways a change in policy

373
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,528
or a change in

374
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:19,778
political era will come with a feeling

375
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:21,308
of mandate and so correctional staff are

376
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:23,438
in bold in the feel like it was all

377
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:26,469
right to oppose all forms of Corrections

378
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:27,818
in the 90s um not just formally because

379
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,550
there aren't Pell grants but also

380
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:31,958
informally to say dr. Owens is here I

381
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,128
don't see why he has to come in here I

382
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,659
don't see his name on the list I'm not

383
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:36,209
gonna let him in today and just and just

384
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:38,558
this kind of micro

385
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,479
resistance to education barriers were

386
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:41,679
set up everywhere we lost the keys to

387
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,420
that classroom we're not using it today

388
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,878
this type of thing and this persists to

389
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:47,438
this day there was rampant racist and

390
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,089
sexist statements in my experience of

391
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:50,558
working at this prison on a daily basis

392
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,620
and this is something I think even our

393
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:56,620
folks at work at from the program at

394
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,808
Cornell don't hear as much that the

395
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,299
gender binary of the systems really

396
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:03,009
makes a very very macho environment in

397
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,299
these places that's why i Don's question

398
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,039
is really right on what's what happens

399
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:08,558
when you send women and it really

400
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,480
permeated the day-to-day experience of

401
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:12,458
the facility I'm going to talk about the

402
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
this in a little bit more detail so I

403
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,518
actually kept the log of all the stuff

404
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,989
because I this was upsetting it was

405
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,220
traumatizing to me I was hearing my

406
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,139
students described in a way I didn't

407
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,120
like right and people opposing my

408
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,129
mission so this is my therapy I actually

409
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,899
would just say today someone called one

410
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,730
of my students a dog today someone

411
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,470
called one of my students a you

412
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,750
know these visas these kind of racially

413
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,259
loaded words and i worked with this

414
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,568
author james Lowen

415
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,739
who is at american university in DC he's

416
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:38,969
a historian he wrote this book called

417
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:41,249
son downtown's he would grow up in

418
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,540
Decatur Illinois I mean so he remembers

419
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:43,678
there were these towns called son

420
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,828
downtown's Ivan if you've heard about

421
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:48,778
them the quick thing is towns in the

422
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:50,578
early 20th century in Illinois would

423
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:53,068
have put signs on the border of the town

424
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,228
who say things like whites only within

425
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:56,759
city limits after dark or the more

426
00:14:55,229 --> 00:15:00,660
common one and a slightly more vulgar

427
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,979
one if the Sun Goes Down and you your

428
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,149
ass is brow and you better get out of

429
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:04,829
town or a lot of times there's a dark

430
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,298
colored donkey you know just running and

431
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:08,428
I was the image and this was a way of

432
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:10,019
announcing that these towns didn't let

433
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:12,119
black people live there you could work

434
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,519
there but when the Sun went down you had

435
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,798
to be out of town

436
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,578
so why are we bringing this up I worked

437
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:18,808
in a place where there are a lot of

438
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:21,208
sundown towns in the past now there's

439
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:22,469
prison towns let's look at carterville

440
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,328
real quicks is up from some of my

441
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,819
research this is actually a place where

442
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:29,159
I had to go for my training it was a son

443
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:30,599
downtown in the old days wore black

444
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,618
folks go if they could work in

445
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,449
Carterville in the old days but they

446
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:34,949
couldn't actually live there this little

447
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:36,208
town called cope up here this is all

448
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:40,128
documented in that book I just

449
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:42,928
referenced City Council statements

450
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:44,548
real estate records and so on and so

451
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:46,619
when I went to carterville for my

452
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:47,909
training I just check this out because I

453
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,959
was curious I'd already been working in

454
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:52,499
the department of corrections I was like

455
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,538
what's going on here and so I went to

456
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:55,709
cope i went to carterville and i went to

457
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,239
john logan College which is where

458
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,818
they're now it's now the training center

459
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:01,288
for Southern Illinois for the Department

460
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:02,969
of Corrections I don't think most people

461
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:04,828
would know the John Logan if you go back

462
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,119
in time was the guy basically made his

463
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:08,128
political career on what's called the

464
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:10,528
Negro exclusion eggs and quotes like

465
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:11,970
this language anymore but his career was

466
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,379
started in trying to exclude black folks

467
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,788
from Illinois has really Illinois Smoove

468
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,798
we remember it today is the land of

469
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:18,298
lincoln so I know this is my colleagues

470
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:19,168
in Illinois sayings it done before and

471
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:21,298
this is some of this stuff you know

472
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:22,438
people want to hear this today but this

473
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:24,149
is empirical this is this actually

474
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:26,548
occurred and i want to say specifically

475
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,889
here I went to cope because I was

476
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:30,509
driving from northern area here it's not

477
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,209
an all white sorry is not an all-black

478
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,869
settlement and

479
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,758
carterville is not an all white

480
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,499
settlement today it really is not the

481
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,269
Sun downtown system so don't misconstrue

482
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:41,009
what I'm trying to say here we no longer

483
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,259
live in the system cope is basically we

484
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:45,250
call it like a trailer settlement a lot

485
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,870
of low income my folks there when i went

486
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,190
to john logan College a lot of black

487
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,330
folks were going to college there so

488
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,730
we're really not in that system anymore

489
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,730
but that was a legacy where are we at

490
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,200
today this is the 1952 map of where the

491
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,450
Sun downtown's were in southern Illinois

492
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,940
and so cities that are denoted by all

493
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,649
caps and bold where the known sundown

494
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,179
towns of this region you see I've got

495
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,410
carterville on the red block there

496
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,319
that's the prison I was working in and

497
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,730
it extends up to Northern Illinois a lot

498
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,938
of people know about Cicero and certain

499
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,049
cities of her famous for this up north

500
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,269
today this is where we have prisons in

501
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,919
jails in southern Illinois and so these

502
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,349
are basically prison towns jail domes

503
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,308
and so you know we could say to

504
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,659
ourselves well maybe we've just

505
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,160
completely got rid of racism in the

506
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,069
sixties all went away there's nothing of

507
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,209
nothing correlating between these two

508
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:29,799
whatsoever it just happens to be a

509
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,610
comparable number about 50 to sundown

510
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,200
towns in about 60 46 jail towns

511
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:36,959
this is the thing that really drives the

512
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,100
field in a lot of ways this is a

513
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,910
charter this will be hopefully out in an

514
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:44,649
article next year in american studies of

515
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,900
the incarceration rate in the state of

516
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,640
illinois and so you can see if we're go

517
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,769
back to 52 we've got around 8,000 people

518
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,080
in jails and prisons in illinois and

519
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:55,299
about a sick and these pie charts down

520
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,129
here carry along they don't always

521
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:59,349
report demographic data for various

522
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,300
reasons in the correction system but

523
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:04,659
about sixty percent white back then and

524
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:05,859
about less than a quarter in 1999 the

525
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,179
last time i had data and so this is

526
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,619
basically up to the time of the work I

527
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,660
was doing now the other thing I want to

528
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:12,399
point out here is the line the dashed

529
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,460
line is just counting facilities

530
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,590
according to this numeration here so the

531
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,880
best time in a certain sense to be in

532
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:20,230
prison in Illinois would have been here

533
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,120
because the number was the lowest about

534
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,230
6,000 people in jail you had 11

535
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:27,399
facilities that means people are the

536
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,529
most space the most the highest inmate

537
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,110
to staff ratio if they were involved in

538
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:33,609
programs and and then when you see them

539
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:35,199
starting to close prisons here while the

540
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:39,969
number keeps going up we're both 50,000

541
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,970
right now that's the overcrowding so

542
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,750
anti rehabilitation culture of the

543
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,240
prisoners very true this just made the

544
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,880
whole project all the more loaded

545
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,079
because not only are you trying to say

546
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,610
hey could you help this student get from

547
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,409
the housing unit over the classroom this

548
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:55,990
person's later whatever but you've got

549
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,670
this constant drumbeat of these folks

550
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,400
are really not worthy of things not

551
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,990
always in explicit racial terms but a

552
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,780
lot of times in terms of just because

553
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,740
they're considered criminals or inmates

554
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:08,019
they just don't deserve an education

555
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,630
that's just the mood of the police

556
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:12,819
alright competition from other prison

557
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,530
functions so here's how the prison works

558
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:18,039
this is an actual prison it's a google

559
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:19,809
map the orange house units X houses as

560
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,700
we call them had 400 people each of them

561
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,990
a once missing left wing it's solitary

562
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,940
confinement unit over there was cut off

563
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,339
that there's a school in gym that's

564
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,500
where my classroom was perimeter fence

565
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:31,449
keeps everyone in and then this extra

566
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,299
fence there blocks off the exercise yard

567
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,799
and in the purple room there you have

568
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,419
some folks making cardboard boxes in

569
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,069
prison uniforms every prison usually has

570
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,620
some industry where they try to produce

571
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:44,169
something about 20 inmates had access to

572
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:46,539
that out of about 1,600 1,600 inmates at

573
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:49,150
this facility ok but so here's the thing

574
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,309
the prison administration and security

575
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,740
personnel in general preferred to

576
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,720
limitanei moving all together unless it

577
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,279
was completely necessary so just to get

578
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,390
a student from the school building to

579
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,759
the garden which we'll talk about in a

580
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:04,030
second was a tremendous act of acting

581
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,379
asking for permission and you can this

582
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:09,430
is how they like it so here's an ex

583
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,070
house in Illinois the grass has been

584
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,080
pretty poorly treated they know no one's

585
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,309
moving there's no trees there's no

586
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,960
people this is just a completely

587
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,069
controlled environment you can see if if

588
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,720
people didn't want to send folks after

589
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,450
the exercise yard you could just say

590
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,130
exercise in here today

591
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,480
so when I was in this area I had to

592
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,270
watch towers on the other side of the

593
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,860
garden and so there was always this kind

594
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,779
of constant surveillance of things and

595
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,949
so and you can imagine then if you've

596
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:35,470
got a party that's in the watchtower

597
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,690
it's kind of looking to stop education

598
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,019
they basically had a kind of constant

599
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,640
micro managerial kind of thing they were

600
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,500
doing of saying I think I saw someone do

601
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,940
something wrong there uh so they can get

602
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,099
on a loudspeaker from a from a

603
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,509
watchtower and say inmate so-and-so come

604
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,699
over here or you need to go back to the

605
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:53,829
classroom or whatever so this is these

606
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,450
for the resistances zooming in a little

607
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:57,909
bit more you can see here's the school's

608
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,620
I'd have to walk out here to do this and

609
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,730
you can see there's a greenhouse so this

610
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,288
is actually I mean the main thing years

611
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,419
this should be an environment of a huge

612
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:09,069
opportunity that's a 0.9 one acre garden

613
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,049
space that's been pre-established at the

614
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:13,210
prison and a greenhouse here's the thing

615
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:14,250
there was this grounds crew at the

616
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,630
prison

617
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,000
which yeah I'm going to break the seal

618
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,410
and say the prison was corrupt and stool

619
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,819
pigeons got to be in the grounds crew

620
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,890
and so the grounds crew got the green

621
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:25,658
house and the garden before I

622
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,150
established this sort of funding

623
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,370
apparatus by which we could have a

624
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,919
horticulture program and I had to work

625
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:34,599
really hard politically to get access to

626
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,120
this greenhouse for my students and I

627
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,279
could not get access to the greenhouse

628
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,899
so that was the place that basically a

629
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,490
collection of ten inmates on this

630
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,169
grounds crew which would do lawn mowing

631
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,779
including lawn mowing outside of the

632
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,950
fence driving tractors around raking

633
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,808
leaves to the extent that retrieves

634
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,548
getting ice off the sidewalks they could

635
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,319
hang out in a greenhouse in the cold

636
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:55,240
winter when all the housing units were

637
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,308
fairly cold and most people didn't have

638
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,720
any space because we're stuck in a small

639
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,769
cell they could be in a greenhouse

640
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,329
growing poinsettias for the

641
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:02,650
administrator's office and so they

642
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:05,288
didn't they never in the two and a half

643
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,750
years I was in this program let our

644
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:08,890
program use greenhouse this is really

645
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,529
problematic this is actually the only

646
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,330
photo I have of myself in the classroom

647
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,649
and so this is actually the classroom in

648
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:17,019
the school building you can see these

649
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,179
tall sort of warehouse like walls no

650
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:21,099
windows

651
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,048
at me I'm in a green hoodie here hit no

652
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:24,819
idea camera person was coming um you can

653
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:26,230
see some of the students here you can

654
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:29,829
also see there's some folks on computers

655
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,000
back there and yeah so imagine after the

656
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:32,918
first frost when the garden is

657
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,589
effectively not useful any longer in

658
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,470
terms of doing new projects waterlogged

659
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,519
etc that you know the grounds cruel

660
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,880
control of the greenhouse is

661
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,210
particularly frustrating and

662
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,130
talk more about that so the inmate

663
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,240
cynicism about vocational you so finally

664
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,100
then you have this question of how do

665
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,690
you find good students in here I'm try

666
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,069
to do this quick this is actually the

667
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,059
only thing that the state of Illinois

668
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,559
does in terms of post-secondary

669
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,480
education opportunities when

670
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,279
universities and colleges don't have

671
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,170
proactive campaigns like Cornell's and

672
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,690
the University of Illinois program

673
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,789
that's where I came from

674
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,590
so here's Danville it's got three types

675
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,139
of courses that are offered automated

676
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,909
technology horticulture and career

677
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,280
technology what are those three things

678
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,990
the

679
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,319
automotive

680
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,789
quickly got automotive tech that was um

681
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:24,629
doing custom paint jobs on correctional

682
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:26,789
officers cars and trucks for free or for

683
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,700
the cost of the paint souping up their

684
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:32,549
engines I remember people detailing

685
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,830
carburetors and putting like insignias

686
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:37,200
and American flags on the different

687
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:39,000
parts of the cars and stuff and that was

688
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,500
that and then career tech was a six week

689
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,529
class and what you learned how to turn

690
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,779
on a computer and use Microsoft Word so

691
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:47,129
that's that's the status quo and to

692
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:49,619
which what you're about to see me trying

693
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,830
to do comes in a brief comment on jobs

694
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:54,149
everyone always wants to

695
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,549
exclamation of this it's just one paper

696
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:59,009
of chart

697
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:00,809
from 2012 study comfortable time in

698
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,400
Indiana right next door to where we were

699
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,019
at in terms of what kind of job outcomes

700
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,350
in a group of five thousand or more

701
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,180
folks had over five years sequence and

702
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:12,000
these red blob boxes are just trying to

703
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,680
show any overlap with in the way this

704
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,880
paper defined it the categories of

705
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,009
post-secondary education that are

706
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,820
offered in the prison it doesn't even

707
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:21,500
get into what are the cells just put

708
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,759
asterisks

709
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,410
academic programs have a much wider

710
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,470
range of outcomes I was just talking

711
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,029
with Tommy ervell one of our folks those

712
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,730
in our program the one of Columbia is

713
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:34,349
now an uber driver another who's now at

714
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,680
Lehman College is a registered nurse

715
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:39,990
another who's going to

716
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:43,560
that school of business in baruch

717
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,240
college is a paralegal John's a

718
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,950
carpenter so carpentry so there are so

719
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,029
there's some overlap but our that's the

720
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,710
whole point of having a liberal arts

721
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,599
education is we think that this liberal

722
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,519
arts education will lead you to a proper

723
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,959
consideration of having a examined life

724
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,019
finally good time is a hundred-year-old

725
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,039
concept that

726
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,808
going really fast that's what I said I

727
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,399
wouldn't do check it out there's an old

728
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:08,319
idea in prison which is you got a bunch

729
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,309
of people there in prison they did

730
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,599
something bad they're gonna get released

731
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,889
one day a lot of them are gonna come

732
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,599
back to prison for doing another bad

733
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,640
thing what if you could take some of

734
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,049
them figure out some activity to give

735
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,580
them that would guarantee that when they

736
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,750
go out there productive and they become

737
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:22,089
taxpayers and they don't come back

738
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,039
that'd be really valuable to the state

739
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:26,079
right so you could take that activity

740
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,700
and actually credit them and give them

741
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,379
time off their sentence you could

742
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,620
incentivize them to become these good

743
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,630
people so that's called good time

744
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:38,709
so a hundred years on that has become

745
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,890
the most pinata concept it is so

746
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,420
bureaucratized and and barrier ridden

747
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,730
that it's almost impossible to implement

748
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,840
this in a good way if nothing else I'm

749
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,670
highlighting here that the very

750
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,678
definition of it in Illinois said that

751
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,929
people who had violent offenses sex

752
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,700
offenses or anything involving a weapon

753
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:55,870
so even if I go into a store and no one

754
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,230
gets hurt but I said I have a knife on

755
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:00,789
me you're never getting good time

756
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,170
crazy review I won't even explain this

757
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:04,808
to you but basically the time it takes

758
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,340
to get a few months off your sentence it

759
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:08,500
starts all the way in the courthouse

760
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,970
before you're in prison and extends all

761
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,859
the way to the day of your release and

762
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,600
there's six different layers of review

763
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:15,009
you basically would spend more time

764
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,740
doing the getting the good time than

765
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:19,269
getting off of your sentence by now here

766
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,160
the actual people that got good time

767
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:23,349
from my program at about 120 people over

768
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,450
those two years take classes with me 14

769
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:28,269
students were eligible at all everyone

770
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,580
who's eligible tries to do it and they

771
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,900
fill out contracts typically I've got

772
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:35,379
about three out of it if they were to

773
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:38,170
take all my courses so days are credited

774
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,940
towards release from prison and then the

775
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,860
rule in Illinois as you get half of that

776
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,970
number of days off of your sentence so

777
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:45,219
you can actually calculate out the

778
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,380
number of days or in this case I did it

779
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,279
by years of

780
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,070
sentence reduction that my course

781
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,808
generated multiply that by the cost per

782
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:55,439
person in prison and there's a cost

783
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:57,538
savings to the state of about 35

784
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,548
a thousand dollars I just want to point

785
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,109
this out

786
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:03,298
these ones with parentheses these are

787
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:05,099
folks that didn't get the credit in the

788
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,048
end their contract was voided because

789
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,878
again they did you know inmate was out

790
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:11,220
of place got written up throughout their

791
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:12,658
good time or whatever had had a pen that

792
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,250
was unauthorized throughout the good

793
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,120
time so there would have been actually

794
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,319
much more but in eligibility and

795
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,258
that that kind of constant rule

796
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,689
micromanagement interviewed with this

797
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:26,399
finally this is the real point

798
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,019
people then become hugely cynical about

799
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,678
this so some of these these are my worst

800
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,419
students because these are the folks

801
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,740
that were basically like okay I'm stuck

802
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,750
at Danville I've got another three years

803
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,159
in prison what do we got here automotive

804
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,259
tech I don't want to go detail some

805
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,610
officers car career-tech well that's

806
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,870
only six weeks so I'm only getting like

807
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,069
just turn on a computer and get out of

808
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,719
there only thing you can get a couple

809
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,579
weeks off your sentence anyway there's

810
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,048
this doc scott guy and he's like making

811
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:50,819
everyone got to a garden okay I'll try

812
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:52,859
that and they would be the students that

813
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:54,898
would be there saying if I get out of my

814
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,569
chair will I lose good time if I get a

815
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:59,339
c-minus can i still have a good time if

816
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:01,230
I don't come to class tomorrow because I

817
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,759
feel sick am I going to get good time we

818
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,139
credit the day for a good time if I

819
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,028
leave early today because I have a virus

820
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:07,849
and so that was just the constant

821
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:10,349
conversation and so this actually

822
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,449
is just another barrier so it's just an

823
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:15,589
example of a on the individual level

824
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,720
bear here to this stuff okay

825
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:21,148
is what we want to hear responses to the

826
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,440
challenges I need to underscore how rare

827
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:25,199
and unheard of this work is you will

828
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,298
hear me now reference a garden with

829
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,940
hundreds of species of plants a library

830
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:30,859
with thousands of titles on itself

831
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,509
computers in the classroom

832
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:34,949
students participating in the

833
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,079
construction of meaningful projects

834
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,569
aimed at helping their fellow men this

835
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,038
is really against the odds and the

836
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:43,138
infighting environment of prison and

837
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,490
against considerable resistance of

838
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,459
course said there's not many times i'll

839
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,870
spare you

840
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,279
here's the three parts of this are two

841
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:51,500
parts of this sections can be quick so

842
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,480
we can have some QA this is

843
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,460
fundamentally everything this education

844
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,559
work is about is trying to respond to

845
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,539
this contentious environment and really

846
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,919
hopefully particularly this week

847
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,210
creating an environment where people can

848
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,370
really have a discussion with each other

849
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:06,079
and try to understand each other and try

850
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,809
to move forward into a fruitful future

851
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,519
together and then I'll talk a little bit

852
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,269
about some of the specific things that I

853
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,349
did there's a classroom my top guys in

854
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:16,970
2013 for the University of Illinois and

855
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:19,849
my other hat which is an educational

856
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,350
researcher and I just want to point out

857
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:23,929
like look at the mood in this room so

858
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:25,490
it's an all-male facility right these

859
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,830
guys are not in a mode of being

860
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,420
dangerous

861
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:31,039
psychopathic leave any little micro

862
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,720
thing they do is going to be a trouble

863
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,819
these this is a community that formed

864
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,350
around our program you can see part of

865
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:37,759
the library here's the library's spread

866
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:39,949
over three rooms the way that we did it

867
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,710
we get to sit at seminar tables we're

868
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,700
reading research articles and I know all

869
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,230
these people this is the main difference

870
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,000
between folks that do this work

871
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,650
firsthand like some of the folks here in

872
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,579
the room and folks that talk about this

873
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,180
and write about it but have never

874
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:55,129
visited I know that Johnny page is in

875
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,230
governor State University today Michael

876
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,510
Braun guy from New Jersey like me

877
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,950
cavanon Elam is about to publish an

878
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:02,480
article in Harvard educational review

879
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,400
came out of some of this educational

880
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,019
work we did there the prison's trying to

881
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,330
block him from publishing it it's on a

882
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:10,700
really dangerous topic of how education

883
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,799
for prisoners could enhance democracy by

884
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,930
having people have informed voices so

885
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,119
Harvard likes it administration not so

886
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,860
much

887
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,809
this guy's a person who's now a teacher

888
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:23,389
in a Catholic school and morelia in

889
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,069
Mexico he was deported even though he

890
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,970
was

891
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:27,829
brought to us when he was one year old

892
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,740
sentence without evidence at the age of

893
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:33,769
15 he did 15 years and the person who's

894
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,799
my age and has now been moving living in

895
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:37,700
Mexico where he'd never lived before and

896
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,649
and he's a Catholic school teacher and

897
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,509
is a wife of the friend of mine she said

898
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,710
working like college so these are all

899
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,879
people with names to me they're all

900
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,400
people that are actually doing things

901
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,110
that are good and that's that's the

902
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,370
thing to remember through all this let's

903
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,269
get into what i was doing here this is

904
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,589
actually i didn't know they were going

905
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:53,059
to take this photo either it was the day

906
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,379
of my job interview where they said look

907
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,210
we till it up the land for you check

908
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,900
this out and i talked to a bunch of

909
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,269
people who know nothing about

910
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,280
horticulture who hired me to do this all

911
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,539
right and I provided the funding for

912
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,680
myself so you know back to the

913
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:05,299
fundamental challenge of having no

914
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,090
tuition money now we're looking at a

915
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:09,500
USGS soil survey for the site here's

916
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,089
where the garden would be the

917
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,829
interesting thing here is that you can

918
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:14,779
toy folks to be familiar with it so

919
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,939
you're looking at a Caitlyn series but

920
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,250
the Midwest soils are typically mala

921
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,390
cells and alpha cells

922
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,099
the garden was in a particularly boggy

923
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,290
area this is one of the things that made

924
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,609
this land not too valuable to the

925
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,440
Mennonites who are actually who sold it

926
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:29,299
to the state in the early 80s and made

927
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,410
it into a prison so it turns out the

928
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,619
garden is right in the spot that made

929
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,570
the site completely invaluable as a

930
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:37,699
place to do agriculture I surrounded by

931
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:39,769
corn and soybean fields oh and also just

932
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,180
no here's the Indiana border so I was

933
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:42,529
comparing to Indiana for you basically

934
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,009
and you're you're in a Cell on that side

935
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:47,470
of building here i'm looking at indiana

936
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:50,809
all rights get in here

937
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:54,140
so we made maps of this stuff this is

938
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:57,019
this is by itself a huge feet imagine an

939
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,580
environment in which a string that's

940
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:59,690
this long is considered contraband

941
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:01,339
because you could put it around

942
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,720
someone's it's never happened in this

943
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:05,089
prison but that's the type of thing they

944
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,490
say in the kind of constant looking for

945
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,649
criminality mindset that runs the place

946
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:12,170
so let alone a tape measure which is

947
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,700
metal which even worse so we actually

948
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,130
had to manufacture the tools to do this

949
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,690
and I would send supplement what we were

950
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,880
doing with satellite photos as you can

951
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,019
see to try to produce

952
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,730
sufficient drawings to show what we're

953
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,129
trying to do the red lines in this case

954
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,120
are digging little channels to drain the

955
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,280
things so they wouldn't allow us to

956
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,529
install culverts because you can hide

957
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,730
weapons and culverts so so we had to do

958
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,930
this type of thing you can see I'm just

959
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,950
trying to get the water to go in one

960
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:38,450
direction away from here and right away

961
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:41,090
tremendous food waste going on in prison

962
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,440
so the goal in New in Illinois is to

963
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:45,049
feed people on one dollar per day or

964
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,930
less the result is very low quality food

965
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:49,970
and the result is inmates going to the

966
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,890
cafeteria getting their food presented

967
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,319
to them eating the cookie and the rest

968
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,420
gets tossed so we very quickly got into

969
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,769
this composting work an image of what

970
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,570
we're trying to do the first year that

971
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,920
of course this is a final crown sighs we

972
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:03,039
didn't get any access to bring in full

973
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,380
size trees so we bought bare root

974
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,418
seedling trees and grafted trees in

975
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,440
order to start implementing this it's

976
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,849
just an image of what it looks like the

977
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,989
first year shouldn't be much information

978
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:12,979
here but you can see the stakes are

979
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:15,169
where we're putting the trees and

980
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:17,808
mulching it with grass clippings and

981
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:19,519
leaves and fresh compost we've made here

982
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:22,489
to be where we got by May so you can see

983
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,440
then a lot is is food so for another day

984
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:25,608
the whole thing of bringing nutritious

985
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,038
food into a place with the cafeteria

986
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:30,078
dynamics like I described is going to

987
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:32,328
have its own excitations and conflicts

988
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:33,798
latent into it now and we start getting

989
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:35,808
into this drought period this is

990
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:37,219
actually kind of devastating so there

991
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:38,058
was a drought right around a lockdown so

992
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:39,588
we couldn't go out there and water

993
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,028
plants they wouldn't let inmate movement

994
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:42,318
back to that and so this is where you

995
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:44,269
start getting triangulated by all these

996
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:45,469
constraints it must have rained one day

997
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,759
and someone took a photo it's the only

998
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:48,469
photo I have looking that way that ever

999
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,058
was taken so this is that building where

1000
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:52,338
they make cardboard boxes the greenhouse

1001
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:56,259
here and you can see we're starting to

1002
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:58,940
put compost piles out here and when the

1003
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:00,409
lockdown continued that you're in the

1004
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,028
drought continued you can see the yellow

1005
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:05,269
beds represent beds that basically

1006
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:07,368
tanked when it got too dry the irony of

1007
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:08,469
our waterlogged soil having been trained

1008
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:10,878
properly

1009
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:12,138
we had to find some other activities so

1010
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:13,699
I've worked at the construction class

1011
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,378
when they wouldn't let our students move

1012
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,588
they actually produce proper compost

1013
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,588
bins

1014
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,668
and we get a

1015
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:23,838
sort of rebounding of the garden when

1016
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,398
they let us back out there and September

1017
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,949
then it's a frost so again now you got

1018
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:31,009
to imagine I've got a good six months or

1019
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:33,318
more you know usda zone 5 so by seven

1020
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:34,219
months in which it's not reasonable to

1021
00:34:33,318 --> 00:34:37,099
think that you're going to have much

1022
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,230
productivity if you plant plants so what

1023
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:40,940
do we do

1024
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,369
we start dividing up the garden beds and

1025
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,690
offering the men opportunities to kind

1026
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,220
of compete with each other to do better

1027
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,659
designs for the different sections of

1028
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:49,058
the garden we had competitions for the

1029
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,108
spaces that were common

1030
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:53,450
weird things like this showed up on the

1031
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:55,398
computer this was made with ms paint i

1032
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,469
think and cut and paste i actually don't

1033
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:58,788
know how mr. Stilson did this this won

1034
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,500
the competition not because it's

1035
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:02,630
reasonable because this looks like water

1036
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,099
to me and i don't know what that would

1037
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,289
do for the flower and crab apple or

1038
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:07,338
whatever that is i think i'm not even

1039
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,750
sure what species he thought we were

1040
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,940
gonna plant here and when this is pretty

1041
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,548
two-dimensional but um the idea was we

1042
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,139
want a picnic table a table and to try

1043
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:16,400
putting some elevation to one of the

1044
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:18,049
trees so that because people like

1045
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,490
sitting on these little Stoops

1046
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,960
and that then made it into the design

1047
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:22,569
right so we actually you know started

1048
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
kind of doing this type of thing

1049
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,059
we ended up with river birch as the

1050
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,990
species we were trying for there and you

1051
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:30,019
can kind of see as we're going along

1052
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:32,179
hear that a lot was developing in 2013 I

1053
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:33,679
should say for another day there was a

1054
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:34,909
whole project of Illinois at sporting me

1055
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,349
across the state to implement our

1056
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:38,329
composting system i'm not i'm going to

1057
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:41,480
tell you about that but the composting

1058
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:43,730
thing was huge because of the tens of

1059
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,019
thousands of dollars of waste expenses

1060
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,059
that the facility incurred and this

1061
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:49,190
being a way to process things back into

1062
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:50,420
the site we started using the

1063
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,240
construction classroom which is

1064
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,280
abandoned to produce cement papers by

1065
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,709
hand and to teach the dynamics of

1066
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,120
construction and portland cement and

1067
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,619
angry and all that stuff and get these

1068
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,819
things out here so you could walk

1069
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,170
through the Prairie you can see this was

1070
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,630
supposed to be getting designed as a

1071
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,789
Japanese garden we had a lot of ideas

1072
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,180
and cornell university offered me a job

1073
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:13,820
so that's where we stopped i want to say

1074
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:15,199
i needed to get out of there just you've

1075
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,240
heard me i'm coming i'm giving you

1076
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,210
actually a fairly sanitized version of

1077
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,099
this this was

1078
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,230
grading psychological work for me i was

1079
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:27,710
working every weekend i was constantly

1080
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,300
bringing in books pdfs trying to get

1081
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,849
clearance through a bunch of people that

1082
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,590
didn't want me to do this

1083
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:34,519
so i don't recommend anyone do this I

1084
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,750
mean I was trying to I was doing the

1085
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,730
Superman thing the sort of martyred

1086
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,230
teacher trying to make it possible to do

1087
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,969
this thing in the impossible environment

1088
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,579
and when I left a lot of my students had

1089
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:45,619
also done this educational academic work

1090
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:46,759
with me and they said what are you going

1091
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:47,690
to say when you leave here I said I'm

1092
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,130
gonna say this is my time in the

1093
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:52,309
trenches I tried to get into the system

1094
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,710
and make a change and we're still hated

1095
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:56,840
here there's still a bunch of messes

1096
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,820
with what this is there's lockdowns and

1097
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,250
for nothing if we uh here's a satellite

1098
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,200
image they mowed it after i left i'm

1099
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,539
told so this is supposedly September of

1100
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,919
2013 you can still see some shadows

1101
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,539
which suggests that maybe some some

1102
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,280
shrubs there have survived but you can

1103
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:11,650
see the paper stones you can see the

1104
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,940
curly river

1105
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,610
and I could say a few things about the

1106
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,849
other stuff we did and then you can ask

1107
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,840
me more about this so other responses to

1108
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:21,400
some of these challenges I've laid out

1109
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,470
to you there's this greenhouse

1110
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,530
simulation type of thing I did with grow

1111
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:29,319
lights we tried to make labs work very

1112
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,300
challenging design competitions practice

1113
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,920
exams and student produce field guides

1114
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,660
you've maybe seen one of these things I

1115
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,789
generally don't love these things I mean

1116
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:37,899
makes a lot of sense to do without the

1117
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,550
lights but if you've got nothing but

1118
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,680
vertical space this is how you do it and

1119
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,240
this is in an all cement room and I got

1120
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,159
two of these things on that state budget

1121
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,929
based on the fact that i used the logic

1122
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,190
of good time i got the state to give me

1123
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:49,779
an appropriation to buy two of these

1124
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,679
things and give every 12 trays of plants

1125
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,720
they could mess around with in the

1126
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,789
winter and i would engage the students

1127
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,618
in the real study of biodiversity so we

1128
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:58,929
had a student from cameroon we studied

1129
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:01,390
the plant the flora and fauna cameroon

1130
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:05,199
we started growing baobab trees from

1131
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:07,389
seed and these trays and declared that

1132
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,519
there would be a bell bad bonsai garden

1133
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:11,319
anyway

1134
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,610
we also got say cold frames that was

1135
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,869
another things we put cold frames there

1136
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,640
and also in other places in the garden

1137
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,550
that we've walked by as a way to try to

1138
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:20,440
get movement and try to get

1139
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,730
truly normalize it at the facility I

1140
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,230
don't know why I'm showing this one I'm

1141
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,329
showing this one because you see these

1142
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,309
things on people's desks those so you're

1143
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,019
not out of glass but there were peanut

1144
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:30,909
butter jars that people would buy in the

1145
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:33,519
commissary I mean the guys would scrub

1146
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,750
them clean and not really allowed but

1147
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,000
somehow they ended up in the classroom

1148
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,050
and what I'm doing there is people

1149
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,030
should be familiar with it's the soil

1150
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,400
shake test it's an old trick to

1151
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,900
introduce people to sew a particle size

1152
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,639
you know shake up a sample in some water

1153
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,470
and it's sediments out and you know you

1154
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:49,239
can use this oil triangle and give some

1155
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:52,179
approximation of what type of so you've

1156
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,829
got so this is the type of thing I would

1157
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,909
have to do is like figure out what could

1158
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:57,340
happen through this and what could

1159
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:58,539
happen through that I'm just giving

1160
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,950
examples from the soil class because

1161
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:03,849
that's happened to be one that I had at

1162
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:06,429
hand we actually did soil pits dug them

1163
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,500
and check out shovels and checked out

1164
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:10,269
the different

1165
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,780
stratification of soil layers I would

1166
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:15,940
take peds of the soil home photographic

1167
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,470
because there's no cell phones in prison

1168
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,030
there's no cameras available take it

1169
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:20,259
home photograph it and add it into the

1170
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,750
worksheet so people could see what we're

1171
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,950
getting at and so all these other things

1172
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,090
you might be surprised to hear you can

1173
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:26,949
have a piece of string you can have a

1174
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,088
piece of metal but

1175
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:31,659
what it looks like to get a bunch of

1176
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:33,219
inmates to dig a 60-inch soil pit right

1177
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:36,159
next to the fence of a prison inside of

1178
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:37,419
two watch towers with a hose sitting

1179
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,179
around that you could throw over the

1180
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,680
fence I mean that business with this you

1181
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,759
get an image of kind of my world just

1182
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,769
trying to explain that to a bunch of

1183
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,349
correctional officers folks that we're

1184
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:49,210
using the Excel things started to offer

1185
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:51,220
to make crossword puzzles every again

1186
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,780
we're in soil here but this would be an

1187
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:54,129
entire week production they trade it off

1188
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,260
and do a kind of blind review of each

1189
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,390
other like okay we got this thing and it

1190
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,040
was actually I'm widget eyes Dwinell

1191
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:01,629
things so that when you type in wrong

1192
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,769
letters it would give you the sense that

1193
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,680
you got them wrong and there's some kind

1194
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,670
of winning up the whole thing

1195
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,980
field guys this was another thing that

1196
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:12,970
the skin keeping the students occupied

1197
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,108
in thoughtful activity all day we that

1198
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:16,509
we allow the students to produce this

1199
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:17,769
field guide thing in them in PowerPoint

1200
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:20,020
getting towards the end I know we're

1201
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:21,969
getting late um there's one birch tree

1202
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:23,320
in the entire place we show so I bring

1203
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:25,358
in images of a show it was actually

1204
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,660
there there were this was a section

1205
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,369
header so is this is no frills

1206
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,389
PowerPoint feel good but this is a plane

1207
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,890
you saw all the time you were always

1208
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:34,000
kind of amazed we haven't even touched

1209
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,259
on the fact that most of these guys are

1210
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,480
coming from urban areas where there's

1211
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,740
not a lot of plants and I would say the

1212
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,480
name of the plants in the sidewalk and

1213
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:43,209
it was always like doc knows like way

1214
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,829
too many plants and so this is a way to

1215
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,179
kind of say bring in a picture that give

1216
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:47,380
us the name we're going to compete with

1217
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:49,539
you arrive and we're going to note these

1218
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,710
planes too so the weed section you'd see

1219
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,358
personally and people particularly loved

1220
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,400
it there this was like semi edible plan

1221
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,759
or whatever but it's also ubiquitous in

1222
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,108
Chicago the animal one is actually

1223
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,730
really interesting because a lot of this

1224
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:03,549
animal diversity only showed up because

1225
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,500
of the plant diversity that we had with

1226
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,579
the perennials and the drainage regime

1227
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,739
and doing different things to make

1228
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:10,619
habitat not intentionally for the

1229
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:13,269
animals but as a side effect

1230
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,700
so this is just a short list from an

1231
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:17,170
early version of this

1232
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,669
this is an animal those ubiquitous in

1233
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,800
Chicago and some people don't even know

1234
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:24,519
it's also in the prison you can hear it

1235
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,619
so this is even to have this in a prison

1236
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:28,239
environment where you could hear

1237
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:30,548
look at and learn the name of and the

1238
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,588
habitat of animals that you're seeing in

1239
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:34,900
great flocks I mean I'm talking about

1240
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:37,179
you got dumpsters of wasted soy food for

1241
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,619
inmates covered with crows every morning

1242
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:42,578
and people don't know if it's a crow or

1243
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:44,740
a grackle or a starling or whatever this

1244
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:45,940
was a real moment this was probably most

1245
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,439
interesting over the years when we have

1246
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,200
that drainage change we got there late

1247
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,639
goin crawfish returned to the garden

1248
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,469
probably from there from hundreds of

1249
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:54,788
years ago right there somehow they were

1250
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,588
hanging out in the drainage ditches I

1251
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:58,509
suppose around the prison and there and

1252
00:41:56,588 --> 00:42:00,969
someone who's staying in the garden you

1253
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:02,699
hear this holler go up there's a lobster

1254
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:05,018
in my garden

1255
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:07,018
and of course the watchtowers are like

1256
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:10,929
everyone hold still and it really like

1257
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:12,548
what's going on but so obviously this is

1258
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:14,108
a way to side of codify and make it into

1259
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:15,248
a learning moment when these things

1260
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:16,538
would come around finding these things

1261
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:18,248
in your guard but is that a good thing

1262
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,920
do I want this bug in here is this a bad

1263
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:22,088
thing what it what our worm castings are

1264
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,528
all over my garden bed we put a lot of

1265
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:24,639
compost in there and this is the final

1266
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:26,559
thing I'm going to say about this and

1267
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:29,230
I'll just do a wrapping statement we

1268
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,690
basically had you can't see the cursor

1269
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:34,358
here but we made these it's a hypertext

1270
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:36,489
so you know again absence of computer

1271
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:39,068
literacy a real liberal education you

1272
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:41,318
don't need to just give a career tech

1273
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:43,088
class you can teach writing you can

1274
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:45,420
teach genetics and through that

1275
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:48,759
introduced to people to reading pdfs

1276
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,789
could be email other things in this case

1277
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:54,460
hypertech so you could click on the the

1278
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:55,778
word crawfish and you'll go to it you

1279
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,659
could click on the word earthworm and

1280
00:42:55,778 --> 00:43:00,009
it'll go to that slide so so folks we're

1281
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,298
actually getting a very elementary

1282
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:03,068
introduction to how the internet works

1283
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:05,230
have you been in prison since the 90s

1284
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:07,358
you've never lived in a society that has

1285
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,608
cell phones just think about that for a

1286
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,998
second how are you how do you get a

1287
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:14,018
housing today computer you get a job

1288
00:43:11,998 --> 00:43:16,108
computer just imagine what folks are

1289
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:19,419
facing when they come in

1290
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:20,858
closing comment these were attempts to

1291
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,139
bring horticultural education into

1292
00:43:20,858 --> 00:43:24,340
prison as I said at the beginning the

1293
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:26,589
point near was not that I was trying to

1294
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,090
develop a special prison education that

1295
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,410
is totally different but rather than

1296
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,930
education that would be to the greatest

1297
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:33,279
extent possible the same as a good order

1298
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:35,469
culture education would be at a decent

1299
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,570
quality college campus I really only

1300
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:39,868
know of one other program that got as

1301
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:42,340
far as the Danville project in terms of

1302
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:44,260
including a pedagogy of sustainability

1303
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,850
it's called the sustainable prisons

1304
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,340
program it's I got to visit it when i

1305
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:51,039
was at UM never ever been state college

1306
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,619
in washington but none of the other

1307
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,989
projects i've seen have been as hands-on

1308
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:58,210
in the practice of food production while

1309
00:43:55,989 --> 00:44:01,089
simultaneously introducing an academic

1310
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:03,429
body of scholarly research and building

1311
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:06,160
ladders of opportunity that lead up to a

1312
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:07,839
university education and so on the

1313
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,118
limits to what was possible here were

1314
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,789
largely the consequences of my decision

1315
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,260
to work inside the prison and for

1316
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:16,119
various reasons while there are

1317
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,590
different limits I'm inclined to say the

1318
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,390
better point of leverage is to work from

1319
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,410
without the prison system i really do

1320
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:23,440
think that is the proper place for

1321
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:24,909
universities to work and that's where we

1322
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,119
find the work of the cornell prison

1323
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:29,199
education program and that's it i thank

1324
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,900
you for your time i welcome your

1325
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,129
questions and you're welcome to contact

1326
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,130
[Applause]

1327
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,429
we're supposed to many unfamiliar to you

1328
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:45,500
can describe how the university without

1329
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,500
an agenda what is that

1330
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:51,739
well the main thing is

1331
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,389
frankly the the psychological turmoil is

1332
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:56,479
much lower for someone that at least him

1333
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:57,889
come back to campus at all times and can

1334
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,780
have a community it really that's what

1335
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:02,719
the corners of education program is

1336
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:06,050
provided it is a sense that we were not

1337
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,759
to prison since there's a reason we're

1338
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,080
not

1339
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,750
fundamentally we're trying to create a

1340
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:12,949
culture of learning

1341
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,690
provide opportunities to people who are

1342
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:17,239
willing to work to apply to our school

1343
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,539
to gain a positive credential that will

1344
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:22,219
deal with them for the rest of life in

1345
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:23,869
prisons are about these people have been

1346
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:27,289
caught doing something wrong we're going

1347
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:29,059
to detain them and constrain what

1348
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:30,889
opportunities they have and give them a

1349
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,259
permanently negative record for the rest

1350
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:35,420
of area so we have to be different from

1351
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,250
it we can't just know this kind of

1352
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,519
dialectic you can try to have a spot

1353
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:42,650
where there's a collaboration

1354
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,719
but working there I felt myself becoming

1355
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,610
I can't really don't know how to put

1356
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,019
this and that's what happened to those

1357
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,760
other teachers that are described I

1358
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:51,530
haven't even talked about the GED

1359
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,790
teachers I mean you've got classroom

1360
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,980
that if gonna turn into a piece of the

1361
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:57,349
prison garage because of the bad power

1362
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,699
day and I don't want to run a program

1363
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:00,739
like that I don't think that's the place

1364
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:02,809
the university's ultimately find

1365
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:05,839
yourself the best position to do real

1366
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:07,639
research on what else bonita we

1367
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,450
fundamentally sign you off if you're

1368
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,710
never going to be able to publish

1369
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,509
anything ever going to talk about

1370
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,039
anything to get there and I mentioned it

1371
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,420
down when I started is one of the

1372
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,989
reasons they really put the fright into

1373
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,579
you of police power and so yeah a very

1374
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:21,229
hesitant and skittish to say anything

1375
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,699
the repercussions would have gone to my

1376
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,190
students who I want to see turning into

1377
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:29,149
those jerk

1378
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:31,700
other question yeah so in the court of

1379
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,269
garden based learning we work with folks

1380
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:37,808
statewide and the number of settings and

1381
00:46:35,268 --> 00:46:40,459
we have for many years and our our

1382
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:44,080
guidance to folks whenever we begin

1383
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:46,900
working with starts to do a really

1384
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,480
stellar job with something really small

1385
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,789
working with everybody across all the

1386
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,730
layers of administration and to do a

1387
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:57,460
beautiful job you can always grow and

1388
00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:00,579
you know just watching this I'm both

1389
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,699
like wow and tired out from the

1390
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:07,900
presentation if you were to do it again

1391
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:09,969
and looking back on what I mean you

1392
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,230
called yourself you know the Superman

1393
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:16,358
approach what would you do

1394
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:20,769
initially and do just an absolutely

1395
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:23,170
stellar thorough thoughtful amazing job

1396
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:26,139
knowing you know all the rest can follow

1397
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:30,960
if you have a successful experience how

1398
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:30,960
would you begin again can you briefly

1399
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:37,150
yes so this question is given the hell

1400
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,440
expensive and Superman light that I was

1401
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,500
attempting to be here and that I've

1402
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,079
heard that definitely let's

1403
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,340
get out of this

1404
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,509
what would you say to someone else who's

1405
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,200
coming into this what would you do

1406
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,840
different and would it be worth it to

1407
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:53,319
consider us a small good success instead

1408
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,960
of a big for now

1409
00:47:53,320 --> 00:48:00,530
yeah I think that you've barely got some

1410
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:02,619
some insights there and as candidly I

1411
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:06,980
was really trying to

1412
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:09,710
provoke the edge between the very tight

1413
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,990
environment and you know the liberal

1414
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:16,429
education interested in seeing being a

1415
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:17,869
contributor to come just a few things I

1416
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:19,399
would refuse to take this job if they

1417
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:21,139
didn't give a winter break a spring

1418
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,880
break a summer break and some off time

1419
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:25,219
for the students particularly in the

1420
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,180
winter I'd be fine to be that intensive

1421
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:27,889
for nine months and had to be a

1422
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:29,869
nine-month of what they wanted it to be

1423
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:31,879
12 months I mean I work today and after

1424
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:35,179
before and after Thanksgiving it worked

1425
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,309
December 24th January first and these

1426
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:40,339
guys were abandoned by to put everything

1427
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:42,320
else so a lot of us here notice who were

1428
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,329
from the prison program when you leave

1429
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,190
those students in the prison it can be

1430
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:47,659
emotionally hard to do this and so it

1431
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,090
became a way that I dealt with it was to

1432
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:52,399
just dive in the better thing would have

1433
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,780
been to say was have a period of rest if

1434
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,530
folks at voc and let they'll get over so

1435
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:59,810
the teacher can put her

1436
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:02,390
I would also start off with a kurta I

1437
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:03,860
basically developed this curriculum no

1438
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:05,299
know how much it is just to develop a

1439
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,800
syllabus I at least be developed nine

1440
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,530
courses on those for six months that

1441
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,390
I've been cut quite the teaching load

1442
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,820
was absolutely unsustainable and

1443
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:15,819
community colleges are often guilty of

1444
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:19,519
this as a las through their budget

1445
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:21,860
but I handed this off to another person

1446
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,929
who took this on it and I gave every

1447
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,400
single powerpoint presentation I had

1448
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:26,599
actually begun to the fluoride set up a

1449
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,789
situation like this you could do over

1450
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:30,949
their projections the library was in

1451
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:33,170
fact the cold Frank were there walks in

1452
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:35,569
security tool room the grow lights the

1453
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:38,119
tools to inmates that were assigned to

1454
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,830
be assistance to the program in that

1455
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,809
person learn after teacher so but at

1456
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:43,279
least if I started there I think would

1457
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:46,340
have been interesting to see if I can 85

1458
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,560
years two minutes instead of two and

1459
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,200
then we have um Cornell program is

1460
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,219
there's a kind of dynamic carriages

1461
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:54,439
there's a lot of time I found in group

1462
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:55,969
that really extends them so far but then

1463
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,070
is also very exposed because the

1464
00:49:55,969 --> 00:50:00,529
facilities the correctional folks see

1465
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:02,840
those like individuals as having pushed

1466
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,250
it too far and so you see the initial

1467
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,480
group kind of pulled back a little bit

1468
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,119
in another group I don't make something

1469
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,670
sustainable this program still exists I

1470
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,779
don't know the current teacher so it was

1471
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,360
hard but I know they've got those

1472
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:17,920
computers there and they've got these or

1473
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,920
some version of what we started

1474
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,899
thank you for doing this really I'm

1475
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,840
really moved by your work there but I'm

1476
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:31,200
wondering if you have any hope for shows

1477
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,670
like orange is the new black what do you

1478
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,579
think that could kind of galvanize

1479
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,409
people towards prison reform efforts

1480
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:39,719
just by bringing it to more to the

1481
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,789
mainstream media and letting people see

1482
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,139
the micro aggression with some things

1483
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,219
that you're talking about that's

1484
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:45,569
actually a very good question you know i

1485
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:47,539
think that the media has played a big

1486
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:51,869
role in the past years of

1487
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:53,909
wanting portrayal of carceral spaces and

1488
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:55,500
that'd be an example of it because

1489
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:57,000
pluses and minuses to that show when

1490
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,139
you're really in these places you and a

1491
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,880
lot of people think that one prison

1492
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,829
they've seen is representative of the

1493
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,809
whole system and so any writer or any

1494
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:05,759
person like me can fall into that

1495
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:07,590
fallacy but i think that there's a lot

1496
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,330
better in just because i know i haven't

1497
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,610
seen the series full but i know there's

1498
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:13,230
a habit of going back and showing where

1499
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,610
these stories started and you heard

1500
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,929
almost everyone that I've got a story

1501
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,240
about it's like starting at the age of

1502
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:20,549
12 certainly be 15 from the first

1503
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,739
incarceration of hers and so it's hard

1504
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,820
for us to blame our own built-in 15 year

1505
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,129
olds for everything they can do because

1506
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,960
they're obviously making bad choices and

1507
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,369
so similarly there I think some of that

1508
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,710
work is actually really good in building

1509
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:33,140
some semblance of empathy between groups

1510
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:36,659
the probably don't meet each other

1511
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:38,819
even better I think its programs like

1512
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:40,289
Cornell's programs which this semester

1513
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,180
sending over a hundred people into three

1514
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:44,608
correctional facilities to actually do

1515
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:46,049
that ectly know these folks to actually

1516
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:48,719
know what's going on when math phobia

1517
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:50,609
kicks in and you realize i'm actually go

1518
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,589
to college and I just had a real

1519
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:54,630
psychological barrier around algebra and

1520
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,160
I can get a college degree unless I get

1521
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,960
past this but here's some folks from

1522
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,219
Cornell a totally different community

1523
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,920
than me totally different level of

1524
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:03,029
access to the resources coming in anyway

1525
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,090
and saying we're going to send you a

1526
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,830
tutorial we're going to fizik and help

1527
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,210
you with this we're going to let you do

1528
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:10,579
it a second time review this past

1529
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,949
failures and making it possible and

1530
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:15,349
giving folks a chance to decide whether

1531
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:17,210
they want to do it or not only you learn

1532
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:18,739
the personality the life stories opposed

1533
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,630
to do all this we're not there is

1534
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:22,609
personal counseling but I do you think

1535
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:24,140
that that actually there's a movement

1536
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,250
for college in prison that's the reason

1537
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,929
the White House was interested in this

1538
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,849
work when begs the way to us this

1539
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:29,929
Wednesday the one of our former students

1540
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:32,029
to talk to the secretary of education

1541
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:34,099
about the future through school and it's

1542
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:36,800
because we need to bring people together

1543
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:39,710
and I think that shows can try to do

1544
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,180
that but there's also definitely not

1545
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,470
sometimes they laugh at that I mean

1546
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:44,179
sorry sometimes I can tell like before

1547
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:45,549
laughing ready is it because that

1548
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:47,869
character is

1549
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,220
tragically sad and this is a quirky way

1550
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:51,559
presenting is arif laughing at them

1551
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:53,199
because they're being humiliated and we

1552
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:56,360
kind of enjoy seeing people

1553
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:58,039
impossible situation and all kind of

1554
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,470
contortions to survival present building

1555
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:01,969
I

1556
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:04,099
think we're out of time but i want to

1557
00:53:01,969 --> 00:53:08,259
thank wrong for a fascinating

1558
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:08,259
presentation so much

1559
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:18,099
this has been a production of cornell

1560
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:18,099
university on the web at cornell edu
