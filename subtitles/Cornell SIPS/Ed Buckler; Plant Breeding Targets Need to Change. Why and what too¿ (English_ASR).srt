1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,919
so i hope you've had a chance to read

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,199
some of these but we'll get back to it

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,960
later

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,279
i'm going to make the argument today

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,519
that plant breeding targets

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,039
need to pretty much fundamentally change

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,278
because we've accomplished

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,080
a lot of the key goals over the last

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,079
century

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,118
to talk about what we've accomplished

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,558
and what we

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,558
perhaps need to change too

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,519
and so before i get into it i want to

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,039
talk about how does change happen

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,320
we start off something we're familiar

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,000
with the shift to hybrids um

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,759
it was based on a technology

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
breakthrough uh

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,519
that essentially gave a 20 increase in

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,759
yields

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
and when it started to hit iowa as a

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,439
commercial product

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,839
it essentially swept it in about six

26
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,839
years

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
and of course these shifts aren't just

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,560
with corn and agriculture

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
the u.s car came in and essentially in a

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,478
10-year period

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
replaced the horse destroyed numerous

32
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,879
prior markets that had

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
listed lasted for millennia and it

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,438
essentially created

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,759
much of the 20th century economy

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,599
the shift that we remember much more

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,478
closely of course is the smartphone

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,599
shift again

39
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,319
in the the smartphone took over the

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,118
entire

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,359
market in about nine years destroyed all

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,359
sorts of other technologies that

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,599
had been out there separate industries

44
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,118
but also created lots of other

45
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:44,719
new technology areas social waves

46
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,319
and even enable remote work so how has

47
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,879
change impacted breeding

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,639
well i define breeding as the design and

49
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,118
selection of organisms for human

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,118
purposes

51
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,798
so while the technology and knowledge

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,320
and scientific discovery around

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,960
hybrid vigor really started around 1908

54
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,718
and but by the time it hits the market

55
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,038
in the 1930s

56
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,840
then you see this first big increase in

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,639
yield

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,560
and then through iteration and breeding

59
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,479
over the last 80 years we've had it

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
resulted in this eight-fold increase in

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
meigs yield

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
half from coming in from genetics and

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
half coming from agronomy

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,439
and that type of success has

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
dramatically

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,680
changed the shape of the united states

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,318
ag productivity gains have essentially

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,719
allowed time for modern life

69
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,479
the vast majority of americans no longer

70
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,199
live in rural environments

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,000
and only a small proportion of the us

72
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,359
now

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,439
is involved in farming that breeding

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,280
success has also resulted

75
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:51,120
in some ecological gains for example by

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,199
getting those higher yields the northern

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,000
part of the us now has 16

78
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,119
more forested land than did in 1900

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,360
despite having much larger populations

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,719
and of course internationally what's

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
happened with britain

82
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,080
is that now the vast majority of the

83
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,959
globe's population

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
has enough calories and protein a lot of

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,598
that comes from the efforts of people

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,439
like norman borlaug and the green

87
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,839
revolution to deliver

88
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,039
these changes in breeding and agronomy

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
globally

90
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,079
those were tremendous successes in the

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,959
last century but

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
what are this century's challenges i

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,120
think our first challenge

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
is really improving global diets while

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,640
the prior century

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,799
reduced the problem with insufficient

97
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,479
calories and protein we still have the

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,000
vast majority of the globe's population

99
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,238
with imbalanced diets

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
either poor nutrition or too many empty

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
calories

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
i think the vision we should be going

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,840
towards

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,199
is one where we've essentially

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,319
eliminated everybody with insufficient

106
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,199
calories for protein

107
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,399
by providing access to alternative

108
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,399
proteins

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
and really adapting those productive row

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,438
crops across the globe

111
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,199
and then the second area is we really

112
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,239
need to tackle these imbalanced diets

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,438
and they're talking

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,438
about making it accessible to get to

115
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,199
quality fruits and vegetables and all

116
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,120
sorts of microbial foods

117
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,878
if we can tackle those two issues then

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,680
most of the planet will have a healthy

119
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,560
diet

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,079
at the end of the century our other

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
giant challenge of course is dealing

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,519
with climate change

123
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,198
that means dealing with increased

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,918
temperatures it means

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
dealing with pests and diseases that are

126
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,560
destroying our crops

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,120
as they move into new environments

128
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
it means dealing with extreme weather

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
events

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,399
more floods more droughts and damaging

131
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
wind events

132
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,000
but of course plant breeding can also

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,399
play a key role in ameliorating these

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,079
issues of course we need to come up with

135
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,039
better abatement technologies in the

136
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,159
production

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,960
of energy but we also can

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,960
play as i'll discuss a really key role

139
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,560
in potentially doing carbon removal

140
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,159
so i think plant breeding should really

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,038
be focused in on

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
creating healthy diets a circular

143
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,279
agriculture

144
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,520
and sequestering carbon and so why

145
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,359
aren't we focused on these

146
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,359
i think it's because a couple other

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
demands have really been focusing our

148
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
attention

149
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,719
these other areas haven't been the big

150
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,639
focus

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
because plant breeding has been in the

152
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,960
middle of supporting

153
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,478
a massive seven-fold increase in protein

154
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
demand

155
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,199
that's essentially stretching over 90

156
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
years

157
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,038
to meet this protein demand essentially

158
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,519
half of all habitable land on the globe

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,360
is being used by agriculture

160
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,680
three quarters of that ag land is for

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
livestock and the rest of it's for crops

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
so essentially we're pretty much already

163
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,599
maxed out for use of

164
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,599
land

165
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,680
and the u.s really isn't any different

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
from the rest of the world

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,439
this is a graphic made by bloomberg and

168
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
you can see that livestock

169
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,199
really dominate land use across the u.s

170
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
and the proportion

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,439
of area we use for food we directly is

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,520
very modest

173
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,879
even if you look at our cropland

174
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,478
essentially

175
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,600
our form largest production systems

176
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,439
wheat hay soybean and corn are really

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
all about calories and protein

178
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,519
and a lot of them are all about really

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,000
supporting

180
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:29,198
these protein production systems

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
and so if you ask what is the food

182
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,199
system's biggest challenge

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,319
it's figuring out how to get nitrogen

184
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
and protein

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
into people's diets efficiently and

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
dealing with these increases in

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
population

188
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
and still many people around the globe

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
don't have enough

190
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,318
the issue is that humans already

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,918
dominate the nitrogen cycle

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
we control about fifty percent of the

193
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,758
nitrogen flux per year

194
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
in contrast we only control about six

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
percent of the carbon flux per year

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,319
and yet we still have a massive problem

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
with climate change

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,000
it's estimated that essentially half the

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,800
people on the planet are

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,478
here directly because of the invention

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
of the hoverbox nitrogen fixation

202
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,478
reaction

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,478
so we are in an area with nitrogen where

204
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,598
we're already with our current

205
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,279
production approaches essentially maxed

206
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,199
out

207
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:26,638
so why is the system so complex

208
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,639
uh why are we using so much well

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,079
a lot of it is because we have a very

210
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
complex system

211
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,839
for how nitrogen gets to you starts out

212
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,758
with us

213
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,679
essentially in the united states case

214
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,280
drilling a hole in the ground

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,560
extracting uh natural gas from that

216
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,318
creating hydrogen from that

217
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,598
plugging that into the harbor bosch

218
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
reaction

219
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,800
creating fertilizer injecting it into

220
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,878
the field

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
we hope our plants take up some of it

222
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,520
they're used to synthesize amino acids

223
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,918
which is then used for photosynthesis

224
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,959
it's then remobilized into the seed and

225
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,878
we harvest it

226
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,399
and then we give it to our livestock we

227
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
grow those animals we slaughter the

228
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,758
animals

229
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,120
and we eat the animals and so in each

230
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,240
one of these steps

231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,478
scientists and engineers and

232
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,319
and business people have farmers have

233
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,159
worked very hard to optimize them

234
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,199
but of course the problem is the total

235
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
number of steps here

236
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
it isn't just that harbor bosch

237
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,639
has issues it's that essentially

238
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,560
biological we got into the situation

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
because biological nitrogen

240
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
fixation is land inefficient so if you

241
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
compare

242
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
mage yields versus soybean yields

243
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,919
they're grown by the same farmers

244
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
on the same fields using the same

245
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,480
equipment and essentially maize yields

246
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:48,159
about three times as much per

247
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,240
acre as soybeans do and a lot of that

248
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,600
has to do with the amount of energy

249
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,000
soybeans used to fix nitrogen globally

250
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,320
we face a similar type of situation

251
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,159
for example in sub-saharan africa where

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
we're expecting to have the largest

253
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,120
population growth in the rest of the

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,240
century

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
essentially in order to

256
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,159
get sub-saharan africa to be

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,159
self-sufficient by 2050

258
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,159
we either need to vastly increase the

259
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,600
amount of land under agriculture

260
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,360
or vastly increase the amount of

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
nitrogen

262
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,800
and that is the fundamental trade-off

263
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
that

264
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,599
needs to go on in order to make some of

265
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,000
these areas across the globe

266
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
self-sustaining and i want to highlight

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,399
that nitrogen although it's critically

268
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,519
important

269
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,958
it's also one of the major inputs

270
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
and major energy costs and major farmer

271
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,719
costs

272
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,800
for their crops so although maize is a

273
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,519
very efficient crop more than 10 to 1

274
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,479
energy and

275
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,600
energy out over half of the energy input

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,680
is coming from the

277
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,278
nitrogen fertilizer

278
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,439
and if you look at the greenhouse gas

279
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,600
emissions for a crop like maize

280
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
over 80 percent of its greenhouse gas

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,680
emissions are coming from

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,679
nitrogen so we've talked about the

283
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,078
weaknesses of plants but of course

284
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,719
animals are actually the least efficient

285
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,278
portion of the process

286
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
with beef being the most inefficient at

287
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,600
only about three percent of

288
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,078
efficiency well eggs are actually quite

289
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,839
good

290
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:22,319
at 31 efficiency but overall

291
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,519
animals are very inefficient at

292
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,278
converting

293
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,278
input protein to human-consumed protein

294
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,000
how does nitrogen get to you we're

295
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,399
essentially using about one percent of

296
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
the

297
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,958
globe's energy to produce fertilizer

298
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,880
we lose about 50 percent of the nitrogen

299
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,559
when we try to get into the plants

300
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,958
and then we can essentially lose

301
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:52,000
anywhere from nearly 70 percent to 97

302
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:55,039
of that measuring amino acids as we

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,958
go through animal production so

304
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,879
i want to end here with essentially that

305
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,719
thought experiment how close could one

306
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,000
get to maximum efficiency what would

307
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
that look like

308
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,639
well a single person needs about 57

309
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
grams of protein per day

310
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,159
and we break that down into those amino

311
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,879
acids that make it up

312
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,679
we assume we get the nitrogen through

313
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,360
some

314
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:20,479
energy process such as plasma generation

315
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
of fixed nitrogen we're then going to

316
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
get the carbon from glucose

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
and that could come from something like

318
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
maize that works out to be

319
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
about half an year per day and if we

320
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,600
scale that across the globe

321
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,239
essentially you could feed 7.6 billion

322
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,959
people

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,039
on about 21 million hectares of land

324
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,479
that's about the area of kansas and if

325
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,838
you look globally

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,920
essentially 1.5 percent of

327
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,839
global arable land could fix all the

328
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,039
carbon needed for the global protein

329
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,120
demand

330
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,759
so on a straight chemical processing

331
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,399
point of view

332
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,360
it doesn't actually take that much land

333
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,000
to produce

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,240
all of the protein necessary to support

335
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,919
the planet

336
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,240
so from a straight chemistry point of

337
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,919
view yeah it looks like it could be

338
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
fairly straightforward to support the

339
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,399
planet

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,919
but does any of this make economic sense

341
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,839
this is the type of question that

342
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,519
rethink x

343
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
was asking and they published a report

344
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
on this last year

345
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,638
and i would highly recommend that

346
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
everybody take a look at that

347
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,079
but their central premise is that

348
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,919
precision fermentation

349
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,078
essentially the production of high

350
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,039
quality proteins

351
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,838
this basic biology has really been

352
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,599
figured out

353
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
and engineering has been figured out

354
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,800
over the last five or ten years

355
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,278
and it gets continuing to roll out and

356
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,919
so

357
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,759
in the next four years they expect those

358
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,759
precision high quality proteins to only

359
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,278
cost about ten dollars per kilogram by

360
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,240
2024 and down to as low as one dollar

361
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,600
per kilogram

362
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,200
by 2035 and because of that they

363
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,480
expect nearly a 70 reduction in cows

364
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,240
because essentially those production

365
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
numbers are so low

366
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,159
that these high quality proteins will

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,159
out compete animal protein in the market

368
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
they've modeled how precision protein

369
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
costs have developed

370
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,759
over time starting with things like

371
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,719
insulin and then

372
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,039
industrial enzymes for cleaning and now

373
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,079
industrial enzymes for

374
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,480
biofuels and cellulose breakdown

375
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,679
and now we're moving into the period

376
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,759
where we're using these precision

377
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,359
proteins for food production

378
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,039
and so what they've done here is

379
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
essentially taken us to where we were

380
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,399
a couple years ago and essentially are

381
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
modeling with

382
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
scaling and improvements in for example

383
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,600
new technologies like continuous flow

384
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,679
fermentation

385
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,278
they expect these to continue to drop

386
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,319
for yet another decade

387
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,720
one of the key predictions is that

388
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
they believe that industrial products

389
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079
such as

390
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
whey and casing which are really chosen

391
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,958
and used by industrial food processors

392
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,679
we want the first areas to be disrupted

393
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,838
and they're

394
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,439
predicting that milk protein costs will

395
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,639
essentially cross over

396
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,440
with the weigh-in caseins costs in about

397
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,440
four years from now

398
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,680
and because there isn't uh

399
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,199
consumer preferences don't play a strong

400
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,278
role here they think that this

401
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:26,719
will transition will essentially occur

402
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,720
pretty much straight on price

403
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
the one that we probably know about more

404
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,079
in the market is essentially

405
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,919
fermentation

406
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,078
based beef you can think of impossible

407
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,120
burgers here where essentially people

408
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,278
are

409
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,839
taking plant proteins and adding things

410
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,600
like hemoglobin to them

411
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,639
there they think the prices are roughly

412
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
going to cross over by 2021

413
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
and then cell based beef they're

414
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
predicting that those

415
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,079
prices will cross over by 2025.

416
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
i think the cell based beef one is much

417
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,359
less clear

418
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,879
as to where that one's coming in on but

419
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,639
essentially those are their two

420
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,639
key predictions and

421
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,360
you know as i started out in our

422
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,600
discussion they essentially

423
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
believe that they're going to try to

424
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,159
eliminate

425
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,320
animals from the food system and

426
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,360
that they can cut undercut these price

427
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,639
points dramatically relative to

428
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,039
what animal production can and as you

429
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
see

430
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,439
even for dairy they hope to essentially

431
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,078
collapse the industry

432
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,199
so i think the question is are these

433
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,039
just

434
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,000
braggadocious claims or is there

435
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,000
something real to it

436
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,399
well the first thing i would highlight

437
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
is that essentially in the last few

438
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,240
years

439
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,839
44 alternative protein companies have

440
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,959
already

441
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,240
been started up and even in a year like

442
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,278
this

443
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,680
they're getting vast amounts of venture

444
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,559
capital invested

445
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,479
and so i want to take a look at some of

446
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,479
the underlying assumptions

447
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,039
behind this to see if this is at all

448
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,039
realistic

449
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,439
and so what i've plotted out here is

450
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,959
essentially the landscape of protein

451
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,199
prices

452
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,679
and on the left-hand side essentially

453
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,519
these are various animal proteins

454
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,838
um they're essentially their wholesale

455
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,440
prices and what i've

456
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,720
listed here is the cost of that item

457
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,120
their wholesale price and dollars per

458
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
kilogram of protein so we're assuming

459
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
that the only thing we're buying the

460
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,278
item for is forage protein

461
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,480
in the middle if you look below these

462
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,120
are pretty much

463
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
the high quality plant proteins that

464
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,600
we're used to

465
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,799
and then on the right hand side

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
essentially these are

467
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,159
various types of feedstocks and

468
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,800
fermentation

469
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,639
products that have high levels of

470
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,319
protein in them

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,959
and i'll highlight a few things here uh

472
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,639
that in terms of some of these costs of

473
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,838
you know peanuts and things like that

474
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,199
are in the middle here

475
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,838
some of you may have known i talked

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,360
about muscles a while ago and they're

477
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,519
right here they're actually the cheapest

478
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,198
animal protein that are out there

479
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,959
and the final thing i want you to

480
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
highlight is that the red bars are

481
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
essentially what we think x

482
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,360
believes these cost per proteins will be

483
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,438
at various time points

484
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:28,078
today is the red bar

485
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
in five years from now they believe that

486
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,359
precision protein will be at 10

487
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:36,319
per kilogram and then in 15 years from

488
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,479
now it'll be down here

489
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,399
so let's start with a species i know a

490
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,279
lot about corn

491
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,200
and corn's cost of protein is a little

492
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,639
bit above that one dollar per kilogram

493
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,279
because it's mostly a starch product but

494
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,880
today a lot of that corn goes into

495
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,038
production of ethanol

496
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,000
and that goes on to supporting

497
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,919
auto industry but the residual from that

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,079
is dry distillers green

499
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,160
those dry distillers grain are actually

500
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,720
the cheapest source of protein

501
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,840
you can buy on the planet so those are

502
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
then fed

503
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,439
to for example beef and there's

504
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
essentially

505
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
nearly a 65-fold difference between the

506
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,880
cost of that protein

507
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,519
and the cost of ground beef

508
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,080
and that's the fundamental aspect is

509
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,918
that price difference between those two

510
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:34,000
is where economic opportunities for

511
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
precision protein comes in

512
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,839
so rethink x is really predicting

513
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,038
disruption

514
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:43,279
of a couple key markets the first one

515
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,160
is that dairy market with casein and

516
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,960
whey

517
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,840
which represent about 40 of the dairy

518
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
market

519
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,279
and there you have nearly about

520
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,640
seven-fold differential and

521
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,399
ventral price and the other market

522
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,480
is for things like ground beef where

523
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,120
there's this 30-fold differential

524
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,440
between the cost of precision protein

525
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,439
and the cost of ground beef

526
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,639
is this one dollar per kilogram number

527
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,480
even possible

528
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,840
and so the first thing i would highlight

529
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,160
to you all is dry distillers grains

530
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,079
are certainly not a refined protein but

531
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
they're already well below that price

532
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,599
point

533
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,519
soybean you're not going to do it

534
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,519
probably directly from soybeans

535
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,798
they essentially cost the same as this

536
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,879
dollar per kilogram

537
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,440
soybean meal is also probably too close

538
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,320
in order to do it

539
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,600
but if you look at the cost of ammonia

540
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,678
and sugar

541
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,399
or if you were to really shift it to

542
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,120
ammonia and starch

543
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
and you had onsite production of ammonia

544
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,199
and various

545
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,038
aspects you can imagine that you your

546
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,080
feedstocks would cost about 1

547
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,279
8 the cost of that refined precision

548
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,480
protein

549
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,798
so i think it's certainly biochemically

550
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,558
possible to get to this one dollar per

551
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,038
kilogram

552
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,240
price point which could be incredibly

553
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,839
disruptive

554
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,319
to all other production systems of

555
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:17,199
protein so i think it's possible

556
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,319
and i think it's could happen in the

557
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,919
next 15 years

558
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:26,639
so if you go with rethink x's estimates

559
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,400
you're talking about essentially massive

560
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,720
impacts on land use

561
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,880
and economic livelihoods because

562
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,159
essentially half of all land has been

563
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
used for

564
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,720
various types of agricultural production

565
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,119
and the majority of that is for

566
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
livestocks

567
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,759
one way to think about this is that

568
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,080
roughly 2 billion hectares of rangeland

569
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,079
may no longer have a livestock market

570
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:53,599
so what would this look like for just

571
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,798
u.s

572
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,918
corn and soy land well there would

573
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:03,279
likely be a massive drop in the need for

574
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,200
livestock feed by mid-century processed

575
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,960
food may slightly go up in order to

576
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
support some of these systems

577
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,279
and industrial carbon would likely go up

578
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,880
substantially in order to

579
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:17,119
support things like plastic but still

580
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
nearly half of the acreage would not be

581
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,199
needed to support

582
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,279
current markets so this could either go

583
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,919
into ecosystem services which we'll talk

584
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,038
about more

585
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,960
later or the land could go compete in

586
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,960
things like the wheat market

587
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,960
but if it competed in the wheat market

588
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,600
this is enough land that essentially

589
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,558
could produce

590
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,199
half of the globe's total wheat meat and

591
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,079
would likely

592
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,798
displace other producers around the

593
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:46,319
globe that were less efficient

594
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,319
so what then would be the risk for

595
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,439
smallholders or rural communities

596
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,678
globally

597
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
well you could imagine dairy markets

598
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,080
pretty much disappearing

599
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,679
land values crashing and essentially

600
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:02,720
meat markets may be cut in half

601
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,360
and so those are all really big issues

602
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,400
for

603
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,839
how we support and think about these

604
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,679
types of transitions

605
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:14,399
that it i think could potentially come

606
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,159
so in the case of small holders how

607
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
could they take advantage of these types

608
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,320
of changes

609
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,399
well one way to kind of think about it

610
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,720
is this precision

611
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
fermentation systems really micro

612
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,558
brewery scale from matters

613
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,279
and they're maybe on the scale enough to

614
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,119
support

615
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,119
a thousand to ten thousand people

616
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,839
and they can produce a wide range of

617
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,918
different products everything from beer

618
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,000
to precision protein water soluble

619
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,440
vitamins lipid soluble vitamins

620
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,960
to really support most of some of the

621
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,720
key needs and nutrients

622
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,840
that people need and the inputs are

623
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
relatively simple things like major

624
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,119
cassava

625
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,279
and then ammonia either coming from the

626
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:03,038
hubble bosch reaction or from

627
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,038
electric arc type reactions

628
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,440
so how could some smallholders take

629
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,640
advantage of these changes

630
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,720
well currently most of the nitrogen that

631
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,960
is used for things like crop is coming

632
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,319
by inner cropping from legumes and other

633
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,440
types of biological nitrogen fixation

634
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,200
but if we imagine that essentially we're

635
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,360
shifted over to a world where maybe

636
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,038
we're having low protein maize

637
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,558
we maybe would actually recycle some of

638
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,679
that nitrogen and

639
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,000
increase nitrogen levels in the soil and

640
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,000
then

641
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,119
additionally reduce animal consumption

642
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,960
of stover could

643
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,278
both enhance carbon and soil nitrogen

644
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,240
and so then you're getting starch and

645
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,278
oil from

646
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,679
crops like maize and protein from

647
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,278
inner crop legumes and then you're

648
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,798
getting additional protein additional

649
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,519
nutritional balance from these

650
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,918
microbrewery type of approaches

651
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,240
they're being driven from the starch in

652
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,799
these various crops

653
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,359
so i think although that we're talking

654
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,200
about lots of instability there are some

655
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,479
positives that you could see for

656
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,159
smallholders

657
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,640
potentially greater food security

658
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,760
nutrition micro markets and co-op

659
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
fermenters

660
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,359
potentially better soils and higher crop

661
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,839
yields

662
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,839
due to better nitrogen balance in soils

663
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,240
so currently i think we're at a place

664
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,880
where plenty could be focused on these

665
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,798
things

666
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
but i think we really should be focused

667
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,278
in on healthy diets

668
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,960
a circular agriculture and sequestering

669
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,038
carbon

670
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,400
so let's first turn to healthy diets i'm

671
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,839
not going to go into a lot of detail

672
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,600
here because i think

673
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,558
a lot of people in our community know a

674
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:45,199
lot more about how to do this than i

675
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,759
but essentially i think we should really

676
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,240
be of

677
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,079
breeding for both flavor nutrient and

678
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,319
controlled environments

679
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,158
whether that's michael missouri's mini

680
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,119
butternut squash

681
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,840
mike goers work in producing high

682
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,558
protein

683
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,319
vitamin a or neil matson and colleagues

684
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,599
working on controlled environments i

685
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,599
think these are all really

686
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,038
key areas where we should be targeting

687
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,558
our breeding towards

688
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,319
in order to create a much wider better

689
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,839
set of products coming out of each of

690
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,839
these environments

691
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,480
so this is where i think new efforts

692
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,400
like usda's green insight can be a

693
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
really a great key partner

694
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
in helping us breed for things like

695
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
flavor nutrient and controlled

696
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,959
environments and i know

697
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,400
ars and more want to make this a high

698
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
priority and i hope we can all work

699
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,679
together

700
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,039
towards those goals the next area that

701
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,720
plant bridge should really focus

702
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,720
on is circular agriculture

703
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,559
and so when we talk about circular

704
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
nutrient economies what we're talking

705
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,879
about

706
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,639
is taking the amount of nitrogen

707
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,960
phosphorus that we certainly need for

708
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,799
growth of our plants to produce the food

709
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
and everything and essentially just

710
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,480
reducing it and keeping more of the

711
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,319
nitrogen on farm

712
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,759
and re-mobilize it through the year so

713
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,079
we don't need as much

714
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,558
nitrogen to be brought onto the farm

715
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,558
each year

716
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
and just a reminder in the case of maize

717
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,000
for example

718
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:17,200
over 80 of those greenhouse emissions

719
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,519
are coming from nitrogen

720
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,880
and then we have issues such as runoff

721
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,839
going into things like the gulf of

722
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
mexico

723
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,959
nearly 60 of the nitrogen in the gulf of

724
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,480
mexico is coming from agriculture

725
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,400
and these loss of nutrients is an

726
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,919
economic loss to the farmers

727
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,880
and it's an environmental cost

728
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,159
so one of the big targets we need to

729
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,039
focus on implant breathing

730
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,799
is really breeding for entire agro

731
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,359
ecosystems

732
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,240
cover crops and perennials we know if we

733
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,000
combine them

734
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,159
and the integrated breeding management

735
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,480
can really improve both soil biology

736
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,278
nutrient cycling drought and flood

737
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,278
tolerance

738
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,839
and i think a lot of these tools we're

739
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:00,159
talking about can be brought together

740
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,599
in order to rapidly breed for cover

741
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,840
crops to support

742
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,439
a lot of our major row crops and make

743
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,759
them much more

744
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,480
circular but i also want us to think

745
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,278
in other ways about how we can create a

746
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,798
circular

747
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:19,119
agriculture fall colors are a reminder

748
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,639
of how perennials are recycling nitrogen

749
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,239
and phosphorus the reason we're seeing

750
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
those colors is they've already moved

751
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,038
all their nitrogen and phosphorus out of

752
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,159
the leaves

753
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,839
and are saving that for the next year

754
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,640
which of these strategies can we borrow

755
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,639
for agriculture

756
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
we've been thinking about concepts for

757
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,679
example about low protein

758
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,480
maize where if you look at it easier

759
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,000
there's while it's not high in protein

760
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,839
because it's yield is so high there's

761
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,919
nearly 800 kilograms

762
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,599
per hectare of protein in a maize field

763
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,679
and if you think about that that's this

764
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,879
roughly the same amount of protein

765
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,798
that's in 14 head of steer

766
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,360
so what if we were able to kind of save

767
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,440
that back into the ground or reuse it

768
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,199
somehow for that coming year

769
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,720
could we drop the protein down where

770
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
it's not really being used very

771
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,839
effectively

772
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,439
and save it for the next year and that's

773
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,519
fundamentally the question

774
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,519
that travis rooney has been asking in

775
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,960
our group

776
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,519
he's been wondering can we make annuals

777
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,600
more like perennials and if you look at

778
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,839
the conventional major variety we take

779
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,839
lots of nitrogen and phosphorus

780
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,000
we add to our plants and we get both

781
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,639
volatization

782
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,038
and runoff of these and so we get big

783
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
losses of nitrogen phosphorus there and

784
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:40,480
then we pick up the grain

785
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,399
and we use a lot of the starch

786
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,839
and there's some uses for the protein

787
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,199
but for example we have too much

788
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,678
phosphorus in our pig lagoons and so on

789
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,360
and he's asked the simple question well

790
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,200
can we use that nitrogen phosphorus of

791
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,639
course during the growing season

792
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,720
but then leave it in the cobs and not

793
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,799
leave put in the kernels and essentially

794
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,278
then recycle those cobs

795
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,440
each year so that essentially we take

796
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,599
off the starch but we've really

797
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
focused on recycling the nitrogen and

798
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,558
phosphorus

799
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,399
for the coming year

800
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,839
and we've already talked about circular

801
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,558
agriculture and that can play an

802
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,359
important

803
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,319
role in reducing greenhouse gases and it

804
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,359
plays a role

805
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,879
in this top part of the graph where

806
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,479
it's either whether it's energy

807
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,880
production or

808
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
all sorts of other approaches we need to

809
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,640
really reduce

810
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,079
total co2 outputs fertilizer production

811
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,120
requires one percent of the globe's

812
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:43,359
energy the nitrous oxide coming off

813
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:46,319
our crops are major greenhouse gas and

814
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,879
there's greater and greater efficiency

815
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:53,119
here as a double win for both farmers

816
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,120
and the environment

817
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,879
so i'd like to now turn to what could

818
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,519
plant breeding do

819
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
to really sequester carbon by the end of

820
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,319
the century

821
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,960
we need to develop plants that would be

822
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,158
sequestering about 20 gigatons of co2

823
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,278
per year

824
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,440
there are a number of important

825
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,919
industrial sectors that still require

826
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,320
carbon compounds for decades to come

827
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,559
these need to be serviced first in order

828
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:21,038
to eliminate the use of fossil fuels

829
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,639
before we focus solely on carbon

830
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,240
so sequestration think there's three

831
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
main areas where plant breeding can play

832
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,038
a role

833
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,319
some of those are we're already doing

834
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,599
right now and that's like ethanol

835
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:34,319
production to replace gas

836
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,038
and you know these can be efficient

837
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:40,000
approaches

838
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,000
if we refine them with solar and wind

839
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,599
our plants can also be base polymers for

840
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,439
plastics

841
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,959
again if we solar wind energy is used to

842
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,080
process them

843
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,278
and then finally our plants and our

844
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,599
grasses can be used

845
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:59,759
for deep carbon uh sequestration

846
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,119
so i want to remind everyone that plants

847
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,359
are quite competitive in terms of

848
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,079
straight energy

849
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:10,158
on a dollar per joule basis they're much

850
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,158
better than wind or even natural gas

851
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,640
and this is where i think we need to

852
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,678
also look more carefully at

853
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,200
ethanol production and ask really why is

854
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,600
it not as efficient as we

855
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,960
would like it to be growing and

856
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,439
transporting

857
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,558
maize is really not the problem it's a

858
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,399
relatively minor

859
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,200
part of the total amount of

860
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:33,038
non-renewable energy that goes in

861
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,000
rather it's the ethanol conversion

862
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,359
especially the distillation of it

863
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,038
and this is where i think we should view

864
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,038
ethanol or like hydrogen

865
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,798
it's really an electron carrier and we

866
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,679
should use it and process

867
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,519
it with solar or wind energy to convert

868
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,240
it into a form that we can use

869
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,919
as a liquid fuel but it has of course

870
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,759
the major advantages relative to

871
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,799
hydrogen of already working

872
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:59,278
with the established market so

873
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,240
before we start sequestering carbon i

874
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,519
think

875
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,480
we need to make sure we're dealing and

876
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,200
have carbon neutral fuels and plastics i

877
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,278
would imagine

878
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,240
for example the transportation sector

879
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:12,480
yes it will

880
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,919
quickly in the next few decades maybe

881
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,720
convert to 75

882
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,320
electricity but it may still require

883
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,120
about a quarter of it

884
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,038
some kind of liquid fuel and things like

885
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,319
maize could essentially service it

886
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:28,319
quite well plastics again we need to

887
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,639
eliminate fossil fuels there

888
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,240
and there you could shift to essentially

889
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,440
100 renewable

890
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,200
with about 10 million hectares of maize

891
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,080
and as a really nice article by posing

892
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,720
a couple years ago highlighted you could

893
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,798
really go

894
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,960
greenhouse gas negative if you combined

895
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,440
it with renewable processing

896
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,720
and for both of these areas it's really

897
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,159
about the processing

898
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,919
that's key so now let's

899
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,640
turn our attention to sequestering

900
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,799
carbon fundamentally how do we pull

901
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,360
10 to 20 gigatons of co2 from air

902
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,240
well we do it all the time it's called

903
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,240
photosynthesis

904
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,720
and if you look at photosynthesis uh by

905
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,599
ecosystem

906
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,079
essentially across the globe it's nearly

907
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:21,918
450 gigatons per year

908
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,079
are being pulled out of the atmosphere

909
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,679
and if you divide through those

910
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,918
estimates from what the

911
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,880
national research council was estimating

912
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,600
to require

913
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,080
it's about two percent by 2050 and four

914
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,319
percent of that global photosynthesis

915
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,000
uh by 2100 and so those numbers don't

916
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,439
seem very big

917
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,919
but then you start to realize

918
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,720
well we really only manage a much

919
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,640
smaller proportion of those environments

920
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,159
and if you look at the ecosystems that

921
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
we manage

922
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,919
then you start talking about much larger

923
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,159
numbers you're talking about

924
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,320
using 5.7 and a little over 11 percent

925
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,278
of the photosynthetic capacity in the

926
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,278
sequester carbon

927
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,639
and now there's no way we could really

928
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,119
do this

929
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,919
if protein were competing for the exact

930
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,200
same land

931
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,279
and so this is where i think those

932
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,838
discussions we've had previously

933
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,000
on what's the nature of protein

934
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,759
production across the globe likely to be

935
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
over the coming decades is really

936
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,520
important it's essentially the same land

937
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,519
is needed for growth purposes

938
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,159
so as a reminder you know perennial

939
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,079
grasses out there already sequester

940
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,000
carbon and they grow very differently

941
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,679
from a lot of our annual crops

942
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,239
in the picture on the left what you see

943
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,639
is a perennial a native perennial grass

944
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,638
relative to annual wheat

945
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,000
and as you can tell they grow very

946
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,719
differently in terms of the root

947
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
structure

948
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,878
and everything else but

949
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,639
the question is can we shift where

950
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,598
they're putting some of their carbon at

951
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,599
the end of the year

952
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,239
and this is where i think there's an

953
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,880
opportunity for plant breeding really to

954
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,078
develop

955
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,079
deep persistent carbon and that could

956
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,119
happen both in our some of our annuals

957
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,400
and our perennials and if it's

958
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,079
accompanied with many of the other

959
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,800
optimizations we've already been talking

960
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,920
about

961
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,280
the overall harvest yield loss to above

962
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
ground part may be modest

963
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,320
turn to our model maze and asked the

964
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,159
question

965
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,240
what would carbon so equestrian maize

966
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,118
look like well

967
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,118
in a highly productive maze crop about

968
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,039
five tons of carbon is left

969
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,039
every year in the stover and about we

970
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,800
pull off about five tons

971
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:49,759
in terms of the harvested kernels

972
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,119
if we're willing to essentially to

973
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,440
create a mage plant that

974
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,680
say lost 10 percent of its yield and

975
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,920
maybe somewhat shorter we may be able to

976
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,118
essentially move essentially an

977
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,400
additional ton

978
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,280
of carbon every year down deeper in the

979
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,760
soil profile

980
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,320
now i do want to highlight that just as

981
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,920
we heard

982
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,519
last week from our soil science

983
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,320
colleagues deep carbon alone is likely

984
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,239
not enough carbon really needs to be

985
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,800
mineralized to be able to stay there

986
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,319
for hundreds or thousands of years and

987
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,920
so when we talk about that we talked

988
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,519
about complexing

989
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,599
that carbon with something like

990
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,320
magnesium or calcium

991
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,079
and getting it deep and so the questions

992
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
i think we have on the basic research

993
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,880
side

994
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,559
is how do we combine some of these

995
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,358
things we could do with plants

996
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:43,119
with how do we work with soil scientists

997
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,119
on figuring out how to mineralize it

998
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,039
so if we were to able to sequester

999
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,880
20 of the biomass to each of these areas

1000
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,960
across the united states you start

1001
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,800
counting up that a substantial

1002
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:03,358
number of gigatons of co2

1003
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,359
could be sequestered every year

1004
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:09,598
and that totals up to about 2.9 gigatons

1005
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:14,000
per year

1006
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,000
which is about 14 of the global target

1007
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,160
and if you think about in terms of

1008
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,039
dollar germs a lot of people are

1009
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,639
assuming

1010
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:25,920
that carbon could be priced at nearly

1011
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:28,400
50 per ton of co2 that would be

1012
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,159
essentially an equivalent to about 142

1013
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
billion dollar market by the end of the

1014
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:35,358
century

1015
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,240
for carbon sequestration so i think

1016
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,480
there are

1017
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,439
as you see a range of different ways we

1018
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,519
can go about

1019
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,240
using plant-breeding to tackle uh the

1020
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,759
the giant problems of carbon

1021
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,679
temperatures

1022
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,119
but just to give it a little friend of

1023
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,199
reference

1024
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,039
essentially if you compare the pro size

1025
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,519
of the problem of food production versus

1026
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,838
carbon agriculture just

1027
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,960
in straight amount of carbon carbon

1028
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,119
sequestration

1029
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,639
is about a six-fold larger problem than

1030
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,240
feeding people

1031
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,920
so this is a big problem and we're going

1032
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:12,239
to need to use a lot of different tools

1033
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,039
so what should plant breeding be focused

1034
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,838
on well i think it's really about

1035
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,239
healthy diets circular agriculture and

1036
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,920
about

1037
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,439
sequestering carbon but if you ask

1038
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,440
what our biggest challenges are in the

1039
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
21st century in breeding

1040
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,079
it's really figuring out how to solve

1041
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,280
both these goals which i think we can

1042
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,599
really do

1043
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
but we really need to be thoughtful in

1044
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,320
planning and work with

1045
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,759
consumers farmers and the environment

1046
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,838
to work through these massive

1047
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,599
transitions because none of these

1048
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,880
transitions are going to be small

1049
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,480
or easy

1050
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,599
so i thank you very much and i'd be

1051
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,599
happy to take some questions

1052
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,240
this has been a production of cornell
