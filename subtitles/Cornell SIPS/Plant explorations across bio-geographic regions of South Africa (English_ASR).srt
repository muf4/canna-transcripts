1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,179
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,179
University

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,120
uh thank you everyone for joining me

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,619
today and as the introduction alluded to

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,759
I'm going to talk about my experience

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,858
while on the Drear award and uh what my

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,179
main focus is in giving this talk is is

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,279
less to kind of walk you through my

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,600
experience in a chronological order but

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,579
more to share with you some of the

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,840
experiences some of the findings and

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,299
some of the things that I found to be

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,200
most interesting while experiencing the

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,759
biodiversity in South Africa

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,859
so I'm here in the Horticulture

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,539
department and it's been a number of

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,460
years working in Horticulture and as a

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,200
horticulturist whenever you come up and

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,000
you meet a plant you have to ask it

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,180
three questions

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,340
what is your name where are you from and

22
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,738
how did you get here and this is a great

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,660
picture of a ficus macrophila here in

24
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,058
South Africa this is meaning for scale

25
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,679
standing down here and these are the

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,419
kind of questions that I tend to like to

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,299
ask plants because they tend to reveal

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,159
very interesting stories and when I ask

29
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,019
this question of some of the plants that

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,580
I've experienced and seen throughout

31
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,099
visiting Gardens or other places around

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,259
the world uh one place kind of kept

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,839
coming up time and time again where you

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,260
just would find very unusual and

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,118
interesting flora and just something

36
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,799
that was just kind of outside the realm

37
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,379
of what we tend to tend to typically

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,820
find

39
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,859
so

40
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,899
as a lot of people know here in the

41
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,599
Horticulture Department South African

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,359
plants have had a large impact on the

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,559
Horticultural trade and you may or may

44
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,900
not realize this I'm going to go through

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,000
some examples right here of a bunch of

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,700
plants that you may not realize come

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
from South Africa so the zantendia the

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,259
calla lily is a very common plant that

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,079
is endemic to South Africa it has been

50
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,640
used and hybridized extensively for all

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,019
sorts of ornamental qualities

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,478
pellegonians the flowering geraniums a

53
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,658
plant that is completely ubiquitous in

54
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,179
use for planting and potting beds or as

55
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,560
a popular bedding plant is a genius of

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,379
plants that also comes from South Africa

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,959
nifophia the red hot poker a very common

58
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,359
ornamental plant that we tend to find in

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,199
Mediterranean climates and subtropical

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,000
regions is used extensively also comes

61
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,419
from South Africa

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,979
sterlitzia the bird of paradise and a

63
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,619
very interesting genus of plants there's

64
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,959
there's five species that comprise the

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,879
the Genera including some that grow as

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,098
largest trees but as we can see from

67
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,159
these pictures here also picked up and

68
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:44,060
used very commonly as a garden plant

69
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,060
ornamentally

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,400
the proteasier is a big is a large

71
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,199
family of plants but but one of the very

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,580
special components of plants that we

73
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,259
kind of see in South Africa a lot of

74
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,760
people when they think about the Western

75
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,378
Cape when they think about fine boss

76
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,239
this is one of the images that comes to

77
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,919
mind this idea this this protea this

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,420
this group of plants that is unique to

79
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,098
that region and we'll get into some of

80
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,219
these details as we go through the talk

81
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,079
uh proteas are used in as for fresh

82
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,699
flowers They're In the Flesh flower

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
industry but they also when you dry the

84
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,119
florets themselves can actually store

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,939
quite well and that's what this picture

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,739
is illustrating here on the right are

87
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,180
protea heads that have been cut and are

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,640
dried and are going to be shipped all

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,300
over the world to use for Cut Flower

90
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,299
displays

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,739
succulent plant biodiversity South

92
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,359
Africa boasts having roughly 30 percent

93
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,360
of the world's succulent plant

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,280
biodiversity and this is we find this

95
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,420
particularly in the Northwestern part of

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,799
the country

97
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,559
where we find all sorts of interesting

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,540
things like high diversity of aloes or

99
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,759
many of the plants in the Azo ACA family

100
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,340
such as haworthias or plants like

101
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,899
conifitums which are also commonly used

102
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,239
horticulturally people are very

103
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,680
interested in these plants for some of

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,560
the interesting adaptations they develop

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,219
but also because they're they're fun and

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,598
they're interesting and there's

107
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,180
something different we like to put them

108
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,158
in terrariums and other such uses such

109
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,260
as this

110
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,479
find them what used to be called white

111
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,079
books or lithos they're two different

112
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,079
Genera

113
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,780
uh and then the bulb biodiversity is

114
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,699
another

115
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,439
major you know we're going through a lot

116
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,000
of plants here and I hope to exposing

117
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,500
people to the kind of diversity that is

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,600
out there but here are just some some

119
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,100
great pictures of the bulb biodiversity

120
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,500
and even here in the Horticulture

121
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,820
Department we focus on some of our Labs

122
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,100
focus on

123
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:35,459
growing plants such as the ornithagalum

124
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,520
or as well as the um eukomis is another

125
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:41,279
Cut Flower and also bedding plant that

126
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,159
has also gained worldwide appeal and use

127
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,579
in the Horticultural world

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,860
and almost through one of the very

129
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,839
interesting things about uh about South

130
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,460
Africa is is known as some of the mass

131
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
flowerings up in namaqualand the

132
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,439
maquiland roughly refers to a region

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,120
that is the North Western uh part of

134
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,000
South Africa and they're known for

135
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,978
having these uh magnificent displays if

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,500
they get good rains in the in the winter

137
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:11,339
time when they get their precipitation

138
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,918
and uh and this is a phenomenon that's

139
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:18,239
been been noted for I want to say um

140
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,560
since the mid late or early 1900s and

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,720
just to kind of point out what's going

142
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,180
on here in particular this picture on

143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,680
the far right this is a picture taken at

144
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,418
one of the national Botanic Gardens

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,978
that's actually managed more of a

146
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,959
natural area and what you're looking at

147
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:32,879
here is is you can kind of see is just

148
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,739
the the vast diversity of different

149
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,538
bulbs that are that are blooming and

150
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,680
growing in this one set of land this is

151
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,439
a landscape that has been managed

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,199
primarily only by weed removal and maybe

153
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,079
having having grazing that came in and

154
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,639
causes a natural disturbance and this is

155
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,839
a highlight it brings people to this

156
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,819
kind of part of the country where most

157
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,719
people wouldn't go for tourism otherwise

158
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,219
but you contrast this to the shots here

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,259
this is a farm that's also in the

160
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,020
namaqualand region but they annually

161
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,300
plow to encourage these pioneering

162
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,519
species like the ursinias here that

163
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,600
cause this kind of mass carpet blooming

164
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,579
effect and as you can see from the

165
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
picture it just goes on and on and so

166
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,639
these these images of the mass blooms

167
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,220
have really captured people's

168
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,439
imaginations this is a picture of one of

169
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,060
the first it was actually taken by by

170
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,339
Hans Hera the first curator at

171
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,439
Stellenbosch botanic garden where I was

172
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,599
spending my Drew experience and this was

173
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,459
one of the first photo color photographs

174
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,680
to make it it was a postcard actually

175
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,859
and to make it to Europe and kind of put

176
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,000
this amazing biological display kind of

177
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,000
on the world stage

178
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,258
and you also find some of the the weird

179
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,220
and the wonderful so plants such as the

180
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,780
hid Nora Africana here which is a

181
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,300
parasitic plant that grows on euphorbia

182
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:51,059
and it's a piper rails

183
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,319
so related to aristocia or the

184
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,360
Dutchman's pipe that some people may

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,460
know as well as wonderful plants like

186
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,639
wellwitchie and mirabilis which is in

187
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,978
the nutella's order a very fascinating

188
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,840
plant it's the only species in its whole

189
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:07,379
family and this grows in the northwest

190
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,659
region up into Angola and Namibia uh in

191
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,639
in kind of this fog belt and just a very

192
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,819
unusual plant people have been Wonder

193
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,379
Amazed by it and interestingly enough

194
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,660
Stellenbosch botanic garden was the

195
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,659
first Garden to ever grow this plant

196
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,520
from seed and get it up to a point where

197
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,520
it would cone and set seed once again

198
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,360
so through that kind of display of of

199
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,400
pictures that I just showed you I hope

200
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,379
to have revealed just some of the things

201
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,120
that really make the biodiversity of

202
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,560
South Africa so fascinating so

203
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,598
interesting and something that's pretty

204
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,459
unusual compared to what we may see when

205
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,620
we walk out of our door

206
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,318
so I think the the natural question that

207
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,800
comes to mind is is why is South Africa

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,580
so uh biologically diverse when it comes

209
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,740
to to this vascular plant Flora and I'm

210
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,359
showing you an image here of what's

211
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,639
known as a flower show it's a flower

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,379
show in South Africa and this is in

213
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,478
large contrast to what we may experience

214
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,038
if we went to a flower show maybe like

215
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:06,959
the Philadelphia Flower Show or flower

216
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,519
show in Europe a lot of these kind of

217
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,680
flower shows that we may be used to are

218
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,538
kind of more contrived their their image

219
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,579
we will go and we'll see a plant but the

220
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,699
plant may not be the main display of the

221
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:21,060
focus or focus of the display

222
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,098
uh it may be more kind of ornamental

223
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,319
ornate or the scene they create around

224
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,000
it is going to be something

225
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,680
um that they kind of focus on

226
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,538
in South Africa

227
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,219
there's a number of town that hosts

228
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:34,559
these flower shows and at these flower

229
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,300
shows what farmers and local people in

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,859
that Community will go out just into

231
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,899
their fields just around the roadside

232
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,300
it's just anywhere that's around and and

233
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,458
they'll Harvest these massive amounts of

234
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,838
of just plants are going around these

235
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,059
weren't grown ornamentally just for

236
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,279
these displays this is just the natural

237
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,419
kind of abundance that's around and they

238
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:53,399
bring them and of course putting

239
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,019
together is kind of contrived in this

240
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,759
kind of context of having so many so

241
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,320
much with biodiversity or the plants

242
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,419
themselves stuck together in one place

243
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,459
but I like to share this image just

244
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:04,139
because it shows both a different

245
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,838
perspective of how South Africans

246
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:10,139
interact with their Flora but also just

247
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,180
the sheer mag magnitude of the of the

248
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,319
diversity that's there and these are

249
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,239
great experiences for getting people

250
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,860
interested in Horticulture in gardening

251
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,720
but they also have a large educational

252
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,039
component where they actually have

253
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,360
sections where they label all these

254
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,219
plants and you can go and you can kind

255
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,399
of actually learn what's around you as

256
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,399
well

257
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,979
so to kind of put South Africa in

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
context and put the Flora there in

259
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,120
context I'm going to start with with

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,120
North America a place that we're all

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,879
familiar with North America excluding

262
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,000
Mexico is north of Mexico makes up

263
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,338
roughly 15 of the Earth's surface and on

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,600
that 15 of the Earth's surface we have

265
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,700
about 6.25 of the world's total vascular

266
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,339
plant biodiversity 20 000 species

267
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,980
roughly

268
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,959
now we jump to South Africa and what

269
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,580
we're looking at here is less than one

270
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,699
percent of the Earth's surface so zero

271
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,560
eight point percent and 30 000

272
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,560
individual species so roughly 10 percent

273
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,639
of the world's total biodiversity so a

274
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,159
huge you know a huge amount of

275
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,039
biodiversity and relatively small space

276
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,958
and this distribution is not even across

277
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,679
the whole country there are certain

278
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,159
areas that have more speciation than

279
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,159
others

280
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,919
so to give to continue to give people a

281
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,959
context we're going to work from a large

282
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,399
scale and focus in

283
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,259
now there's multiple ways how people

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,000
choose to describe the different plant

285
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,379
communities that are around them and on

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,539
the biggest scale those scale we

287
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,820
typically look at is known as floristic

288
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,319
kingdoms and floristic kingdoms describe

289
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,540
relationships that are primarily between

290
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,700
family and on the general level and they

291
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,379
focus on three main different areas they

292
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,420
focus on distribution of these families

293
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:55,019
in general either being Cosmopolitan

294
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,578
very widespread being endemic very

295
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,940
narrow only occurring in a very small

296
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:01,500
amount of space or having disjunctions

297
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,519
large barriers between different types

298
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,039
of families

299
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,078
uh redwoods are a good example of that

300
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,958
while in China you may have the Don

301
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,120
Redwood metasochoic of distributes while

302
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,399
in North America you have the coastal

303
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,320
redwood or the giant Redwood would be an

304
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,879
example of Distinction

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,800
and what I want to point out in this

306
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,720
picture you know we can see that the

307
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,859
alarctic kingdom is the largest the one

308
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,440
that we're probably most familiar with

309
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,120
here but if we look down to the tip of

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,459
Africa we see that there's one little

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,100
section here that stands out in in pink

312
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:34,259
here and this is known as the the cape

313
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,579
floristic region and the reason why I

314
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,039
show this picture and kind of point this

315
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:40,859
out is that even on this scale even on

316
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,419
the larger scale of the earth what we're

317
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,000
seeing is that the there's something

318
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,679
going on down there that makes uh the

319
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Flora there so unique in its

320
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,759
relationships and families in general

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,379
that it that it highlights this one

322
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,939
region it's the only country in the

323
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,879
world that houses its own floristic

324
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,560
kingdom it's kind of a big way of of

325
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,958
looking at plants so there's some

326
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,539
subjectiveness to it but it's a good a

327
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,000
good General context

328
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:08,519
so now taking it one step down we step

329
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,740
into the levels of biomes

330
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,659
and what biomes primarily describe are

331
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,120
plants based on their structure how do

332
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,980
they overall look and on ecological

333
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,500
factors so the main factor is that

334
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,839
people use to describe Flores based on

335
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,659
biomes are going to be minimal uh winter

336
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,760
temperature seasonality of rainfall and

337
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,639
then summer air Rarity how dry it gets

338
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,958
in a region and these are kind of we'll

339
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,240
go we're going to go into some of these

340
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,338
in just a moment some of the kind of big

341
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,419
Landscapes that we may think of in the

342
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,860
northeastern part of the United States

343
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,958
for example we think of our hardwood

344
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,820
forest as being our predominant biome if

345
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,199
we went to the Midwest we would think of

346
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,778
what historically would be the Great

347
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,360
Plains as being another biome so big

348
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,799
kind of character you know the way the

349
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,500
floras grow the way they actually look

350
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,078
is the major kind of driver of this or

351
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,120
the way we describe it

352
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,620
um and

353
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,519
I'm going to go through a couple here so

354
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,200
we're going to start off with the

355
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,539
Savannah Biome this is found in the

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,740
north eastern part of the country and

357
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:08,278
these are areas that tend to be

358
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,839
dominated by a lot of grass and few

359
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:11,939
trees this is the area where you'll find

360
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,620
the beginning of The Baobab trees that

361
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,300
will continue some of the world's most

362
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,820
widest trees that you find that will

363
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,319
continue up into

364
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,700
subtropical and tropical Africa and

365
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,139
these are the Landscapes that support

366
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,120
the large mammals and that that uh

367
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,379
are major drivers of the ecology and

368
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,379
this land landscape here

369
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,578
the next kind of biome we stepped into a

370
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,078
very big one now is the forest biome the

371
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:38,879
forest biome is a very interesting biome

372
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,439
it's it's the smallest I think it's less

373
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,639
than a percent of the total biomes in

374
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,839
that map I showed you before you didn't

375
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,579
probably even notice it because they're

376
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,959
so small and this biome is very

377
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:49,019
interesting because it is a biome that

378
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,179
receives most of the most of the the

379
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,740
biomes are in South Africa are either

380
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,620
dictated by summer rainfall or winter

381
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,120
rainfall and that is a major definer of

382
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,278
the kind of plants that tend to grow in

383
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,700
these areas in the forest biomes they

384
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:05,039
receive rainfall all year round and that

385
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,980
is because they're on just along the

386
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,179
south coast of South Africa and what's

387
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,399
interesting about this biome is it's

388
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,259
very very concentrated and unfortunately

389
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,879
with the lights it's hard to make this

390
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,379
out what's interesting about this

391
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,899
picture here is saying it's a very kind

392
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,700
of

393
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,740
compressed where these forests actually

394
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,060
grow so this is along the South Coast as

395
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,259
you're kind of going north here and

396
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,359
pretty much where this picture cuts off

397
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,679
right here you end up in fine boss biome

398
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,419
so it goes from kind of shrubby

399
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,099
grasslands and then you come in down

400
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,240
here and you're in this this forested

401
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,060
area and you can actually see this

402
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,519
contrast right here this little bit here

403
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,399
is actually uh fine boss and then and

404
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,379
then Forest immediately stops off these

405
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,360
Cliffs so it's a it's a relatively small

406
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,578
biome but a very interesting one it's

407
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,980
where we tend to find obviously the Big

408
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:52,138
Trees things like the putter cup put a

409
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,139
carpus vulcatus or the yellow wood which

410
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,060
are some of their giant trees protocarps

411
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,680
are interesting some interesting

412
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:02,578
lineages in themselves having relations

413
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:05,039
to Flora in Australia or or New Zealand

414
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,439
and some large disjunctions there I put

415
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,360
this other picture up of tricocletus

416
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,459
cranatus it's related to the witch hazel

417
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,919
family which we may know from our local

418
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,859
Flora here and kind of one of the few

419
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,958
that is that is present both in in our

420
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,959
Flora as well as South Africa's

421
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,399
another major biome is the Kuru biome

422
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,079
and this is the kind of areas that

423
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,078
support a lot of this really interesting

424
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:34,198
succulent plant biodiversity they tend

425
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,659
to get winter rainfall and have

426
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:39,359
a lot of these interesting succulent

427
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:41,819
characteristics cam adaptation and do

428
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,440
interesting things like like grow as you

429
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,060
can see in this picture here they're

430
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
little kind of items that are just

431
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,659
eeking out in existence just between

432
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,759
these rocks where they're not going to

433
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,679
be exposed to direct sun and have their

434
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,139
root systems dry out

435
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,198
we tend to find a lot of biodiversity

436
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,879
here in in aloes or this near endemic

437
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,919
family Azo ACA

438
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,179
with things like the drosanthemums and

439
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,179
the conifitums as well

440
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,940
and last but not least on our on our

441
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:13,620
tour of biomes is the fine boss biome

442
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,120
and I think the fine boss biome is what

443
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,740
most people think about when when they

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,839
talk about South Africa it's the kind of

445
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,240
the concept that comes to mind and what

446
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,880
this biome is kind of looks like is you

447
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,198
have lots of restios lots of grass like

448
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,059
plants that we can kind of see on the

449
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,179
slide on the right and then on the left

450
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,379
this is kind of a more typical we see

451
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,939
proteas in the background but it's a

452
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,240
shrubby landscape it never gets a much

453
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,279
above three meters in height and this is

454
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,139
where we tend to find the highest amount

455
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,379
of our biodiversity and our highest

456
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,778
amount of engineism in our plants

457
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,600
just a few more images of what you may

458
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:51,778
find supports a large

459
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,519
bulb Flora as well

460
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,078
and just a few more pictures here for

461
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,179
for contacts you can see on this middle

462
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,099
picture here just the the size of this

463
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,278
of this flower head of this uh

464
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,600
proteus syneroides

465
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,459
so I've kind of walked people now

466
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,620
starting from a global scale we step

467
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,660
down to a more a more localized scale by

468
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,578
thinking about biomes and then the the

469
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,660
finest scale well pretty much the finest

470
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,599
scale that we're going to get into here

471
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,360
is vegetation maps and a vegetation map

472
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,000
is a way of defining your flora-based

473
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,099
based on more of the the species level

474
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,179
and more of the general level and what I

475
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,399
kind of want to point out just here in

476
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,439
this picture is that um you know as we

477
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,780
look at the northeastern part of the

478
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,779
country we're still seeing pretty large

479
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,000
swatches of a different color or swaths

480
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,220
of different color sorry of solid colors

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,798
but as we get down to the western part

482
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,538
we just see it it looks like someone

483
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,980
took paint and just like smacked it all

484
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:45,200
over the place we're seeing a lot of a

485
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,400
lot of different

486
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,798
interactions between all these different

487
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,240
specific vegetation types and so each of

488
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,519
these patches is big enough to be able

489
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,160
to Define them broadly by relationships

490
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,200
or likenesses between species in general

491
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,740
but even within that we see that we have

492
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,380
tons of tons of different vegetation

493
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,000
types going on and just a quick thing to

494
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,500
point out here

495
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,779
this is pretty much we're looking at the

496
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,519
fine boss regions in this area and this

497
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,079
is more of the succulent crew and these

498
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,538
are the main areas the Western Cape is

499
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,939
really the main areas where we find

500
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:20,819
these high levels of speciation uh

501
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,279
occurring Within These these families so

502
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,678
just another blow up of this area we can

503
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,058
see that uh it's it's on the coast this

504
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,580
is an area that primarily receives

505
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:31,798
winter rainfall and the the mountain

506
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:34,918
ranges here going both north to south

507
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:38,058
and east to west are major definers of

508
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,059
this kind of landscape

509
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,798
so the Western Cape as I've probably

510
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,500
hammered into everyone's head at this

511
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,240
point is highly diverse but it's hot

512
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,279
it's not just highly diverse one of the

513
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,200
things that make it very unique is you

514
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,599
have this high level of endonism and

515
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,880
that's why when you look at the

516
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,219
floristic kingdoms on a broad scale this

517
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,620
area really shows up so one out of five

518
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,660
families 20 of the families in in the

519
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,599
Western Cape are endemic and on a

520
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,940
species level up to 70 of species are

521
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,558
endemic and so what that means again is

522
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,740
plants that are occurring in just one

523
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,019
location but even in most cases a short

524
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,538
distance away you won't you'll find

525
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,220
maybe related species but not the same

526
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:21,839
ones

527
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,640
and so again it comes back to the

528
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,220
question of of why is this actually

529
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,679
happening and uh it's not an easy

530
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,779
question to answer oh sorry I got ahead

531
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,280
of myself here uh sorry the so the other

532
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,200
thing that defines the Western Cape

533
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,139
region other uh Flora there other than

534
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,500
the highest levels of of of endonism is

535
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,980
also uh what one botanist described as

536
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,619
the effect of excessive speciation uh

537
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,980
and the the most striking example of

538
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,599
this is is the genus Erica uh it's known

539
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,660
to grow in other parts of the world as

540
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,899
well but in South Africa out of the 860

541
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,080
species that are known globally 730 of

542
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,140
those occur just within this one small

543
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:06,178
area and there's other large examples of

544
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,299
this such as the geraniums the

545
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,740
pelargoniums or gladiolus or axolis

546
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,960
other plants that people in this room

547
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,779
may be familiar with having species

548
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,440
numbers that are high above 100

549
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:22,918
just found in the Western Cape

550
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,360
so again the question is why why is this

551
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,340
why is this happening and what are some

552
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,798
of the kind of major drivers that are

553
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:31,500
causing these this kind of speciation to

554
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,359
occur and there's three or four that I'm

555
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
going to present right now the first one

556
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,899
as I pointed out in the picture

557
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,779
previously was these mountain ranges are

558
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,860
very important part of the of the

559
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,798
landscape

560
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,500
uh in the Western Cape and the the main

561
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,440
hypothesis or Theory here is that these

562
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,859
topographically complex regions uh act

563
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,220
as Ice uh as barriers causing isolation

564
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,659
of plants within them so you may have a

565
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,298
plant that has distributed to a certain

566
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,860
extent and then for from changes in the

567
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:04,500
landscape or just over time there's not

568
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:06,839
gene flow is not able to move back and

569
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,099
you end up having speciation events that

570
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,720
therefore

571
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,459
cause some of these patterns that we're

572
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,900
seeing

573
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,900
a few more images of the

574
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:18,379
Topography of the Western Cape

575
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,740
the next is the adafik the the soil

576
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,720
properties of the region and and this

577
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,220
has been described as kind of a mosaic

578
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,380
if you looked at a soil survey map of

579
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,200
the Western Cape where you have in in

580
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,940
very close proximity to each other very

581
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
different soil types and the main Theory

582
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,140
here goes is that you're going to have

583
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,919
sister species that are related to each

584
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,679
other

585
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,840
but in different soils will have

586
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,900
speciated and

587
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:52,019
formed new ones as being the next kind

588
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,759
of major driver and the thing I I'm

589
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,259
sorry to scale back the other thing

590
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,480
about the um

591
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,819
the the mountain ranges the the other

592
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,980
major driver here that is important is

593
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,139
that in these mountain regions uh it's

594
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,960
considered to have a long period of

595
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,520
climatic stability and that is a you

596
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,600
know one thing you hear oftentimes cited

597
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,119
and

598
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,279
uh in some of the botany literature is

599
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,538
that these long regions tend to drive

600
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,538
speciation as well

601
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,620
and then the the last major major dryer

602
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,000
driver is fire adaptation this is

603
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,158
actually an image that was taken just

604
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,319
last Wednesday in the Western Cape

605
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,080
region in an area that's known as

606
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,538
silvermine and this is as it was kind of

607
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,259
burning and burning in full Forest this

608
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:38,400
is uh about a day later looks like

609
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,259
absolute moonscape

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,120
and uh like I said this just happened

611
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,919
last week and here's a picture of the

612
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,219
same region when I was out there in in

613
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,100
December so complete transformation

614
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,600
but but most importantly what this main

615
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,579
kind of the theory that goes behind this

616
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,859
are the plant's abilities and their

617
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,359
adaptations to deal with fire and the

618
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:59,219
main two different adaptations that you

619
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,439
tend to find are on one hand the

620
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,940
re-sprouters the ones who are root

621
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,220
systems are not completely destroyed by

622
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,019
these by these events but actually have

623
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,000
the ability to sprout up once again or

624
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:13,259
the receipters the plants that actually

625
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,319
need fire to act as scarification

626
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:19,919
or also just remove competition

627
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,720
to occur and the the uh the idea here is

628
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,659
that you tend to have sister species

629
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,640
that have different fire adaptations uh

630
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,200
So based on one of the other you have

631
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,200
this speciation events that occur

632
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,360
So based on kind of all these different

633
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,038
things I thought maybe South Africa

634
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,959
might be an interesting place to go and

635
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,000
have a look at plants and to study the

636
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,279
Flora and and to help out a little bit

637
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,960
so I put an application for the Drear to

638
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:48,960
work at Stellenbosch Botanical Gardens

639
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,240
and uh just experience this remarkable

640
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,159
Flora

641
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,038
and so to give people a background on

642
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,200
Stellenbosch it is the oldest university

643
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,140
Botanic Garden in Africa who was

644
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,779
originally established in 1902 primarily

645
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,700
for as a teaching Garden about 20 years

646
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,038
later it moved to the the location that

647
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,919
it's at now and early on they had a big

648
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,538
focus on succulent plants as I showed

649
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,179
that picture of the postcard before by

650
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,519
Hans Hera he was the first curator and

651
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,798
did a lot of work with this near endemic

652
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,619
family Azo ACA as well as some of these

653
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,538
other things like like well whichia and

654
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,699
at Stellenbosch the garden was

655
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:29,339
originally based off the uh the garden

656
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,038
design at Padova the world's oldest

657
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,918
Botanic Garden in Italy but over time it

658
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:37,140
has is changed

659
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,840
and Stellenbosch is in a pretty

660
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,120
interesting uh position and I'll kind of

661
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,740
go on I'll talk a little bit more about

662
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,599
this and when I talk about some of the

663
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,558
national Botanic Gardens but one of the

664
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,939
things that actually makes them stand

665
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,619
out and this may seem like a funny thing

666
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,659
since I just went on and on about how

667
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:53,519
interesting the floor of South Africa is

668
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,320
is that is that they actually grow

669
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,119
exotic plants they grow plants that

670
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,319
aren't from South Africa they do grow a

671
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,579
lot of plants that are from South Africa

672
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,619
particularly for their conservation

673
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,240
program but what this actually does is

674
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,279
it really creates an opportunity to

675
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,980
engage the public and to draw them into

676
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,940
the garden because uh you know for you

677
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,980
know someone like most people in the

678
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,000
room or myself you go to South Africa

679
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,200
because you want to see the floor you

680
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,058
want to see the fine boss you want to

681
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,519
see these these families that are just

682
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:18,839
totally you know different than what

683
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,579
we're used to but when you grow up

684
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,439
around that you may not actually realize

685
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:24,899
that what you have around you is so

686
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,179
spectacular unless you you know have

687
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,679
opportunities to engage with it so one

688
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,000
of the unique places that Stellenbosch

689
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,298
is actually at is that they can grow

690
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,579
things like Victoria lilies or strongly

691
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,220
load on the Jade fine or even do they

692
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,199
have Bonsai collections which which draw

693
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,579
people in and engage them with the

694
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,860
plants and the landscape in a different

695
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:46,319
way than uh some of the other Gardens in

696
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:48,719
South Africa can do

697
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,639
uh they support the educational mission

698
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,240
of the university and they do this

699
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,220
through labs and practicals as well as

700
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,038
collaboration with researchers the

701
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,740
example down here is they Stellenbosch

702
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,720
houses the living collection for Oxalis

703
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,579
this is one of those

704
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,519
Genera that I mentioned before has more

705
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:09,899
than 100 species in it and they they

706
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,700
maintain the living collection so that

707
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,159
the taxonomists are working on it on the

708
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,120
University can use it as part of their

709
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,440
research

710
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,519
and there's a really good relationship

711
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,519
for for both of them

712
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:24,960
Stellenbosch being a botanic garden they

713
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,880
they keep they have a plant record

714
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,759
system and they use the iris BG system

715
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,740
uh they're they're

716
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,359
as of right now some of the national

717
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,679
Botanic Gardens have also gone on board

718
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,418
finally but they're actually

719
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,679
Stellenbosch was the first Garden to

720
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,179
have a comprehensive plant record

721
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,919
keeping system and this is one of those

722
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,778
things that um you know most people kind

723
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,620
of maybe not think about playing records

724
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:45,599
all the time but it's one of those

725
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:47,819
things that makes a botanic garden

726
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,219
different than just a park the fact that

727
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,798
we that every plant that comes into the

728
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,298
collection is is labeled is numbered we

729
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,339
can keep up with the taxonomy we can

730
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,679
take images of it if it's wild collected

731
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:00,058
we'll take GPS points and and then

732
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,798
therefore you know that when you bring

733
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,058
that plant into your collection it's not

734
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,639
just something interesting to look at

735
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:08,099
but it also is a representative of that

736
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,140
population from the wild it brings a lot

737
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:11,519
more value to your collections and also

738
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,038
assist in things like when you're

739
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,019
actively involved in plant conservation

740
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,058
programs

741
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:20,158
they also run a

742
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:22,019
plant conservation program as I was just

743
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,059
kind of going on about these are the

744
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,379
three species that they focused on I'm

745
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,940
not going to talk in too much detail

746
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,380
about this but this was one of the

747
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,400
primary things that I worked on while I

748
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,559
was down there

749
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,320
this is a deceptive pointed out this is

750
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,700
a dresser origia it's it's a sundew they

751
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,500
grow around here as well but there's a

752
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,819
lot of diversity down there it's one of

753
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
the biggest in the world they're

754
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:43,558
carnivorous plants

755
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,538
um and this is a hat for scale but you

756
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,418
can just see the massive length of these

757
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:50,460
leaves and just a among carnivorous

758
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:52,080
plant Growers this plant has has gained

759
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,220
a lot of attention because it is just so

760
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,220
so weird

761
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:01,200
and uh last but not least uh

762
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,399
Stellenbosch botanic garden is another

763
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,140
one of its strengths and other things

764
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,480
that makes it stand out is that it is

765
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,278
not part of the national botanic garden

766
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,140
system it's a small garden there's only

767
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,200
eight permanent staff it's affiliation

768
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,880
with the university allows it to take on

769
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,400
initiatives and to kind of be very

770
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,960
Nimble and they may not have as much

771
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,360
capital or resources of some of the

772
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,220
bigger Gardens to focus on projects but

773
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,558
their small size allows them to make

774
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,558
kind of meaningful small impacts

775
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,620
and so my main goals I'm just gonna go

776
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:33,058
over there as well I was in the juror

777
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,979
experience was to go work at stonebosh

778
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,339
Buchanan Garden but it was to develop my

779
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,599
my field botany skills and some you know

780
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,759
I'm in the Horticulture Department some

781
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,798
person may ask why should you develop

782
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,480
why should you work on field bonding and

783
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,099
particularly in Botanic Gardens which I

784
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,440
hope to continue in once I graduate here

785
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:51,778
and I've worked in the past this line

786
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,440
between between botany and Horticulture

787
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:57,419
is is not not so well defined a lot of

788
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,460
the plants that we come to appreciate in

789
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,559
this day and age either as ornamental

790
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,019
plants obviously at some place at some

791
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,759
point came from the wild and Botanic

792
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,158
Gardens for a long time have had a very

793
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,019
active role in plant exploration and

794
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,179
also bring plants into cultivation so

795
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,759
then we can use them and various

796
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,220
different types of ways

797
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:20,179
it was also to help out in this plant

798
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,179
conservation program

799
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,899
it was also a reciprocal agreement so in

800
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,419
order to give some expertise and some

801
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,979
training to the Garden itself so I

802
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,380
helped out in doing I did a lot of work

803
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,720
on the plant records as well as getting

804
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,520
in and doing Horticultural work but also

805
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,319
did training I've got a background in

806
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,700
erebora culture so doing some work with

807
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,859
some of the staff and learning how to

808
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,440
tree climb how to do proper chainsaw

809
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,819
safety use

810
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,558
and a couple of these other kind of

811
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:48,058
skill sets that they didn't necessarily

812
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,038
have down there

813
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:52,319
and then last but not least was to gain

814
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,058
experience in Botanical Gardens and not

815
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,619
just at Stellenbosch but also with a

816
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:57,720
number of the other Botanic Gardens that

817
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:59,939
I interacted with while I was in South

818
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,460
Africa learning about how they conduct

819
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,038
Horticulture in this with these Special

820
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,058
plants that they grow there and also to

821
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,740
learn about how they manage their

822
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,058
Gardens and what their General approach

823
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,519
is and just kind of learning about the

824
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,798
management of how this is all done

825
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,839
and while I was down there I also had an

826
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:17,220
opportunity to have a look around pretty

827
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,839
much all the pictures that we've seen so

828
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,120
far are pictures that I've taken with

829
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:22,558
the exception of a few so this is just

830
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,699
an illustrator this is not all the

831
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,839
places that I went but this is just

832
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,058
illustrations of some of the natural

833
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,558
areas and Botanic Gardens kind of across

834
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:32,000
the country that I had opportunities to

835
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,000
visit and interact with

836
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,759
so for the last kind of part of my talk

837
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,278
I'm just going to talk about the state

838
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,720
of biodiversity in South Africa as well

839
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:41,460
as a little bit how plant conservation

840
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,200
is actually conducted since that was the

841
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,200
main kind of focus of my work down there

842
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,000
and

843
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,798
uh the the state of the biodiversity in

844
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,079
South Africa as I've kind of described

845
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,298
before is very fascinating uh but is

846
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,519
also very challenged

847
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:00,839
um one of the challenges that we have in

848
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,879
terms of figuring out how to do

849
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,819
effective plant conservation work is

850
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,500
that uh we still just don't know people

851
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:09,538
still just don't know with 30 000

852
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,038
species occurring across all of South

853
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:13,200
Africa people just don't even know what

854
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,119
the full extent of the Flora is so the

855
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,640
Flora is far from complete uh new

856
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,558
species are found all the time since

857
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,960
2009 there's been more than 300 new

858
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,879
species described and the the rate of

859
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,700
discovery cannot be kept up with the

860
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,980
expertise of taxonomists either in South

861
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,440
Africa or

862
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,179
um or or abroad since there's experts in

863
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,179
these groups kind of all over the place

864
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:39,960
many of the threats to biodiversity the

865
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,778
three main biggest ones are ones that we

866
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,880
are familiar with the loss of habitat

867
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:45,960
alien species species Invasion as we can

868
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,600
see

869
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,079
appear just marching these are the

870
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:54,719
Western Cape region just having

871
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:57,119
Fort Jackson march cross invasive tree

872
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,679
just march across the landscape as well

873
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,599
as a large one is unethical plant

874
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,679
collecting this isn't a picture from the

875
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,359
field this is actually a picture of

876
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,480
kirstenbosch botanic garden where people

877
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,579
actually came in at night and somehow

878
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,798
stole cycads directly out of their

879
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:15,500
collection which is

880
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,500
an amazing feat but really unfortunate

881
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,959
so

882
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:21,418
I'm going to go over some of the major

883
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,220
players in the way that the way that

884
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,320
um plant conservation is actually

885
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,700
conducted in South Africa and as I

886
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,500
mentioned before the national Botanic

887
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,240
Gardens are our major player in this and

888
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,759
they fall under the the purview of

889
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,038
what's known as the South African

890
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,658
National biodiversity Institute or Sandy

891
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,099
and sambi is a large blanket

892
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,200
organization they are a government

893
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,879
organization that primarily covers all

894
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,019
biological research that goes on across

895
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,179
the country so you could be have

896
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:46,940
entomologist ornithologists marine

897
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,320
biologists

898
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,580
botanists and so on and so on that are

899
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,519
under this

900
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:55,619
since they are very large it is they

901
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,359
they have a lot of resources and you can

902
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:58,918
make large impacts but as I was kind of

903
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,839
describing before they may not be the

904
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,880
most Nimble and be able to take quick

905
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,879
action which sometimes is necessary

906
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,860
and samby oversees the national Botanic

907
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,259
Gardens across all of South Africa there

908
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:16,019
are there's 10 a 10th has just recently

909
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,640
been added

910
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,819
and the national Botanic Gardens are

911
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,860
very interesting institutions they have

912
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:24,418
a strict mandate to only grow native

913
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,099
plants and this is kind of getting to

914
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,720
the point of what makes Stellenbosch a

915
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:28,980
little bit different and this is and

916
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,600
this is a wonderful mandate to have

917
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,278
because with so much biodiversity down

918
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:33,839
there it's important to have folks that

919
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,179
are that are really focusing on working

920
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,740
on these groups that don't grow anywhere

921
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,840
else and also to learn how to display

922
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,700
them and get the the public generally

923
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,278
engage with them so these are mostly

924
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,899
pictures all taken at kirstenbosch

925
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:47,579
Botanic Garden

926
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,319
another interesting thing about the

927
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:50,939
national botanic garden is they all have

928
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,740
contiguous natural areas that are

929
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,820
attached to them so as you can see from

930
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,558
both these pictures here there's

931
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,538
formalized landscapes in the front the

932
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:59,339
picture on the right is table mounting

933
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,740
off into the background that continues

934
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:03,959
off into Cape Town or a leopards Cliff

935
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,159
here on the sorry this that's on the

936
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,620
right hand picture

937
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,599
the left hand is the kirstenbosch and

938
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:12,239
these natural areas are managed they

939
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,200
they go on and make sure invasive plants

940
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,418
aren't coming in they do population

941
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,118
counts of species in there and it's just

942
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:20,279
a continuous part of the garden and the

943
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,780
garden experience which is a very

944
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,460
interesting this is this is a model that

945
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,320
actually Cornell plantations uses as

946
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,059
well they may not be contiguous but

947
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,820
plantations also manages lots of natural

948
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,838
areas and it seems like it makes sense

949
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,159
especially if you want to do plant

950
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:33,539
conservation work but it's actually

951
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,519
something that's fairly unique there's

952
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:37,320
not a lot of gardens out there that do

953
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,980
just kind of have this kind of dual role

954
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,500
of natural lands management as well as

955
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:46,918
cultivated landscapes

956
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,079
the national Botanic Gardens house the

957
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,000
herbarium and they have departments that

958
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,539
are work to do the work mostly on the

959
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,398
systematics and taxonomy of describe

960
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,019
actually describing the Flora of South

961
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,299
Africa

962
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,579
and they also like I mentioned have

963
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,200
developed Horticultural expertise in

964
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:08,119
figuring out how to actually grow a lot

965
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:10,618
of these types of plants and they they

966
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,880
put this out to the general public in a

967
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,160
number of different ways these are

968
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,338
examples of books of how to grow a lot

969
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,199
of these specific Genera or families of

970
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:20,820
plants that may be unknown to most

971
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,338
people and they've also had the ability

972
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,800
to to prioritize learning the

973
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:26,820
Horticultural

974
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,200
practices that are necessary to keep

975
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,760
these things alive so this is an example

976
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,460
of the succulent collection at crew

977
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,960
National botanic garden and

978
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,039
and and getting to talk to the

979
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,420
horticulturalists and the people that

980
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,099
actually work with these plants is very

981
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,519
very fascinating because the the amount

982
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:42,838
of nuance that they've developed and how

983
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,300
to take care of a lot of these really

984
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,799
interesting taxa is uh is quite

985
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
extensive and it's great that they that

986
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,400
they have it they're putting books out

987
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,839
they're they're creating a medium by

988
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,200
which they can express this to the rest

989
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,199
of the world

990
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,119
but the national Botanic Gardens aren't

991
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,280
the only players in town there also are

992
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,440
other other folks who get involved so

993
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,060
this is an example of a partnership with

994
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,099
industry and a group that I was able to

995
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,838
spend some time with the cape Institute

996
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,420
of micro propagation they primarily

997
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,219
focus on diesel orchids the genus of

998
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,680
orchids these are a couple pictures of

999
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:18,019
disa uniflora probably South Africa's

1000
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,059
most famous

1001
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:22,739
Orchid but but they're a private

1002
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,099
organization that also does conservation

1003
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:28,618
work so what that means is they go out

1004
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,640
to the field they they're involved they

1005
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,800
will

1006
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,440
do plant surveys the GPS where actually

1007
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,000
they find these plants they'll pollinate

1008
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,820
take capsules bring them back figure out

1009
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,679
how to get them into into culture grow

1010
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,300
them on and then they'll do different

1011
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,739
things with them depending on what

1012
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,359
species they are if there's an

1013
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,578
ornamental interest in them they'll

1014
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,139
figure out ways to continue these these

1015
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,660
plants in culture and then send them

1016
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:53,519
internationally abroad to make some

1017
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:55,559
money for the organization but then they

1018
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,719
also will go back out and do replant

1019
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,159
reintroductions the cape Institute of

1020
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:01,980
micro propagation also worked with

1021
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:04,460
Stellenbosch and on disa barbata which

1022
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,139
is one of them has one of the smallest

1023
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,780
populations of any disa and they're

1024
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:12,900
doing repopulations using these kind of

1025
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,260
methods and protocols

1026
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,720
you also tend to find conservation being

1027
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,520
conducted in places like private Gardens

1028
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,078
uh in in lots of in the part of South

1029
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,559
Africa that I was in there's lots of

1030
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,060
Estates and and Vineyards

1031
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,400
that are kind of a major part of the

1032
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,539
Horticultural trade in general but one

1033
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,539
of the interesting Partnerships that

1034
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:35,519
you'll you'll find is is some of these

1035
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:38,039
Gardens actually being active in plant

1036
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,719
conservation and so the example of this

1037
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,599
is the Silver Tree here on the right

1038
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,819
leucodendron Argentia was known to be

1039
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,800
kind of have one main population on

1040
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,900
Table Mountain that over the years has

1041
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,060
kind of declined kirstenbosch has been

1042
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,680
active in maintaining that but the only

1043
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,480
other known population a disjunct

1044
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,379
population was also found and these

1045
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,599
aren't these aren't the best pictures

1046
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,099
but this is very close to uh

1047
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,420
Stellenbosch the town that I was in

1048
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,099
these these mountain ranges that are in

1049
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,659
the background this the rustenburg wine

1050
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,579
estate goes pretty much right up to this

1051
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:07,379
mountain slope and on these slopes they

1052
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:10,440
found a second population of this

1053
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,820
leucodendron argentium and not because

1054
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,960
they have to because they want to and

1055
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,760
they're interested in conservation they

1056
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,079
actually go out they remove invasive

1057
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,060
plants and they monitor these

1058
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,039
populations and try to keep them

1059
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,039
straight thriving as well

1060
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,820
there's also a big citizen science

1061
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,780
initiative and and people who are just

1062
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,760
generally interested in plant

1063
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,339
conservation in South Africa and this is

1064
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,440
one organized example of that known as

1065
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:36,659
crew custodians of the rare and

1066
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,280
endangered wildflowers and these are

1067
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,098
folks who are

1068
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,079
uh they're mostly retired but they're a

1069
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,059
volunteer group that well it's based by

1070
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,119
region they'll identify natural areas

1071
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:49,739
within their region that um haven't been

1072
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,358
surveyed and they'll coordinate with

1073
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:52,919
samby and they'll go out and they'll

1074
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,659
actually do these surveys where they

1075
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,700
actually see what's going on out there

1076
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:57,960
they'll keep population counts uh and

1077
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:01,319
they'll and then they'll submit that so

1078
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,240
they can be used for for consensus

1079
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,280
across the whole country

1080
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,939
another example of this

1081
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,640
um

1082
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,159
is a program known as ispot ispot is an

1083
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,379
application you can get for your phone

1084
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,819
and what it is is if you are out

1085
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,140
buttonizing doesn't matter if you're

1086
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,880
just walking around you're on your your

1087
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:19,440
farm you're on your land and you see a

1088
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,240
plant that you don't know is of interest

1089
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,220
to you you can take a picture of it you

1090
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,259
can post it up on I spot either attempt

1091
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:27,539
to identify yourself or it will alert

1092
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,820
experts and they'll come in and take a

1093
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,559
look at these plants and identify them

1094
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,880
and this is a great way of kind of you

1095
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,440
know doing quick surveying on the ground

1096
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,079
but what's been interesting about it is

1097
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,338
as more and more people have been using

1098
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,260
this program that there's actually been

1099
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:41,578
a whole handful of species that have

1100
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,099
actually been discovered because of this

1101
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,660
process and this is an example of one

1102
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,880
that we saw I saw one of the flower

1103
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:50,159
shows where

1104
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,240
folks actually someone just took a

1105
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,759
picture of this and went out to the

1106
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:55,139
expert they they didn't know what it is

1107
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,900
they came and they did the field work

1108
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,639
they they were able to describe it find

1109
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,838
it Define it and therefore it was

1110
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,838
introduced as a new species

1111
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,960
so

1112
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,940
um kind of getting towards the end of

1113
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,559
the talk here why does it all matter

1114
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,300
we've described how there's so much

1115
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,219
biodiversity in South Africa and a lot

1116
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,460
of it is is kind of under threat and and

1117
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:18,959
this is the same challenge that plant

1118
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,480
conservationists Focus have everywhere

1119
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,358
in um South African itself about roughly

1120
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,119
25 of the Flora is either threatened or

1121
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:28,739
of conservation concern

1122
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,900
um but

1123
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:32,939
the kind of point I want to make here is

1124
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,559
is that you know we all know that plant

1125
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,000
conservation or any kind of conservation

1126
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,099
is a very important activity to

1127
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,079
undertake and instead of focusing on

1128
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:41,400
what the sheer numbers are here through

1129
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,660
many of the examples that I've shared

1130
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,519
with you before I think more of the

1131
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:46,679
point is that is that there's a lot of

1132
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,159
interested parties and an interesting

1133
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,899
collaborations that are being conducted

1134
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:54,899
that really really look to address these

1135
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,400
problems on multiple levels uh and I

1136
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,579
think that was a really interesting and

1137
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,980
Powerful finding for for me to have and

1138
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:04,079
uh just just in general it's not just

1139
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,760
that in on a Global Perspective that the

1140
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,680
plants that we all

1141
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,839
um you know are threatened or in Peril

1142
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,559
but but there's also

1143
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,659
um

1144
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,880
I've been a restriction in

1145
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:17,460
in the education

1146
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,780
of how to actually you know conduct some

1147
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,699
of this work so these are two articles

1148
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,060
that came out just this last week in

1149
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:25,858
popular media uh one is talking about

1150
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:27,599
is talking about collections

1151
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,759
specifically and the value that those

1152
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,400
hold and the other one is talking about

1153
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,320
field biology skills and how fewer and

1154
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,838
fewer folks are actually being trained

1155
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,338
in these fields so we have issue you

1156
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,500
know we have challenges in conservation

1157
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:43,500
not just on the plant side but also in

1158
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,960
our education system and

1159
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,338
I think my last kind of point is that is

1160
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,960
that even though again we have these

1161
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,578
challenges I think it's more of a point

1162
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,740
of optimism that we still have places

1163
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,140
like educational institutions

1164
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:56,639
universities and Botanic Gardens which

1165
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:58,618
are able to pull all this information

1166
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,960
together and since I've been given this

1167
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:03,180
perspective from the side of botanic

1168
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,940
gardens these institutions really stand

1169
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:09,239
out as being places that can do this

1170
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,679
work not only on a theoretical level but

1171
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,358
actually can get out there and do the

1172
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,460
applied work and they can bring all

1173
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:16,980
their resources they have to bear to to

1174
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,599
this Mission so not just monitoring

1175
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,280
these plants in the population in the

1176
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,539
wild and monitoring populations but

1177
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,880
actually developing Horticultural

1178
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,858
protocols how to do institution exitu

1179
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,140
conservation how to document the floor

1180
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,380
of our world and follow up with the kind

1181
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:33,659
of research that is that is important to

1182
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,358
allow plant conservation to happen

1183
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:37,799
and so that's kind of it so with that

1184
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:39,480
I'd like to thank the Horticulture

1185
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,740

1186
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,539
committee for allowing me to have this

1187
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:44,338
kind of experience there's a lot of

1188
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:45,539
Direction this talk could have gone and

1189
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:47,578
went in a lot of different ways anyway

1190
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:48,960
so if you have questions please please

1191
