1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:06,839
University

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,268
[Applause]

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,189
I'd like to start out by introducing the

5
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:25,500
people in my group that are actively

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,820
have actually been working with health

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,609
diseases I'll tell you what I think

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,948
about when diseases but I'd like to

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,558
first of all Jamie Cummings is here to

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,239
admit with with life program for a

11
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,128
number of years it's now with the IPM

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,280
program what kind of got us started on

13
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:44,988
some of our network Kevin you raise your

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,658
hand there Kevin Myers and and now

15
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:51,179
gemstar is my research and extension

16
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:54,149
support that specialists so what I'd

17
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:56,429
really like you to know is when you're

18
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,149
out in your hemp fields and you're

19
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:01,618
finding things you think may be diseases

20
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,679
if you notice something say something

21
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:09,978
let us know get in contact with one of

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:15,509
us and we'd like to diagnose the problem

23
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:18,900
like any other new crop there are paths

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,480
insects weeds diseases that will be

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,180
a problem in the production of that crop

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,689
and of course this is the second year

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,910
out with this new crop in New York State

28
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:33,539
unless you go way back and it might have

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,390
been grown previously but in recent

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,130
history it's it's all new to us and that

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,099
includes the plant pathologists that are

32
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,469
working on this so with our one care of

33
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:47,369
experience last year under our belt we

34
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:49,920
saw a dozen different microbial

35
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,040
organisms that we found that cause

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,500
disease on em and these vary everything

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,469
from things that cause of rotting and

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,079
the root system that affect a seedling

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,118
establishment on the ground to things

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,569
that cause a lot of fungi they caused

41
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:10,860
spots on leaves lighting on leaves and

42
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:14,340
then we saw things also in the in the

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,060
bucks and the hats the flower parts and

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,530
sees very often we found something we

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:26,069
would call rain mole Petridis a fumble

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,319
investing the buzz but why alert are the

47
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,579
messages that most of the industrial

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,269
government we've seen has been pretty

49
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,800
damn healthy as you may know and you're

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,710
gonna hear more about today there are

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,040
different classes and uses of industrial

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,830
hemp from the CBD pipes this is a drain

53
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,780
pipes to the to the fiber pipes etc

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,000
you're gonna hear about that so there's

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,800
a lot of different genetics out there in

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,330
these fields and I'm sure delivery and

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,939
others are going to talk about that but

58
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,920
that means there's a lot of diversity in

59
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,020
the crop that brings about the

60
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,809
corresponding diversity and the microbes

61
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,650
that cause disease so we definitely seen

62
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,629
in some of the CBD pipes or of

63
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,480
susceptibility to some of the leaf spot

64
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,969
pathogens for instance so I'm not going

65
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,409
to try to clutter your minds with a lot

66
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:18,659
of Latin names of microbes today but

67
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:20,609
again what I'd like to leave you knowing

68
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,990
is that we're we're trying to get an

69
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,940
early handle on these things eventually

70
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:30,000
what we'd like to see

71
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,560
to try to fix election and these

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,729
different classes where he's doing

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,800
reading and see if we can't increase the

74
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,199
level of natural genetic disease

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,680
resistance which would be our first line

76
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,560
of defense I think you're all aware you

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,960
will hear from others here today that

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,289
because of its its status as a

79
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,250
non-profit elite at this point there

80
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:59,219
there are amount of the fifth row

81
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,050
labeled materials or control pests and

82
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,030
that includes diseases even things like

83
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,040
seat treatments that outlets going to

84
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,500
talk a little bit more about but

85
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,479
eventually we hope as the classification

86
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,400
of this tropical slaw from the federal

87
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,250
government they've got to keep up with

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,459
what's not at the state level that we

89
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,930
will be starting to look at different

90
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,660
kinds of nuts management materials

91
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,560
including synthetic chemicals is what

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,750
well

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,439
and a group of group materials organic

94
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,680
production right now the best thing we

95
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,870
can do is is start out with some sound

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,870
cultural practices and I think you'll

97
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,060
hear this over and over again today

98
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,668
rotation is the greatest friend there's

99
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,759
less likely to be disease in fact if you

100
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:52,560
grow in the sequence fairly unrelated

101
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,918
crops so emptying a broad leaf

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,839
probably it's best rotational crop

103
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,399
partners would be things like small

104
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,239
grain cereals and corn

105
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:06,049
the grasses of monocots we have some

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,910
commonality in some of the pests

107
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,189
especially across other broadleaf crops

108
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,650
we're going to learn more about that as

109
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:16,410
we go but one of the biggest problems we

110
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:18,418
have is white mole than anybody that

111
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,600
grow soybeans or vegetables is well

112
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,189
acquainted with and so a rotation with

113
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,860
white beans or some of the more

114
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:30,269
susceptible vegetable crops is probably

115
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,080
not not the greatest choice because of

116
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,389
the susceptibility

117
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,209
at all and we're learning other

118
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,918
connections like that a lot of the

119
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,469
disease organisms some of the couple

120
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:45,609
leaves month are very specific for a

121
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,650
particular species of plant and so it's

122
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,250
not so much of a problem therefore

123
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:53,829
additional sequence and perhaps looking

124
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,250
at variation in the bride's and both of

125
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,348
ours

126
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,959
of the double that some are going to be

127
00:05:56,348 --> 00:06:00,969
more susceptible develop itself as they

128
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,419
go along and working with Larry this

129
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,480
program I think they're underwater

130
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,280
more about cytosol again my message to

131
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,069
you here today is if you see something

132
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,959
that appears that might be disease worth

133
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,939
the business of diagnosing that it's

134
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:23,169
trying to get a handle on what luck they

135
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:27,069
work with it so thank you requested your

136
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,069
learning presence for Garrett

137
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:34,810
[Music]

138
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,629
okay so we have we have a laboratory is

139
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,800
depakote and I know you've got maybe we

140
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,629
put that under weapon

141
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,180
that might be the easiest thing as we've

142
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,129
is what the diagnosis of plant diseases

143
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:51,019
we can put that on the website

144
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:56,199
otherwise why why email you see b3 at

145
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:56,198
Cornell dot edu but look I think that

146
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:05,729
or he'll have website competitive baqara

147
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,449
2 today

148
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,450
yes sir

149
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:19,829
you know the question here is we have a

150
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,750
listing of varieties and by diseases of

151
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:24,719
our relatives susceptibilities and quite

152
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,730
honestly we're so thoroughly into that

153
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,860
cycle of trying to understand that that

154
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,230
we kind of have a shopping list the

155
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,600
things we have seen but the partition

156
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,840
about that finally we're not there

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,150
either

158
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,409
and of course this is a very dry form

159
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:43,469
shortly part of the growing season we'll

160
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,330
see how that ends up but there up to

161
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,570
this point and the growing seasons there

162
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:51,509
has not been an intense these diseases

163
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:55,310
we have very hard to find any at all so

164
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:58,680
good offense but last year we can't walk

165
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,860
22 different pathogens as far as which

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,610
ones we're going

167
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:07,350
severe that still is where there's not

168
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,930
really an extensive swollen

169
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,379
so we're very much a narrative learning

170
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,379
over here

171
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,978
I think this thing is hot

172
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:30,219
so question presents a good ones about

173
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,639
that we excused any kind of exhibitors

174
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,729
natural products whatever their soil by

175
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,139
home itself the short answer is no I

176
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,110
think there's a lot of possibilities

177
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:43,718
there but with the learning curve we're

178
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,509
we're here somewhere

179
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,580
both are some of our aspirations as we

180
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:51,278
move the walk with us and I might point

181
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,950
out it is I'm sure Larry will that we're

182
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,649
not in this by ourselves there are 35

183
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,950
other states with EF so the question was

184
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,570
referring to connecting with State

185
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,440
Department of Environmental Conservation

186
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,440
which

187
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:23,509
there are any of these disease control

188
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,730
materials so even before it got the

189
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:27,379
state regulatory book there's nothing

190
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,740
allowed now there are some things that

191
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:32,740
are on the grass lipstick are used or

192
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,000
maybe he'll talk

193
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,829
that but there are some materials that

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,350
might be useful in certain things but in

195
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:51,600
general we don't really have any tool

196
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,600
or disease or insect all different

197
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,110
okay maybe we talk about that whole

198
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:14,109
label - thank you

if anybody just raise your hand if you

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,160
smell like they have a

202
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:48,649
so my face here at the instrument

station

204
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:54,818
used to say that right now is repenting

205
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,620
of the New York State extra recitation

206
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:57,909
for the past

207
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,039
right there so here

208
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:05,689
by my areas exceed Science and

209
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,799
Technology so I my nature of my program

210
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,160
but also my health

and

214
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,399
there's really what if it

215
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,829
where there's many see challenges and it

216
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:27,370
is really a new crop this is Jerry

217
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,959
talked about in his presentation some

218
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,899
things we kind of respect there's

219
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,479
something

220
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,330
ever work that you can touch up somebody

221
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,149
else work really

222
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:42,629
so we're really trying to establish some

223
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:45,299
roads now science that science that

224
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:47,820
can be translated into outrage of

extension to veterinary or edible

community it's the kind of product we

227
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,150
get here if we look at the 24:15

228
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,019
department bill and allow the space to

229
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:02,919
go ahead and

230
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:05,980
research might startle states have done

231
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,289
this newer competitiveness and a big way

232
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,800
last year an even bigger weight this

233
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:11,379
year

234
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,250
I contacted Andean market we're looking

235
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,669
at 30

236
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,879
there's a temple Atlanta tea are wrong

237
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,689
here in New York State this side of the

238
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,629
Mississippi

239
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,120
major states Kentucky North Carolina and

240
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,789
then you go to the mountain state of

241
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,110
Colorado the largest in Oregon and the

242
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:34,899
west coast so services of substantial

243
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,909
industry yeah we also learned a lot from

244
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,240
other countries in particular our

245
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:42,610
neighbors to the north Canada has over

246
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,490
110,000 acres of more mature canary

247
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,940
they're very can rely on four seed

248
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:52,419
companies for getting my materials as

249
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,700
far as seed sources so in your picture

250
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:56,919
probably already been growing you can't

251
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,200
we know what the seats look like if you

252
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,719
actually put a seed on top of the park

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,850
just about the actual size of the seat

254
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,778
this is just one of the commercial life

255
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:10,220
that was used to death of it last

256
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:14,778
and some of the harbor primer trials

257
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,970
home angel and we did not adulterate the

258
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:20,809
part of their on the left this is this a

259
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,759
huge range of sizes and if you working

260
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:24,409
with any of the trucks if you work with

261
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,800
the bill crops and vegetable products

262
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:29,519
you know the same company

263
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:32,250
much better job of sorting seats by size

264
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,709
so that's kind of the first thing is is

265
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,778
it reveal if you break their shape see

266
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:39,419
we've done not working those small

267
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:42,208
secret really just produce run plants

268
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:46,289
are really just really kind of just bear

269
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:49,079
part of seat count but they do

270
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:51,480
and it started out with those losses my

271
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,210
goal and working in the areas with this

272
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,360
program is we're trying to be proactive

273
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:01,230
and looking at C treatments for the

274
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,320
future in 2018 marvelous to look at that

275
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:07,139
one it all goes well and should be

276
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,879
exempted of the DBA which is really

277
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,460
going to open up on floodgate we're

278
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,100
having kids being drawn just as in any

279
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,259
of their vegetables or feels rough so

280
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,230
there were also of pesticides

281
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,840
we're trying to be proactive instead of

282
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,820
looking ahead though it's been working

283
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,970
the best more special economic scenario

284
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,510
it was a higher more higher one works

285
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,610
with university partners and others the

286
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:36,929
registration of the turtles both

287
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:39,649
chemical and biological organism and so

288
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:39,649
higher worry

289
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,699
there's a foreground now at NC State

290
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,409
I mean weed control and so we're kind of

291
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:49,508
trying to get our foot in the door for

292
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:54,938
the next year for 2019

293
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:58,990
so the so one part of that is decided by

294
00:14:54,938 --> 00:15:00,969
chemical or pesticide is how we gonna

295
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,180
fight it so my laboratory does a lot

296
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,740
better so these are kind of a story that

297
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:07,808
can definitely bring them

298
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,089
yeah we're getting to the tariff on the

299
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:10,990
speed the power would you see a lot of

300
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,649
uniformity

301
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,659
so if transmitted some time of upgrading

302
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:19,419
the c-section okay so now we can see

303
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:21,409
whether the property has a difference

304
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:24,659
we could get a very uniform

305
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:24,659
[Music]

306
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,659
again kind of working to try to

307
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,990
establish ourselves with a higher war

308
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,990
work with that

309
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:39,610
many years again looking at chemicals a

310
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:42,189
treatments for diseases but also to like

311
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,409
as mild pesticides would you be organic

312
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,140
material so that's kind of a next year's

313
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,519
presentation so I got suspended looking

314
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,338
at

315
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,419
we're going to change ears accountancy

316
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,130
testing see quality has been

317
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,219
standardized testing procedures are in

318
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:03,159
place they've been in place Romania

319
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,970
other products ain't using a ball

320
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,829
contest

321
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,519
we're looking at two samples of

322
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,860
amphitheater for example with 23 C

323
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,949
models that are being used with steel

324
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,690
coils this year and my laboratory did

325
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,690
about the germination and the purity of

326
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:27,580
the level very poor germination lack of

327
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:30,129
uniformity and the farmer turned out

328
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,820
pretty well but this is no la mole from

329
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:35,559
things like that so there can't be

330
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,500
actually internal as well warning

331
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:43,179
pathogens oflife diseases within disease

332
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:46,240
and there's been a kind of a need for

333
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:48,849
having effective secret in control there

334
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
what we'd like to do is have the looks

335
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,070
like revolt health on the right hand

336
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:57,219
side with very good a warm seat Lee

337
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,870
termination potential okay so let's go

338
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:05,889
over to the second page of that

339
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,888
and there are RNA oscillation

340
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:14,379
for the US Ernie has minimal sandwich

341
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,378
standards for what the few months

342
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:20,279
termination

343
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,279
middle of donations

344
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,500
other aspects of security

345
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:41,949
so inert material broken see other

346
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,460
other proxies can be present we see any

347
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,580
of those would distress from having

348
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:52,150
purity so and there are already

349
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:54,939
thresholds down with them so what we're

350
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:58,300
looking at here are those 23 siva hi

351
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,299
Frank those high to low germination and

352
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,690
you can see work on both the board as

353
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:07,029
far as determination to percentages

354
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:12,910
those determinations again using 80% of

355
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:15,460
the threshold percent sea level would

356
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:18,580
even have certification status to these

357
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,860
planet diseases now I have a few other

358
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:24,308
areas over here that are highlighted in

359
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:27,339
red on the purity side so again the

360
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:29,950
other prophecies exceeds the

361
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:33,220
certification standards other other

362
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:36,080
wheat seeds own presence so if we just

363
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,630
took these p5 destructors

364
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:42,559
we'd only have a little over 40% of the

365
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,970
cidade could even pass so this industry

366
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,970
which is somewhat benefit

367
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:52,899
raise itself up just to put itself to

368
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,740
help to make certification standards so

369
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,910
that's kind of like

370
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:02,359
here is the equality can be good look at

371
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:06,679
this time a 34c and if you have other

372
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:09,139
prophecies in our material we see that

373
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,750
when you open up that factor see there

374
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,679
there that is really something to see

375
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,859
companies can easily clean out with see

376
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,350
conditioning equipment so we really need

377
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:25,329
to have really improved speed line to

378
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:25,329
really improve and Estelle

379
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,769
so this type of is it opens up anybody

380
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:33,869
else question and accomplish your

381
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,629
purposes because some of you are CPD

382
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:40,169
people this these all these varieties

383
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:45,059
are for fiber or per frame we've not

384
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:50,389
done that we have that CBD right

385
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:53,960
but I just want to talk another big job

386
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:53,959
yes sir you have a

387
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:16,160
okay so basically what are our standards

388
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:19,600
that we use so there is official

389
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,169
standards for seat testing adopted by a

390
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,750
company let's say

391
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:26,020
associate efficiency they'll it's the

392
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,089
same technical criteria as our safety

393
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:32,720
laboratory would use in Albany as well

394
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:34,699
as other states so there are criteria as

395
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,950
far as that's the journalist receiver

396
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,929
does the duration of the tough things

397
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,230
like that so we're really four five

398
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:44,059
right in prescribed methods that were

399
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,190
following is Marit of what these

400
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:48,680
determinations and the period of Death

401
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,730
Star are chemicals

402
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:54,778
we work

403
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,778
basically there

404
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,259
[Music]

405
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:11,808
Marcus

406
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,800
particularly because that was asking

407
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,799
about irrelevant

408
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,600
about what what seek treatment so Islam

409
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:27,599
and

410
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,009
when I would call in today does

411
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:40,208
we may have or next season as early as I

412
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:41,978
see some very optimistic that we have

413
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:44,859
some of these in appear houses already

414
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:47,828
used by the field club so be more of a

415
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:50,108
steep treatment rather than don't think

416
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,750
of like a Steve melon and things like

417
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:55,730
that we're really just look

418
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,730
small aperture

419
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,180
the organic grower

420
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:22,039
you to those where they where the

421
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,990
chemical type secret which would be just

422
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,720
for our conventional cyclo production

423
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,599
just the way it is in prophecy but again

424
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,120
it's the time we got to hit the 2018

425
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,000
marvelous but I have

426
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,939
where campus exempted that will open

427
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,759
things up so again what Gary and I are

428
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,320
trying to strategize is try to be

429
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,129
proactive Pentagon

430
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,599
this year what is 10 the night seed and

431
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,470
how are they doing it like networking

432
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:54,009
right for those of you involved in CPD

433
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,620
production there

434
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,058
you have an option and depends on what

435
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,959
the seed companies define it as

436
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:02,319
feminized seeds

437
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,558
what are feminized seeds basically is

438
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,928
you want to have the plants that you're

439
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:10,480
producing only to produce a flower

440
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:14,230
you should not want to help those

441
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,628
produce male flowers hemp seeds are

442
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,058
naturally what we told iishe this means

443
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:22,148
they have there's there's male plants

444
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:23,888
and female plants what we want they're

445
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:25,839
just the flower production where the

446
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:29,798
secret these productions be the highest

447
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:32,519
is those that only produce female

448
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:36,058
flowers so as they progress

449
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:39,210
so what a feminized seat part of that is

450
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:41,970
is a particular method that needs to be

451
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,860
done during the steep production to

452
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,950
produce those feminized seeds

453
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,359
where are you using different materials

454
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:52,730
silver material things like they have to

455
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,959
change the sex expression so basically

456
00:23:52,730 --> 00:24:00,000
think of it our own kind of our

457
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:03,870
chromosomes with xx and XY campus is is

458
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,170
the same type of a plant species with XX

459
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:10,529
being female XY being male so basically

460
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:12,420
is you need to have XX knowledge to

461
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,889
produce the seeds to produce the

462
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,690
feminized seeds oh it's a rather

463
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,000
specialized the companies that these

464
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,799
seeds are extremely expensive those of

465
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,990
you working in it maybe a dollar or so

466
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:26,200
per seat so it's an expensive type of

467
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,710
but one that you would have that high

468
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,409
level of very very high level of female

469
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:36,340
plants the other way is is if you do not

470
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:38,919
have that or if this procedure is during

471
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:40,629
seed production still issue some males

472
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,538
those males are really going to have to

473
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:46,720
be broke out during the C production

474
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:53,140
time during the crop production time so

475
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:57,519
you do not have that source yeah Larry

476
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:00,759
you wanted to jump in here move on okay

477
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,230
oh yeah I just want to say that some of

478
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,200
the grant funding that we happen to be

479
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:09,778
overstating facilitate certified seed

480
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:14,319
production seats are a big issue because

481
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:17,140
federally still considers it illegal to

482
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:19,349
move live seat across state lines so

483
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,950
that was a strong disincentive for

484
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:25,019
to invest to see production when it is

485
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,750
definitely illegal without the cell

486
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:30,150
across state lines

487
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,099
now the Omnibus spending act included

488
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,740
language that said that the federal

489
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:38,308
government have not extended any funds

490
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:42,029
to intercept that movement but the TGA

491
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:43,759
still considers it illegal so when

492
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:48,240
companies are doing their due diligence

493
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:53,250
their lawyers tell them so it has been a

494
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:56,880
challenge for us to see companies that

495
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,558
overcome that barrier but he also said

496
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,740
that New York State is not necessarily

497
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:07,740
the best environment so when those

498
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,788
restrictions are lifted we may well see

499
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,788
an intensification of C production in

500
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:17,269
those states at that optimum Playa

501
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:17,269
Tori's disease

502
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:23,679
so it's another disincentive for New

503
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,069
York seed companies to produce material

504
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,890
all that being said we were we had a

505
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:31,809
company committed to producing certified

506
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,150
seed here Indigo state covers

507
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,980
International hoc solutions was

508
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,960
committed to produce surf club seat of

509
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,029
yellow chassis one of our best health

510
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:45,220
department and last year unfortunately

511
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:47,579
it took us any more than eight weeks to

512
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,579
get that

513
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:51,399
[Music]

514
00:26:53,109 --> 00:27:02,269
took us human Annette months to get to

515
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:04,909
see important the first and sanitary

516
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:07,940
certificate a second time he's coming

517
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,769
right there up the computers multi so

518
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,279
that seat is now sitting in our freezer

519
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:18,400
here and the vertebral here so next year

520
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,399
we should have certified

521
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:27,929
[Music]

522
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,029
so so the question is are there

523
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,310
companies that are producing seed in

524
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:34,259
your state no there are no companies

525
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:38,190
right now producing seeds within New

526
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:42,150
York State near say Agra markets has

527
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:44,359
adopted the chaos certification

528
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:47,970
standards

529
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:52,878
certified 86 so we now have more time

530
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:58,608
for surprises even putting a label on MC

531
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:58,608
by next year we will have surprises

532
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,418
required

533
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,298
there is another report to do surprising

534
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,170
Oh

535
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,058
all

536
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,299
so at Cornell University we do not work

537
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:26,910
on marijuana so no we're not medical

538
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:30,240
marijuana

539
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm gonna back it up to six weenies and

540
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,910
answer some of your questions and give

541
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,910
and hope you

542
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:43,589
my name is

543
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:52,420
how many secretary I see how many here

544
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,810
are not currently involved in the

545
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,810
program

546
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,740
so

547
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,109
I don't think I need to run through the

548
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,519
entire process as y'all are talking

549
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:07,949
afterward water views just too great

550
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,629
synopsis right now as I mentioned

551
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:13,860
previously we have about 3,200 acres

552
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,450
could be planted in New York state

553
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,789
approves the planting if everyone

554
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:21,019
doesn't approve planted to them to the

555
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,019
extent that they apply

556
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,650
because this is a research project we

557
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:56,400
have a lot of CPP applications come in

558
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,500
in the past in the first few years this

559
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,710
year particularly so we have stopped

560
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,160
taking CBD applications to allow us to

561
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:08,610
get a handle on the CBD world and to

562
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:14,480
better that is establish guidelines for

563
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:17,069
or regulating CBD we are as I said we

564
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,679
are still taking applications for

565
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:23,720
growers however given the lateness of

566
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,720
the season it would probably be a viable

567
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,819
the wait until later applied because it

568
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:32,429
is a three-year purpose so he wouldn't

569
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,319
want to waste her to birthing and not be

570
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:37,200
able to anything

571
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:39,689
this year with regard to getting to see

572
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,369
as many of you might know if you want to

573
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,399
get seats from the internet and source

574
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:46,408
you have to come to us we hold the DJ

575
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,089
import permit you would submit your

576
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:50,159
request through wise you make all these

577
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:52,319
arrangements with your seed company just

578
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,320
a minute request a la sweeden file the

579
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,808
dv8 paperwork they send us the import

580
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,898
permits you then get them to do to the

581
00:30:57,808 --> 00:31:03,538
seat company and your seat has to come

582
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:05,189
to always we'd have to take possession

583
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:08,519
of it you have to come pick it up in

584
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:11,730
Albany we try to get around this we ask

585
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:17,519
that you allow us to be serviced at

586
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:19,980
farms and we got a pinko so that just is

587
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,358
the way it is for now as also as

588
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,019
mentioned earlier there is pending

589
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:27,509
couple legislation federal farm bill if

590
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:29,399
the particle passes that this is a big

591
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:32,249
unit with the language that's included

592
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:34,498
in the Senate version this program is

593
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:37,618
likely to change quite a bit and that we

594
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:39,419
may not be required to make you submit a

595
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:41,308
research question to us it would take it

596
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,259
out of the realm of research it would

597
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:46,349
treat it more like a regular

598
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,650
agricultural crop however you would

599
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:49,869
still have to come through us

600
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,030
we will still be regulated in fact that

601
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:55,029
the law passes as written we will have

602
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:57,220
to submit our program to the federal

603
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:59,859
government for their approval and then

604
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,269
we would be run through the guidelines

605
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:05,979
that are approved by the federal level

606
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:07,930
so there are still some changes to be

607
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,630
made in the future we think with regard

608
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,759
to how the program is wrought perhaps it

609
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,520
will require less on your part with

610
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,650
regard to coming up in the research over

611
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,329
it but it will still be regulated you

612
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,240
still likely have to come out on the

613
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:24,970
test to ensure that the THC levels are

614
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,019
but they the definition of industrial

615
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:30,069
health so having said all that I know

616
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:32,619
usually whatever I have one of these

617
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:34,178
events there's lots of questions that

618
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,909
could take a lots of times I don't want

619
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:41,190
to bore you with more stuff about the

620
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:41,190
process and just a feeling

621
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,620
[Music]

622
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:52,109
and the question is is there a fixed

623
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:53,849
rate from CPD licenses right now that is

624
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:55,889
not a fixed rate we have just not been

625
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:57,449
able to take decision was made that

626
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,140
we're not going to take any more of the

627
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,850
diabetes

628
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,370
we expect that sometime in the future

629
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:03,959
that we will forget did you see do you

630
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:08,129
have what diction to get power no

631
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,910
there's not sure what us will be we

632
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,910
don't we don't know

633
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,230
I have I don't think it would be years

634
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,230
but

635
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,038
you know about

636
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,330
No

637
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,150
I do not know the rule but this is this

638
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:39,220
is in part the question is do I know the

639
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,070
regulations with regard to shipping CPT

640
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,190
office over state lines in teacher form

641
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:48,159
or other like that this is where some of

642
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,019
the issues lies with with regard to CPT

643
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,540
production and the question of legality

644
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:55,569
and we always advise people that they

645
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:58,180
need to get a good lawyer lawyer network

646
00:33:55,569 --> 00:34:00,609
on campus issues this environment is

647
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,730
changing rapidly the DJ I'm sorry the

648
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:07,689
FDA recently approved alcohol have a

649
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:10,269
dialect for the treatment of seizures in

650
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,400
epileptic children and CBT is a major

651
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:14,590
component of that which says now which

652
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,539
now means that CBD perhaps will be

653
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:21,430
looked at differently by the federal

654
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:23,050
government so we need to we need to see

655
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,279
what the proper to do with the power

656
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,280
regulation CBD

657
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,210
the processing grant algorithm is run

658
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,480
through Empire State Development it's a

659
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:43,418
different agency I do know that they

660
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,190
they did stop taking the allocations for

661
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,769
the faculty I'm not sure whether that

662
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,240
will open up but I think once again it

663
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:51,759
was because many of those applications

664
00:34:49,239 --> 00:35:00,609
were related to CBD I think you think of

665
00:34:51,760 --> 00:35:03,220
a better handle on TV we haven't yet got

666
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:05,829
a it's a would be out of 32 hundred or

667
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:07,689
so and we're not yet sure how many look

668
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:10,449
at it we're seeing the process of having

669
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,429
our horticulture inspectors go out to

670
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:15,309
ground truth what actually was to land

671
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:16,869
it and of course he'll be back up at

672
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:19,369
harvest time to take the samples that

673
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:22,259
you will be tested

674
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,759
[Music]

675
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,530
and

676
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,689
falling power

677
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,689
[Music]

678
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:37,799
I don't I don't know off the top of my

679
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,800
head to basket or disappear

680
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,710
[Music]

681
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,779
that's an excellent question last thing

682
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,869
is how do they sell CBD flowers in a

683
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,130
sort of Geneva that is not within our

684
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:57,779
program that's not within our purview

685
00:35:53,130 --> 00:36:03,150
and that is a function of lack of

686
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:05,660
clarity with regard to the CBD a lack of

687
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,660
branches

688
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:16,979
the question was that I talk more about

689
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,858
how the state program will take that the

690
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:23,159
farm bill passes it will require that we

691
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:25,318
will submit our program to the federal

692
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,940
government for their approval

693
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:31,849
it would also receive either side would

694
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,798
take a hospital have out of the world

695
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:37,380
control substance we predicted that's

696
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:40,108
highly regulated federal side but it

697
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,599
would they would still require us to do

698
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:45,358
sampling testing to ensure that the THC

699
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,999
levels work forward as a definition and

700
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,679
there were there was no longer States

701
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,449
invisibly they would no longer be a

702
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,358
requirement than to be a research

703
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:57,210
project and the restrictions with regard

704
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,788
to commercialization with no longer be

705
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:03,318
there some of it right now through

706
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:07,369
commercialization important to pedal is

707
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,369
allowed potato

708
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:11,748
that's what I understand yeah we just

709
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,069
don't have that handle on it because we

710
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:15,918
would still have to go where everything

711
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:23,869
is growing and we need to sample it

712
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:25,668
that's okay the question is are the

713
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:28,429
research license renewable right that's

714
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:30,768
the research authorization it's good for

715
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:34,789
three years it's a $500 a permit to you

716
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:36,048
and then if your research project is not

717
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,630
completed at the end of the three years

718
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:40,159
you can apply to us birth extension we

719
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:43,329
haven't yet have that happen because we

720
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,328
haven't have this is a guest

721
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,090
[Music]

722
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:53,318
the question is that the $500 fee

723
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:56,460
remains is saying that the department

724
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:56,460
has I don't know

725
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,619
if the question is if the part milk is

726
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,260
not that's what we see is what we're

727
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:10,150
doing now I don't think so I think that

728
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,100
we are pretty well on the road could be

729
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,139
an exhaustive Penn State I believe that

730
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:16,319
we would continue to work under the

731
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,319
curve

732
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,989
that's a tough question it would be

733
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,519
might ever be my best guess let's assume

734
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:32,539
there would be a continuation of the

735
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:32,539
existing in marijuana

736
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:38,719
question is if marijuana is legalized in

737
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:42,139
the state now without the programs would

738
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:45,439
be two very distinct and discrete

739
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:47,269
operations there it has been workgroup

740
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,200
warm by the governor's office to address

741
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:54,559
the development of an adult use

742
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:57,559
marijuana program we're not sure where

743
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,320
there might be overlap there may be some

744
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:04,309
in the CBD world we don't we don't know

745
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,380
that that I think that workgroup today

746
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,650
we first

747
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:16,690
so very much in the formative stages

748
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:16,690
[Music]

749
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,210
the question is are we still checking

750
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:27,969
THC level of the profits being wrong for

751
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,769
the for fiber grant yes we are because

752
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:33,659
the potential is there that a good go

753
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:33,659
hot and you wouldn't

754
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,849
[Music]

755
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:44,849
it would be wrong next year for the 2020

756
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:09,829
the only the only see the question is if

757
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:11,599
the seat was purchased in New York State

758
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:13,369
would still have to be picked up in our

759
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,960
office and all day the only time that

760
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,150
anyone needs to come to get to their

761
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,909
seat and all that is if it's even been

762
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,490
imported from another country pursuant

763
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:28,329
to our DEA import permit and that's

764
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:28,329
going to exact

765
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:37,058
that's because there is some gray area

766
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:38,889
with regard to federal law and various

767
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,569
what would enforce when authorities that

768
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:43,868
can make me the locked away on a trip

769
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:47,558
from Colorado Illinois Karissa

770
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:50,740
there is no prisoner so when I mentioned

771
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:54,579
that it is illegal to move across state

772
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:57,189
lines but that federal agencies could

773
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:59,589
not expend money to intercept death that

774
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,730
does not preclude the local law

775
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:02,730
enforcement agencies

776
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,360
yeah well I've been ignoring the side

777
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:21,579
this is an area

778
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:24,129
the question is if you're growing your

779
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,349
CPD and you've done your extraction

780
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,960
problem well you've drawn their CBD from

781
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:31,269
the sample by our inspectors and testify

782
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,269
our lab and it's within the 0.3%

783
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:35,829
but then through the extraction process

784
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:39,730
you can come out with a product that is

785
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:43,269
above 0.3% is that something that needs

786
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,369
to be destroyed or and be diluted that

787
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,690
is an excellent question and there's

788
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,639
something that we are still trying to

789
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,889
get a handle on and it is part of the

790
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,109
reason why we were no longer at this

791
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:57,219
point making the CBD application because

792
00:41:53,110 --> 00:42:00,039
it you know if it's about point 3 THC

793
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:06,309
you're not within the parameters of the

794
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:09,250
industrial hemp over there so I think

795
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:12,849
well Vermont may be at 1% but they might

796
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:14,710
go on road you know we aren't where we

797
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:16,210
are compelled to the stick that

798
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,849
established by the federal law and state

799
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,980
law passed and so there are other states

800
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:25,860
that are taking a different approach but

801
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,860
you know we're here you have to do

802
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:42,670
the question is do I know how many acres

803
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:44,530
out of the 3200 are dedicated to CBD I

804
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:48,639
don't know the number of acres but I

805
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:50,170
know that out of the first 100

806
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:54,009
applications we've got this growing

807
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:57,300
season 50 of the more CBD so it's 50% at

808
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:00,550
that time we'd have been you know taking

809
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,589
fortify recommendations continuously

810
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,150
funded it's a it's a high percentage

811
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:06,150
that are receiving

812
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:20,189
whether taxing or financial aspect

813
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:26,469
channel me

814
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:34,669
right the question is is there a tax

815
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,858
taxation element to the growing or the

816
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,200
proofing of the CBD products or any of

817
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:41,659
these duster level and melter is that we

818
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,789
do not have any anything like that in

819
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:46,159
our agencies you know were strictly the

820
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:50,320
exercise a Bigfoot there are not one

821
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,319
special tax programs associated

822
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,860
based on

823
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,280
same whole

824
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:23,298
so the question is about as from a

825
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,679
grower perspective I tend to optimize

826
00:44:23,298 --> 00:44:29,358
direction of CBD

827
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:32,630
while maintaining legal limits on the

828
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:37,188
THC so that's an excellent question

829
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:39,079
stress and induce that pathway we don't

830
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:41,328
have a lot of experience here at Cornell

831
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,469
and studying that but we do have two

832
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:47,719
trials now underway to start to quantify

833
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:50,110
CBD and THC production across a range of

834
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:53,608
different parts

835
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:58,108
this month we'll be talking about that

836
00:44:53,608 --> 00:45:02,009
and then also developmental stage is

837
00:44:58,108 --> 00:45:04,208
purple crossdress canoes

838
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:08,228
so all of these things are critical

839
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:10,808
questions to address and all of these

840
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:13,958
require quick turnaround the test pit

841
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:18,249
box which we also do not have any other

842
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:21,338
state so there is a regulatory testing

843
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:23,858
that will be done in food lab at Agra

844
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:26,168
markets but many of you always want

845
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:28,298
we're gonna turn around tests for THC in

846
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:30,458
the middle of the season so you can

847
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:35,278
judge when you should service so that

848
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:35,278
you don't go out so there is a urgent

849
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:44,048
intercept one more question for

850
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:46,689
attendance and that question is are you

851
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:49,329
accepting applications for affiliated

852
00:45:46,688 --> 00:45:54,339
growers or CBD production from existing

853
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:57,039
license or no

854
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:04,470
so existing CBD license holders did not

855
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:04,469
expand Christmas

856
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:12,139
okay I just want to thank him again this

857
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:14,599
has been an incredible partnership and

858
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:17,929
collaboration with active markets and

859
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,599
the legislature maggot Marcus has never

860
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:23,179
turned down a request that I hope to

861
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:28,669
comment speak to a public group like

862
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:32,389
this they have been very open in working

863
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:36,799
with us wanting to develop a program

864
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:39,369
based on science which I

865
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,170
we're grateful

866
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:45,248
Thanks

867
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,249
[Applause]

868
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:52,429
so a lot of those questions that folks

869
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:56,650
were asking are very challenging in our

870
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:59,839
current legal landscape I serve on the

871
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:01,670
industrial hemp working group remain by

872
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,950
the commissioner of agriculture my farm

873
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:05,950
partner who's here also serves them

874
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,450
other folks here on the working group

875
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:13,980
but when the governor accepted the

876
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:20,039
report from the commissioner of health

877
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:22,429
for proposing adult abuse marijuana here

878
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:22,429
and

879
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:30,558
decriminalization of marijuana that

880
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:33,259
proposed particular challenges or the

881
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,950
industrial hemp industry right so if

882
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,079
you're growing for CBD in particular if

883
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:42,078
your plants go up they're considered

884
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:44,450
marijuana so perhaps we'll be better off

885
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,019
if your CBD producer getting the

886
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:50,298
marijuana grower twice but we don't know

887
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:52,159
what that program will look like whether

888
00:47:50,298 --> 00:47:55,900
we will have outdoor marijuana

889
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:59,509
production and whether how that will

890
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:02,269
interact with our existing medical

891
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:05,450
marijuana program so those are very

892
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:07,940
challenging questions and again the

893
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,649
state has been very prudent and rolling

894
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,329
out these programs and I

895
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:14,440
believe that they're doing it against

896
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:17,930
ice with putting the brakes on the CP

897
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,028
direction right now until we can work

898
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:23,298
out the gold standard for regulation

899
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:24,018
here at the opposition so we're going to

900
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:26,748
move on

901
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:28,778
Jamie Crawford from selling fine this

902
00:48:26,748 --> 00:48:33,189
program is going to talk about our

903
00:48:28,778 --> 00:48:33,190
cohort trials and

904
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:52,010
so we had our trials well last year we

905
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,010
have the second

906
00:48:53,269 --> 00:49:01,440
hopefully it's level again that finances

907
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:03,300
if any of you folks are growing

908
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,909
varieties that you don't have even on

909
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,039
this list these let us know because I

910
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:11,399
would be really interested to know if

911
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:13,289
there are green or fiber varieties in

912
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,160
New York this year that we haven't been

913
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:19,199
tested it would be really interesting

914
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:22,589
so from these lists you can see we've

915
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:27,299
got varieties from Canada from Serbia

916
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:33,320
from Ukraine from Italy from Poland all

917
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,320
those up from Oregon these developed

918
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:40,049
countries are pretty interesting when

919
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:43,710
the market started to expand there was

920
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:46,320
sort of a variety grabbed European

921
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:48,869
varieties so United States companies

922
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,840
have that line of exclusive rights to a

923
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:54,818
lot here began types so one thing that

924
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,278
we do have in our trials is high

925
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:59,288
so we have a say father the viagra that

926
00:49:57,278 --> 00:50:01,380
we purchased last year that we saved the

927
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:02,960
seed from and that was produced in

928
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,050
Poland and

929
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,940
we have tiger that was producing

930
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,289
Kentucky's last growing zuman's we're

931
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,599
going to have those to do next to each

932
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:15,529
other and are we really interesting to

933
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:19,250
see what the differences are in any just

934
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:22,700
because of where the seed was grown so

935
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:25,190
we divided all of our trees up into

936
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:27,230
three trials this year we have a fiber

937
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:29,960
trial that's pretty straightforward

938
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:32,000
but then we have a grain cultivar trial

939
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:37,699
and what we're calling dual purpose and

940
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,710
those were those are divided by time to

941
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:43,909
maturity so based on the information

942
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:46,429
given to us from the seed companies and

943
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:48,829
anything that was a hundred and ten days

944
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:53,239
to maturity or less went into the grain

945
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:58,159
trial and then more than ten days way to

946
00:50:53,239 --> 00:51:00,500
the dual purpose trials I'm so sad that

947
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:03,108
you guys aren't able to see the variety

948
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,210
trials because I think that really

949
00:51:03,108 --> 00:51:08,719
highlights the importance of regional

950
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:11,059
testing for the varieties because we

951
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:14,118
have two varieties in our grain trial

952
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:17,599
that are not flowering yet everything

953
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:20,930
else is about knee height and starting

954
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:23,930
to seventies and those two guys are

955
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:26,899
still not flowering and then in our new

956
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:28,230
purpose trial we have three or four

957
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,700
varieties

958
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:35,190
that are also starting to set these well

959
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:36,929
the revenue and that was all just based

960
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:40,650
on information given to enter from the

961
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:42,480
seed company so yeah so that's a

962
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:46,440
highlight to have a part at the regional

963
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,679
testing is so this year we've got six

964
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,420
different locations there are trials so

965
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,139
the front you guys can see the back

966
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,750
[Music]

967
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:58,150
some of the trial in one Island this

968
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:01,449
year so we'll have submitted for me for

969
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:04,420
that or also have two locations here in

970
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:06,969
Geneva 1 and if the guff and then one on

971
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:09,309
artwork and the Creepo Park so for all

972
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:12,039
the organic growers of America provides

973
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:15,190
information about atmosphere and then

974
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:17,559
the last trial at the Chaney's so just

975
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:20,800
about as far north as you can get and

976
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:23,759
still be in New York State so that'll be

977
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,170
a totally some good information to

978
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,240
people that we've worked with again and

979
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,059
I have pulled us two varieties that are

980
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:34,029
eight feet tall in Canada for about my

981
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:36,549
three feet tall here so maybe we'll get

982
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:42,700
a little bit more height in our shady

983
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:45,580
trial and we do here or in locations so

984
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:50,469
our first try with planted last year

985
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:54,549
what and we planted it to ignite - that

986
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:56,679
was our first trial last year I it was

987
00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:01,090
exceptional it was an exceptional

988
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:03,849
planting this year everything that we

989
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:06,650
planted wasn't within two weeks of that

990
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:09,528
eight but

991
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:11,930
the establishment wasn't it episode I

992
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:13,400
mean you guys know right it was right we

993
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:18,858
had a riot

994
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:20,539
and after I early July here and we went

995
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:22,429
and we took notes and because this

996
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:27,460
comparing this year's in it to last

997
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:30,379
year's we had its to peace in difficult

998
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,119
trial is planted in the field directly

999
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,480
next door to the [ __ ] planted last

1000
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:38,769
year so everything should be the same

1001
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,769
with 94 days later

1002
00:53:39,769 --> 00:53:47,369
but the height on advocacy that tryouts

1003
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:49,649
to be shorter than air at that last year

1004
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:53,609
and that's because we can't have the

1005
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:55,320
rain that we had last year so if the

1006
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:57,240
first month so the first four weeks

1007
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,250
after planting we have less than two

1008
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,368
inches and

1009
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:08,420
and last year we had closer to 5 inches

1010
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:16,608
so it was a really taking so I brought I

1011
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:20,059
brought the plant so this is a plant

1012
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:22,009
from our fiber child last year and it

1013
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:25,219
was actually taller you can see the top

1014
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:27,320
of it broke off we're not going to get

1015
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,879
fiber yield like that this year it's

1016
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:33,740
just not going to happen because

1017
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:37,099
everything is so much shorter I have I

1018
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:41,379
have a competent cigar rhenium it will

1019
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:44,900
be very good some pots filled in nicely

1020
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:47,059
but our fiber because of the drought is

1021
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:51,769
going to be right now the plants are

1022
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:52,789
about as tall as me but I know they and

1023
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:55,190
they're starting to flower

1024
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,650
so there's they're not going to get to

1025
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:00,570
be like this

1026
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:04,800
yeah so

1027
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:08,580
when one thing I'd like to mention is is

1028
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:13,140
the seat cost so we're testing 32

1029
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:15,719
varieties and some of them cost just

1030
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:18,480
under $3 the problems when you include

1031
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:21,029
shipping these and some of them are over

1032
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,820
$30 a pound when you include shipping

1033
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:26,610
fees so when we're just buying enough

1034
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:29,760
for our trials that may not be able to

1035
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,720
be killed but I'm sure what you folks

1036
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,140
are planting

1037
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:38,579
many many acres of itself that would add

1038
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:40,679
up really quickly so I know there's

1039
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:42,299
people doing economic analysis of that

1040
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,279
as well we hope to provide that to you

1041
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,500
all as well as you can see like maybe

1042
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,390
you get a little bit of video both with

1043
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:53,789
something that you're paying $32 a pound

1044
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:55,619
for but if it's not if you're not

1045
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:58,829
getting the deal you know if it doesn't

1046
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:01,609
make up that initial seed cost would be

1047
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:01,610
very important

1048
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:08,090
you harvest is coming so we don't have

1049
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:10,239
an amazing information about that for

1050
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,240
this

1051
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:25,549
[Music]

1052
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:41,050
so we are reporting the maturity at

1053
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,329
different times throughout the year so

1054
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:44,980
we should be able to report on watering

1055
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:49,539
times for each of the different

1056
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:52,329
varieties so what are the things that

1057
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:54,340
what we are going as differences and put

1058
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:57,190
in our trials and problems and the

1059
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:59,890
company information so we know we don't

1060
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:05,800
have that from one year to the next

1061
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:07,299
but we do have that for this care

1062
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,519
and the flowering time because we're

1063
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,110
covering almost 2 degrees latitude with

1064
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,110
flowering times making different as long

1065
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:31,990
no it didn't stop but so from that point

1066
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,420
on it's just the flowering at six roses

1067
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:35,879
so

1068
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,030
the part that would snap off easily and

1069
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,099
would not be really useful for the fiber

1070
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,099
[Music]

1071
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:44,150
we Marvis

1072
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,890
the treasures

1073
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,890
ready

1074
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:13,308
his question was have we done any

1075
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:15,230
reading Giles we attempted to read some

1076
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:18,410
of our material and if it fell last year

1077
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:21,710
then if it's a learning process

1078
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:26,929
I'll say we did take stands out of each

1079
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:28,909
plot and we love humidity things in the

1080
00:58:26,929 --> 00:58:30,679
greenhouse to saw the plastic guides so

1081
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:32,629
we kept trying to get a tooth threat

1082
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:34,519
that way so we do have some of that

1083
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:38,838
information just on a few stems from

1084
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:48,048
each one but the field readiness is I

1085
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:49,969
think it's a part so this year for our

1086
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:52,849
fiber trials we're working with dr. Jeff

1087
00:58:49,969 --> 00:58:55,179
Nelson at SUNY New Paltz together with

1088
00:58:52,849 --> 00:58:58,240
Jennifer Jenkins at Moscow State College

1089
00:58:55,179 --> 00:59:00,500
so together the three of us define

1090
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:04,068
reading protocols that we're going to

1091
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:07,010
use for our fiber trials so we will feel

1092
00:59:04,068 --> 00:59:10,159
threatened all of our fiber this year

1093
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:12,680
the German a weight of straw which we

1094
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,719
didn't do last year for each block and

1095
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:17,139
then shared some of that material with

1096
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,139
Jared

1097
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:28,880
everything's happy to share on the last

1098
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:31,759
year we made all of our Florida rose to

1099
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,599
a gentleman who actually has his own pit

1100
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,820
and so heat water retinic and he sent us

1101
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,349
some of the information that you see but

1102
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:42,070
I think it was her Snickers kind of

1103
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:42,069
trying to

1104
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,770
it's on our website but we think he

1105
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,440
asked if we had published our great

1106
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:08,739
deals from last year it's not in a

1107
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,409
peer-reviewed publication yet most of

1108
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:14,409
those chronometers require two years of

1109
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:17,710
data to publish it

1110
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:19,659
so I believe we're waiting take up this

1111
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:23,230
year's data but but we do have people

1112
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:25,809
certainly event progress so you can see

1113
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:31,510
the ranges of the different locations

1114
01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:33,670
based on income plan - if it's not bad

1115
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:36,340
or I'd be happy to email it to you

1116
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:38,680
directly from last year there was huge

1117
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:41,090
variation depending on location like

1118
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:43,049
some locations are just like around 600

[Music]

1120
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:48,730
pounds per acre for the yield so pretty

1121
01:00:45,909 --> 01:01:00,759
close those were things that poor

1122
01:00:48,730 --> 01:01:04,559
establishment pressure I mean it's quite

1123
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,560
a range across different places

1127
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:41,919
plantings went in probably 10 days later

1128
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:43,930
than we would have liked again because

1129
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,858
we're waiting here waiting for five

1130
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:49,659
received comfortability so that has been

1131

a real challenge my number one piece of

1132
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:56,018
advice for all of you here is ordered

1133
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:58,509
your seed early light and evident by

1134
01:01:56,018 --> 01:02:01,689
February even from cannabis kenan stone

1135
01:01:58,509 --> 01:02:05,650
is here from you sees the delays in

1136
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:08,440
getting seed canada into the u.s. seemed

1137
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:10,650
to be even worse this year supported

1138
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,380
receiver

1139
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:15,690
so match our [ __ ] from Nelson shield

1140
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,490
this group is going to talk about some

1141
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:20,358
of the sampling he's been done doing

it's not here actually today going on

1145
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:39,609
but I've been working this surveyed the

1146
01:02:37,539 --> 01:02:41,559
insect monster out the industrial Han

1147
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:44,019
fields so I think the best way to show

1148
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:48,519
you got this brochure here so if you

1149
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:49,840
don't have one there's a couple more so

1150
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,320
basically this whole summer without your

1151
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,300
doing

1152
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,760
it's going out to various farms up in

1153
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:57,430
ten different counties so far this

1154
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,080
season too sweet for insects and kinda

1155
01:02:57,429 --> 01:03:02,079
get an idea of what's actually out there

1156
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:06,969
in the fields what may be a issue for

you'll see there's three different

01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:18,330
March plant book and that is by far the

1162
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:18,329
highest conformation

1163
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:21,670
and so there's a little bit of

1164
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:23,269
information that I want a tool on

1165
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:25,579
recording

1166
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:31,940
the Phoenix tiles but if you want to

1167
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:35,219
learn more about leviton hair and then

1168
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:37,230
on the center panel here we have here

1169
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,909
I've only seen this and watch our

1170
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,639
culture how election and that was down

1171
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:44,368
in Orange County and that was the most

1172
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:46,679
devastating second scene so far it only

1173
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:48,900
went out for two less but it took the

1174
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:51,599
weapon board into this

1175
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,579
resulting death attire

1176
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,469
so that girl rabbit they got those two

1177
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:58,469
CBD girls

1178
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:59,429
so as you can see and as Gary was

1179
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:01,919
talking about earlier

1180
01:03:59,429 --> 01:04:04,949
does he isn't it sexy to be like a

1181
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,840
working working document basically so

1182
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:09,569
the part I've seen something take a

1183
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,850
picture or like that feel free to send

1184
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:15,410
them a lot to me my email is on this

1185
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:15,409
burner or just like that

1186
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:21,750
so that's how we heard about the

1187
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,849
European Court order and also we got

1188
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,338
flea beetles which seem to be in very

1189
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:28,430
high population as well that's the far

1190
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:30,489
far right panel and

1191
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:33,319
and the flea beetle is basically a

1192
01:04:30,489 --> 01:04:38,669
vegetative Peter stay with the bees

1193
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:41,190
it was minimal kind of feeding size

1194
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:43,470
and so not necessarily something that's

1195
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,909
going to be harming here your deal in

1196
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:48,689
the long run to put something to keep an

1197
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:50,098
eye on very beautiful and I know that's

1198
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:52,739
under fold in here if you have a

1199
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:55,259
Japanese beetle so if you're a grower

1200
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:57,568
volunteer which if you are out here you

1201
01:04:55,259 --> 01:05:01,278
know we have a lot of Japanese beetles

1202
01:04:57,568 --> 01:05:05,788
in this area so the good news is I have

1203
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:08,159
plants but that one example below is an

1204
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:09,809
example of what they have to do so it

1205
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:12,629
may be something that you could buy for

1206
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:13,920
the future three years of growing and

1207
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,349
you see a high Japanese beetle

1208
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:22,769
population travels are other ways to

1209
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:25,798
combat this this whole project has been

1210
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:27,959
based on an insect path so insects that

1211
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:30,179
are actually in particle web but I've

1212
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,880
been seeing a lot of natural predators

1213
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:35,480
about which is a good sign so if we're

1214
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,150
seeing these these high levels of nuts

1215
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:42,449
and it's also featured it's the high

1216
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:43,759
number of private degrees that means

1217
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:45,828
that they're actually

1218
01:05:43,759 --> 01:05:48,380
good sense of file control in these

1219
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:50,719
countries so as we all know there's

1220
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:53,689
nothing listed for your spray-on heaven

1221
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:55,969
as of right now and it's going to be a

1222
01:05:53,688 --> 01:06:01,038
continuing process of planning what's

1223
01:05:55,969 --> 01:06:03,249
out there so we're at the mercy of your

1224
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,249
help

1225
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:23,170
just methods and helpful proactive is

1226
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:23,170
just sort of

1227
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:30,519
yeah so the question is what steps have

1228
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:33,550
you taken to assure that your trying to

1229
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:35,588
help reduce these tax levels and just

1230
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,900
overall agricultural practices

1231
01:06:35,588 --> 01:06:38,889
controlling weeds keeping weeds low

1232
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,680
because a lot of

1233
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:45,278
that attracts other paths that are going

1234
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:47,500
to be attracted to area natural rotation

1235
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:48,840
is a big one so if you're drawing the

1236
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,309
same field

1237
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,720
you're going to want to switch it out

1238
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:56,029
because then you're going to have the

1239
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:57,799
same population not say so from the park

1240
01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:00,010
last one

1241
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,010
okay

1242
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:08,469
yeah so the slugs and snails are a

1243
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:09,299
little interesting themselves but it's

1244
01:07:08,469 --> 01:07:13,049
not

1245
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:15,780
inside every but I haven't seen in the

1246
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:18,660
audio when at UCL one thing that I have

1247
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:21,450
seen from the barber stuff in op 2 is

1248
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:23,099
diatomaceous period so that's a material

1249
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:27,149
that you can use to base it as America

1250
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:31,130
when the slugs and ears and so that's

1251
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:31,130
not necessarily a chemical based control

1252
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
yes

1253
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:49,558
I'm sorry disease okay so that's that's

1254
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:52,169
a big question

1255
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,220
so these don't have a lot of natural

1256
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:56,849
predators the ones that I've

1257
01:07:53,219 --> 01:07:58,409
specifically highlighted here the more

1258
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:59,579
of the things that which makes that's

1259
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:01,348
why I'm not seeing them at high

1260
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:03,329
populations because of the natural

1261
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:05,910
predators would be things like drips

1262
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:09,028
deep it's more of the soft bodied

1263
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:14,608
insects so these predators where it is

1264
01:08:09,028 --> 01:08:16,889
will inject their killed on the inside

1265
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:19,289
it's kind of like a parasite there's a

1266
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:21,420
toilet and then also it's feeding off of

1267
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:23,350
the insects themselves so the Japanese

1268
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:26,350
people as many of you know

1269
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:28,960
pretty as a part exoskeleton it doesn't

1270
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:30,850
have many many natural predators and so

1271
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,100
with these kinds of things and I think

1272
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:35,050
the long term goal is your operation

1273
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:38,140
controlling whether in terms of

1274
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:40,949
pesticides worked their other pilot or

1275
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,950
controls again pretty

1276
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:47,699
never seen any more or less issues

1277
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:49,889
so the greenhouse production is

1278
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:51,630
interesting I have I've only seen two

1279
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:54,630
different trials I've been made for

1280
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:56,760
greenhouse and a lot of clients actually

1281
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:59,670
majority applies are just attracted to

1282
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,380
the planet so they're not necessarily

1283
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:03,659
following family just repeating all the

1284
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,380
leads but they're they're a nuisance in

1285
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:06,380
the sense of China

1286
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:12,708
yeah so the fungus gnats are actually I

1287
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:15,019
haven't seen

1288
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:16,630
it's just because meet the one green

1289
01:09:15,019 --> 01:09:18,679
house I was it was a speed house

1290
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:22,130
transplant house basically it's their

1291
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:23,179
party of officers outside but the focus

1292
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:26,630
that is something to keep in mind

1293
01:09:23,179 --> 01:09:28,868
especially with consistent wanting the

1294
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,868
skill

1295
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:36,029
so I actually have only seen one one

1296
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:38,219
case of spider bites which is pretty

1297
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:39,539
good but it has as you all know we're

1298
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,789
kind of getting into the season where

1299
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:44,340
everything's flowering and problems a

1300
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:46,109
work done in Colorado in the West you

1301
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:48,000
see a high percentage of the spider

1302
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:49,469
bites coming after flower and especially

1303
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,579
in flowers

1304
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:52,579
so something that

1305
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:09,730
[Applause]

1306
01:10:04,649 --> 01:10:11,739
that is an internal extension at Cornell

1307
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:14,199
another graduate I just want to take

1308
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:16,029
this opportunity because of that skies

1309
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:19,199
with seasoned meat to mention that we

1310
01:10:16,029 --> 01:10:21,670
have a number of our CCP tag team

1311
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,750
specialists here and maybe they could

1312
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:33,880
stand up

1313
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:41,189
so Mike hunter giving you a meal like

1314
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:41,190
standard Eric over Janice technique

1315
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:51,709
and John John can chart we made copies

1316
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:54,719
of general and sharks Oh a journey late

1317
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:57,019
so it's been tremendous working with all

1318
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,149
these folks and when you have problems

1319
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:04,369
they are can be your first line of

1320
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:09,859
defense so by all means get their carts

1321
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:09,859
at their regional locations so they

1322
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:19,309
okay so I'm going to talk about an

1323
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:21,439
experiment that we're taking on and to

1324
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:24,920
try to address one of the I think one of

1325
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:28,149
the important issues that faces and

1326
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:31,730
cultivation especially as we move

1327
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:33,710
towards an adult use marijuana program

1328
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:37,159
if that's going to be outdoor experience

1329
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:41,500
so they Williams at the University of

1330
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:43,569
Kentucky who is one of our primary

1331
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:46,599
academic researchers in

1332
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:50,679
country shirt would be this unpublished

1333
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:53,819
data that highlights their issue that is

1334
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:57,578
if you are going for CVD production

1335
01:11:53,819 --> 01:12:00,658
there is a choose 2 3 fold decrease in

1336
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:05,658
CBD concentration and the flower shoes

1337
01:12:00,658 --> 01:12:10,929
when the female flower to come holiday

1338
01:12:05,658 --> 01:12:13,698
so that is your profits Ritter in a way

1339
01:12:10,929 --> 01:12:19,190
when your female plants are female

1340
01:12:13,698 --> 01:12:22,359
plants are falling it seems to be even

1341
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:22,359
worse on some of the lower

1342
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:30,150
the question is except the same with THC

1343
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:31,380
yes essentially the entire pathway and

1344
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:32,939
I'm not sure whether it's because the

1345
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,609
decrease in the director of the

1346
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:37,799
trikonasana fish's work down regulation

1347
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:41,089
of the enzymes

1348
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:46,100
the bottom line is you want to maintain

1349
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:46,100
in a horticultural crawl stepping

1350
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:52,320
email plans on politics that's a key

1351
01:12:50,609 --> 01:12:54,239
question that I think that we're facing

1352
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:57,689
this is a question for migrating

1353
01:12:54,239 --> 01:13:00,649
progress is whether we continue on in

1354
01:12:57,689 --> 01:13:06,210
this horticultural City and wide spacing

1355
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:07,388
from transplants female plants planted

1356
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:09,000
with

1357
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:11,029
Oh

1358
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,550
so I have one grower tell me to give us

1359
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:20,029
$20,000 of acres investments and seeds

1360
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:23,010
and labor that actually can be cut so

1361
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:27,208
artistic nose plant by hand and drying

1362
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:29,760
them will add up for the fall into

1363
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:33,448
the alternative is a more agricultural

1364
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,400
system in tight spaces allowing those

1365
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:37,708
plans to get pollinated perhaps

1366
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:40,109
capturing a great meal in addition to a

1367
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:46,170
seed to be healed mechanically harvested

1368
01:13:40,109 --> 01:13:48,478
a drug that the seal turn and I think we

1369
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:51,958
could breathe for both of ours that

1370
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:55,349
produces even higher of CVD so last year

1371
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:57,599
future of 75 one part annual purpose

1372
01:13:55,349 --> 01:14:01,349
greatest vital part of elephant turtle

1373
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:06,569
workers because it produced 2% CBE while

1374
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:08,980
also producing a reasonable brain so I

1375
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:12,340
think this

1376
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:16,009
fundamental cultivation issues that

1377
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:18,760
growers will address we hope to reach

1378
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,760
Barb's

1379
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:25,779
the Duster all have denominated they

1380
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:28,469
come up and talk about some of the fees

1381
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:31,238
that he's seen in deal so far this year

1382
01:14:28,469 --> 01:14:34,448
but those bees that are attracted to

1383
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:35,959
male flowers are not attracted to the

1384
01:14:34,448 --> 01:14:38,960
female

1385
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:41,739
there's no that the production the wind

1386
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:45,060
is very the parlament very light and dry

1387
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:46,739
so to terrify the winds

1388
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:49,170
in the Midwest where there is a lot of

1389
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:54,649
ditch week Darrell Hammond throwing

1390
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:57,380
around in Iowa Illinois Nebraska so

1391
01:14:54,649 --> 01:15:01,149
ethanol can be more than 30% of the

1392
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:01,150
Monastrell in late summer

1393
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:07,079
so it is a major issue fortunately we do

1394
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:09,390
not have very much left in New York

1395
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:13,079
State we collect it from one girl

1396
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:14,640
population in Fort Wayne I've heard

1397
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:16,500
about a couple of others that will

1398
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,500
investigate here in the next month but

1399
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,170
we have very little there

1400
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:23,960
so that is not a major concern you know

1401
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:27,289
state the major concern would be if your

1402
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:31,279
neighbor across the street class a grain

1403
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:34,929
of fiber creels Livonia certain items

1404
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:37,729
right this one a lot of pollen

1405
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:41,380
you're directly downwind

1406
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:41,379
CBD or the future

1407
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:48,219
the question is how far will that

1408
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:55,599
molyneux so there are anecdotal stories

1409
01:15:48,219 --> 01:15:57,550
upon blowing from Morocco Spain it's a

1410
01:15:55,599 --> 01:16:00,130
critical issue for certified steam

1411
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:02,560
production also so we could look to make

1412
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:05,470
a us a standards of the standard

1413
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,520
or certified production a weekly

1414
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:09,579
analysis pandas are

1415
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,780
isolation zone

1416
01:16:09,578 --> 01:16:12,779
my problem

1417
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:19,530
there is no academic research common

1418
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:23,399
topic very little - there's one paper by

1419
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:25,769
Ernie small versus gospel where they

1420
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:30,079
took glass slides towards the trees and

1421
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:30,080
trapped moment at various

1422
01:16:30,618 --> 01:16:34,139
from that class

1423
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:36,259
and that perhaps up in the hand up you

1424
01:16:34,139 --> 01:16:39,670
can see that

1425
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:39,670
over 10 meters

1426
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:47,710
there is only 20% of the pollen range

1427
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:51,559
compared to excellent at 400 meters

1428
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:54,579
there is less than 1% of the pause that

1429
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,580
is produced

1430
01:16:55,119 --> 01:17:01,210
what they did not do is test whether

1431
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:04,539
there is sufficient moment to pollinate

1432
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:08,289
that was female West because less than

1433
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:11,949
1% of the series may be enough to get

1434
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:15,609
falsies so what we have done here this

1435
01:17:11,949 --> 01:17:18,250
is a challenging experiment because of

1436
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:23,159
the site were farm we went to the three

1437
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:27,850
appeal the panga over there in the rain

1438
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:30,659
and then planted female plants of three

1439
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,660
different sorts

1440
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:38,279
for both the ICD decoder in micro plus

1441
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:41,460
one of them right next to the hanka

1442
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:44,460
field or should be a pollinated and then

1443
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:48,869
in the or ordinal directions at 200

1444
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:52,189
meters away and at 4 or 500 meters right

1445
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:52,189
to the north west and south

1446
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:57,488
on the east side we could only go 200

1447
01:17:55,619 --> 01:18:00,359
meters for a property line

1448
01:17:57,488 --> 01:18:03,538
so we jumped to 1500

1449
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:07,170
through our available

1450
01:18:03,538 --> 01:18:08,128
so we will live here the plants porcine

1451
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:10,260
football

1452
01:18:08,128 --> 01:18:16,109
at the end of the season you will want

1453
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:19,280
to buy seal by plants as the measure

1454
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:23,069
functional pollination and we will also

1455
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:26,219
extract cannabinoids and want to buy CD

1456
01:18:23,069 --> 01:18:27,988
production by plant so this will give us

1457
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:32,038
sort of a dual workman's experiments we

1458
01:18:27,988 --> 01:18:34,698
have a lot of site information genus

1459
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:34,698
pipeline

1460
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:41,039
we got nine different sites

1461
01:18:38,849 --> 01:18:43,770
and we will also be able to verify babe

1462
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:47,328
Williams data about a two to threefold

1463
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:47,329
drop to be deeper

1464
01:18:49,389 --> 01:18:55,840
it's our first attempt I think you know

1465
01:18:53,260 --> 01:19:02,199
the conditions here I do state with our

1466
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:04,480
topography with our moist climate of

1467
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:08,979
narrative Oregon and Colorado where they

1468
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:12,098
mock about ten miles movement I think

1469
01:19:08,979 --> 01:19:14,149
our distances will be much shorter than

1470
01:19:12,099 --> 01:19:15,850
the temple

1471
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:18,629
a lot of

1472
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,630
but we need

1473
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:25,039
stop there enough you have to take any

1474
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,039
questions

1475
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:42,399
so the question is

1476
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:45,800
the question is who is going to manage

1477
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:49,159
the geographic arrangement of fiber

1478
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,909
planting bringing fiber lamp a person

1479
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,909
acedia

1480
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:58,939
the state [ __ ] markets has already

1481
01:19:56,390 --> 01:20:01,610
said that they will not regulate they

1482
01:19:58,939 --> 01:20:04,879
are not interested in proposing or

1483
01:20:01,609 --> 01:20:07,719
regulated on exclusions homes to the

1484
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:10,770
preference of CDT producers over

1485
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:13,109
grandpa's apart

1486
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:17,840
what I would suggest is that eating

1487
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:17,839
plankton you get to know your neighbors

1488
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:24,099
because mining is the best way to

1489
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:28,549
regulate that his papers

1490
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:30,250
but sometimes that's not going to work

1491
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:31,930
and you

1492
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:34,039
you may need to work it out through

1493
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:36,159
other means

1494
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:39,010
that may be

1495
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:43,090
talking about rotating needles varying

1496
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:44,280
distances common thinking someone not to

1497
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:49,170
plant

1498
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:53,479
for another field the ultimate assurance

1499
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:53,480
is to move your plants indoors

1500
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:07,079
sorry production

1501
01:21:10,889 --> 01:21:17,579
yes so the question is how much risk are

1502
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:20,638
you for pollination in a hoop house for

1503
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:22,969
example and there is absolutely no data

1504
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,969
on that

1505
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:32,239
I have very small

1506
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:37,069
small master

1507
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,069
are you work

1508
01:21:41,349 --> 01:21:46,710
so yeah if you're really screams to keep

1509
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:53,729
out

1510
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:53,730
I know about the people to keep out

1511
01:21:55,109 --> 01:22:03,670
the pathogen

1512
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:09,130
so I don't what better broker who wants

1513
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:12,940
to keep all active Laura mm and he

1514
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:16,000
actually put HEPA filters on the answer

1515
01:22:12,939 --> 01:22:20,769
the phone has been extremely effective

1516
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:23,560
but so he grows tomatoes and tomatoes

1517
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:26,830
are really happy hundred twenty degrees

1518
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:33,940
Fahrenheit so if you're trying to grow

1519
01:22:26,829 --> 01:22:39,369
ten-four CVD 123 degrees Fahrenheit THC

1520
01:22:33,939 --> 01:22:41,639
levels and I think that builders are the

1521
01:22:39,369 --> 01:22:41,640
only

1522
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,640
other problems

1523
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:17,789
question about isolation

1524
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:20,719
it's ensues for certified

1525
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:26,670
[Music]

1526
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:28,198
regulators so for certified seed

1527
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:32,359
production in Canada great that's

1528
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:36,479
realness we have to have three levels of

1529
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:38,609
isolationism psychosis or certified seed

1530
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:42,869
production as one founders of the same

1531
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:44,609
variety it's a motivational cultivar to

1532
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:46,948
five kilometers within sight relations

1533
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:50,359
between Avanti polymerization cultivar

1534
01:23:46,948 --> 01:23:53,069
has to be prised off perfectly

1535
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:55,198
different cultivars it was the same

1536
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:56,869
cultivar but of a higher pedigrees it

1537
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,129
can be is I think it's three kilometers

1538
01:23:56,869 --> 01:24:01,500
isolation between those different

1539
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:03,270
categories so these are every year speak

1540
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:07,189
up for your summation registered

1541
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:07,190
certified to the level of

1542
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:17,019
other questions

1543
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:19,619
turn your rotten maker pepper

1544
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,620
yep

1545
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:36,579
so the question is will with metric TCP

1546
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:39,320
for all nation and after pollination so

1547
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:41,760
we have not collected any sample tea

1548
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:45,719
there is an active pollen production

1549
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,460
so our intention is a whole is that some

1550
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,760
of these microwatt will not be

1551
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:53,069
pollinated by the end of the scene and

1552
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,489
though it will be our vendor dominated

1553
01:24:53,069 --> 01:24:55,488
plants

1554
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:18,599
oh so that so the question is could you

1555
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:22,650
recover from a pill that's gone hop by

1556
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:24,090
pollinating it I don't know where you at

1557
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:27,649
the end of the season where you would

1558
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:27,650
also get all this long

1559
01:25:32,409 --> 01:25:41,579
but it's a good idea on a small scale if

1560
01:25:35,829 --> 01:25:41,579
you've had plans that elsewhere the

1561

more questions

question about pollination

1563
01:25:55,770 --> 01:26:04,050
there are no public campaign website

1564
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:05,750
again they talk to growers and he'll say

1565
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:08,880
you've got the ten miles away

[Music]

1567
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:13,069
so it's anecdotal

1568
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:18,760
I had enough hi so I've only been doing

1569
01:26:16,779 --> 01:26:22,750
this a year and a half I have not

my field dominated

1572
01:26:26,329 --> 01:26:30,279
I just haven't have an accountant

1573
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:35,809
so there's a lot of heightened don't

what I had what I had to counter his

folks in Europe who said I had my deal

1577
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,360
here my neighbor has his field over

1578
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:52,319
there you can see it

they are never caught

01:33:56,659 --> 01:34:02,979
probably not that there

1660
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,980
so much the expected

1661
01:34:06,578 --> 01:34:11,039
small trial and justice

1662
01:34:12,859 --> 01:34:17,439
but it's also probably a factor

1663
01:34:18,269 --> 01:34:25,369
here by honeybees are bacon burger

1664
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:25,368
foragers

1665
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,000
so they might have something better

1666
01:34:27,869 --> 01:34:32,989
right now that they're going to do

1667
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,989
without not always

1668
01:34:41,539 --> 01:34:45,170
[Applause]

1669
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:52,579
all right we are in the whole gang so if

1670
01:34:50,359 --> 01:34:55,609
anyone does not have a handout Larry and

1671
01:34:52,579 --> 01:34:58,420
then give you one it was like all the

1672
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:58,420
others more or less

1673
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:08,209
I was really looking forward to having

1674
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:11,460
folks up at our CBD trial this morning

1675
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:14,329
because you know when I started this a

1676
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,329
couple of years ago

1677
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:25,969
[Music]

1678
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:28,340
you know there are places for next love

1679
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:32,900
to grow and there are places that have

1680
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:36,560
been really unhappy so where we have one

1681
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:38,869
of our cvd variety styles but look at

1682
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:42,170
the back of the sheet and you can see

1683
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:44,359
the list of writings the varieties that

1684
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:52,779
were planted where it started in the

1685
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:52,779
greenhouse we wanted to ensure and

1686
01:35:59,109 --> 01:36:06,969
where's my and blended into the fuel and

1687
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:07,360
they were still early July July 6 in

1688
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:10,690
honor

1689
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:13,000
indica trial and July 9th in Geneva

1690
01:36:10,689 --> 01:36:16,359
so in those are plants that we were just

1691
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:19,630
at the end of the very dry period so we

1692
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:21,880
had there are late fit with drip

1693
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:24,279
irrigation and lactation and we were

1694
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:26,369
irrigating now and then it started to

1695
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,369
rain

1696
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:34,679
there is a wee bit lower than the other

1697
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:37,409
end so the water rain that way and the

1698
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:39,300
plants that have wet feet for an

1699
01:36:37,409 --> 01:36:40,619
extended period of time even though they

1700
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:43,920
were on raised beds

1701
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:47,430
some of them light outside some of them

1702
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,770
are extremely stunted and if you go down

1703
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:52,230
the field when you get that slight

1704
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:54,630
decline the plants at the end and that

1705
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:57,689
was just a bit drier are doing might

1706
01:36:54,630 --> 01:37:07,560
well so I think it's really important to

1707
01:36:57,689 --> 01:37:09,329
know that it's not always the case the

1708
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,070
reason that we're doing the trial is to

1709
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:14,130
answer some of the questions that many

1710
01:37:11,069 --> 01:37:16,889
of you have asked in terms of you know

1711
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:20,220
what what impact CBD left and what

1712
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:23,250
impacts THC levels here in the state of

1713
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:25,619
New York if you're growing for CBD you

1714
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:29,859
don't want your plant specific above

1715
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:32,409
that 0.3% be level and

1716
01:37:29,859 --> 01:37:35,439
you know we have information from

1717
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:37,420
Colorado and Oregon in Kentucky but we

1718
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:40,529
don't have information on the stresses

1719
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:43,539
in New York for example the plants that

1720
01:37:40,529 --> 01:37:46,059
have now had wet feet for as much of

1721
01:37:43,539 --> 01:37:49,600
their lives in the fields are they going

1722
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:52,660
to have a higher THC or CBD content

1723
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:57,550
because of that flood stress and and we

1724
01:37:52,659 --> 01:38:01,599
don't know so to compare we actually are

1725
01:37:57,550 --> 01:38:04,390
growing the ultra-rich bees at seven all

1726
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,930
turrets dried from Nevada we're going

1727
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:11,260
those in our greenhouse and what we want

1728
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:12,639
to do is compare that you as well as the

1729
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:15,880
CBD and

1730
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:17,349
d level of the greenhouse from plants to

1731
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:20,708
those plants that were grown in the

1732
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:23,739
field and for this year I will compare

1733
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:27,429
the indica trial such an even drop and

1734
01:38:23,738 --> 01:38:30,279
the greenhouse plants and I saw some

1735
01:38:27,429 --> 01:38:31,538
pictures as Damian things show that the

1736
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:33,880
length of the field in a plant

1737
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:36,309
architecture it's one of the things that

1738
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:39,099
were looking at in these varieties so

1739
01:38:36,309 --> 01:38:42,309
ineffective rain and winds down in the

1740
01:38:39,099 --> 01:38:44,889
HIPPA control that last week some of the

1741
01:38:42,309 --> 01:38:47,529
plants actually snacks you have the stem

1742
01:38:44,889 --> 01:38:50,349
wood lips not strong enough to handle

1743
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:52,918
the foliage and the plant architecture

1744
01:38:50,349 --> 01:38:52,918
that was about

1745
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:04,879
so what we're measuring on all of these

1746
01:39:02,579 --> 01:39:07,859
plants right now we are measuring

1747
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,960
establishment if they die we're

1748
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,359
rendering plant architecture we're doing

1749
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:14,520
that by counting the number of stones

1750
01:39:12,359 --> 01:39:15,869
where leaves would come out of plant and

1751
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,300
then the number of notes that have

1752
01:39:15,869 --> 01:39:21,449
branches so that gives you an idea of

1753
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:23,670
how branching eclectus for some people

1754
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:25,769
they're looking for a big branching

1755
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:28,260
plant that looks more like a Christmas

1756
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:30,900
tree and for other folks they won't be a

1757
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:33,239
single peg and so we want to be able to

1758
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:34,109
provide you with in New York in our

1759
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:35,579
thick layers

1760
01:39:34,109 --> 01:39:38,579
what is the plan middle of life

1761
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:40,829
naturally the goal with this so we'll

1762
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:44,220
have a plant architecture for top height

1763
01:39:40,829 --> 01:39:45,609
and in the greenhouse what are what are

1764
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:48,780
called plants now

1765
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:48,779
[Music]

1766
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:59,070
[Music]

1767
01:39:54,948 --> 01:40:02,339
so so we have light as well as

1768
01:39:59,069 --> 01:40:05,219
architecture and then we'll have to not

1769
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:13,560
only see levels but we hope to have the

1770
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:16,079
whole panel so that we can give you an

1771
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,840
idea of what is being produced under

1772
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:22,829
conditions conditions but we have our

1773
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:25,650
process as we move forward we hope that

1774
01:40:22,829 --> 01:40:29,039
people to come here next year we hope to

1775
01:40:25,649 --> 01:40:31,198
have some plans in I tunnels right now

1776
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:33,868
our plants are high tunnels are in a

1777
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,908
place that gets rather wet so we'll have

1778
01:40:33,868 --> 01:40:37,829
to be modified but it'd be great to be

1779
01:40:35,908 --> 01:40:40,049
able to give us information on final

1780
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:42,059
production for the pre-health corruption

1781
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:45,289
versus feel for us and that's what we

1782
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,289
really hope we get to do

1783
01:40:45,369 --> 01:40:52,130
new cultivars come along new genetics in

1784
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:53,569
plants we must be able to test athletics

1785
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:56,239
and one of the things you really want to

1786
01:40:53,569 --> 01:40:59,449
be able to do with experiments like this

1787
01:40:56,239 --> 01:41:03,500
sista test rapidly so we you know sort

1788
01:40:59,449 --> 01:41:06,769
of on the fly understand how stressed

1789
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:10,760
conditions are modifying to secondary

1790
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:12,500
metabolites or CBD in the plants so one

1791
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:15,140
of the things that my life is doing

1792
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:18,529
along those same lines that we're

1793
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:21,110
looking at SESC EPS microbial so you

1794
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:23,179
heard of the human microbiome of

1795
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:26,239
microbes others again and in our stomach

1796
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:28,610
and that affects many many attributes of

1797
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:29,219
our health the same exact thing is true

1798
01:41:28,609 --> 01:41:32,579
in

1799
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:35,880
and one of my students of HB Sigonella

1800
01:41:32,579 --> 01:41:39,920
gala instead look last year at the

1801
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:42,659
microbial of hemp plant and she's now

1802
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:46,529
identified sort of the microbes that are

1803
01:41:42,659 --> 01:41:51,260
on and you know in she looked at six

1804
01:41:46,529 --> 01:41:51,259
different locations for awhile

1805
01:41:53,269 --> 01:41:58,458
but bacteria and fungi are Hotlanta

1806
01:41:56,658 --> 01:42:01,308
these aren't necessarily pests

1807
01:41:58,458 --> 01:42:03,168
they're just present and and interacting

1808
01:42:01,309 --> 01:42:05,958
with the planet it's none of her other

1809
01:42:03,168 --> 01:42:08,809
systems that the microbes on the plants

1810
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:12,738
and modified things like drought

1811
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:15,559
tolerance flowering time and secondary

1812
01:42:12,738 --> 01:42:18,678
metabolism which with food modify our

1813
01:42:15,559 --> 01:42:19,760
THC or CBD levels so we really want to

1814
01:42:18,679 --> 01:42:22,338
know what's there

1815
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,139
additionally if there are beneficial

1816
01:42:22,338 --> 01:42:26,958
microbes that are being you know they're

1817
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:30,260
associated with the roots of plants if

1818
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:32,868
we can identify some of those and we can

1819
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:34,548
work without Taylor who is an expert at

1820
01:42:32,868 --> 01:42:38,238
using things like that to actually

1821
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:40,729
enhance plant grow some of the things

1822
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:41,958
that we're working on one one thing that

1823
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:44,838
Ali found that I thought was absolutely

1824
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:47,988
fascinating was that in them and the

1825
01:42:44,838 --> 01:42:50,748
microbes that are found on the flower of

1826
01:42:47,988 --> 01:42:53,568
the template plant the most common

1827
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:56,148
microbes are those microbes that are

1828
01:42:53,569 --> 01:43:00,340
have previously been reported from

1829
01:42:56,149 --> 01:43:03,490
extreme environments like hot springs

1830
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:05,770
I saw and so there's something you know

1831
01:43:03,489 --> 01:43:08,909
the secondary metabolites in the flower

1832
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:11,260
of the plants that the microbes that

1833
01:43:08,909 --> 01:43:13,569
associate there are zones that can

1834
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:15,190
handle extreme environments and so

1835
01:43:13,569 --> 01:43:24,929
that's something that Pope you would be

1836
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:28,210
into as well right for sure summertime

1837
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:31,680
or noting that in the greenhouse and in

1838
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:36,539
the field and steel plants have flower

1839
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:36,539
earlier than the green HealthQuest

1840
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:43,909
[Music]

1841
01:43:40,409 --> 01:43:43,909
diets monthly

1842
01:43:44,729 --> 01:43:48,929
we do have one but it wasn't planted

1843
01:43:47,859 --> 01:43:52,079
after the field

1844
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:52,079
everything works

1845
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:04,449
so the gardens and our own flower

1846
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:07,020
committee we have four of them are

1847
01:44:04,449 --> 01:44:07,019
cauliflower

1848
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:20,270
but we have we have both larger lines

1849
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:22,100
that still have not allowed so we have

1850
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:24,710
both males and females in the population

1851
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:35,660
and as soon as we see a male we cut that

1852
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:39,210
out and there are females varieties that

1853
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:42,569
come from places that when wet

1854
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:45,060
great question in the future what we do

1855
01:44:42,569 --> 01:44:49,019
we drive right there cultivars we can

1856
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:50,969
handle more rain and if we can find out

1857
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:52,800
that salutely what I think that is going

1858
01:44:50,969 --> 01:44:55,198
to be one of the things that our

1859
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:58,770
breeding program our breeding program

1860
01:44:55,198 --> 01:45:02,250
that is led by dr. smart well we'll look

1861
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:09,510
at a lot with the flowering time as a

1862
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:11,789
license so we do have part of the

1863
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:15,619
lighting in the greenhouse but it is not

1864
01:45:11,789 --> 01:45:15,619
longer than the daily

1865
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:24,649
right right so that's one of the things

1866
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:28,039
that we hope to get out of our high

1867
01:45:24,649 --> 01:45:30,949
tunnel experiments next year is you know

1868
01:45:28,039 --> 01:45:33,079
can we manage moisture via high tunnel

1869
01:45:30,949 --> 01:45:35,409
and how does that compare to greenhouse

1870
01:45:33,079 --> 01:45:35,409
truck

1871
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:46,500
yeah so the question is did the dry

1872
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:48,630
period at the beginning the year of

1873
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:50,609
excess dress and the plants talking to

1874
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:52,000
the flower earlier compared to those in

1875
01:45:50,609 --> 01:45:55,429
the greenhouse and I think

1876
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:00,369
the dry at the beginning following five

1877
01:45:55,430 --> 01:46:00,369
furlongs weapon that is addressed

1878
01:46:00,908 --> 01:46:06,179
that part

1879
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:06,180
[Music]

1880
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,189
our farmer living plants right so how do

1881
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,989
we decide when departments and agree

1882
01:46:17,189 --> 01:46:22,189
with dike when it's 20 days before our

1883
01:46:18,989 --> 01:46:22,189
harvester you can I

1884
01:46:31,408 --> 01:46:35,210
yeah probably going to do that how are

1885
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:35,210
you

1886
01:46:36,998 --> 01:46:43,689
certainly we need to hire and that will

1887
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:46,058
be taken into account and my guess is

1888
01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:48,009
that we'll probably depending on the

1889
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:52,349
weather sake sometime between mid to end

1890
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:52,349
of September and then 20

1891
01:47:01,529 --> 01:47:06,179
right great questions that I've been

1892
01:47:04,109 --> 01:47:08,579
about plant architecture insight and how

1893
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:10,950
that we take it into account and improve

1894
01:47:08,579 --> 01:47:13,380
event might happen and it will feed or

1895
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:17,159
not to in any and it's proving at all

1896
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:20,079
there are some

1897
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:22,949
but we're not doing anything on it for

1898
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:22,949
this particular time

1899
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:33,600
so in future trial

1900
01:47:35,769 --> 01:47:42,360
music I'll be doing burnings make loans

1901
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:44,920
and for my part of the experiments I

1902
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:47,828
won't be doing to make clothes out of

1903
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:49,059
the litter if you have documents so the

1904
01:47:47,828 --> 01:47:50,710
issue is

1905
01:47:49,059 --> 01:47:52,579
the material transfer agreement number

1906
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:56,779
would you

1907
01:47:52,578 --> 01:48:00,698
so if we are restricted

1908
01:47:56,779 --> 01:48:00,698
cultivating and propagating

1909
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:10,029
we'll probably try to do

1910
01:48:06,949 --> 01:48:10,029
for breeding applause

1911
01:48:18,579 --> 01:48:26,600
[Applause]

1912
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:29,489
mention one project that were worth

1913
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:31,380
which is too

1914
01:48:29,489 --> 01:48:32,829
I'm sure many of you have seen the

1915

zooming through the pile of galaxies

1930
01:49:20,469 --> 01:49:25,149
so we are trying to do the same thing

1931
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:27,989
for the CPE tell the hearts that folks

1932
01:49:25,149 --> 01:49:27,988
are going to do

1933
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:34,220
I have already collected

1934
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,220
small examples

1935
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:53,170
for us question is

1936
01:49:49,829 --> 01:49:55,849
are those through the Titans

1937
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:58,890
under assertive

01:49:55,849 --> 01:50:02,210
verify the table

on the street

1941
01:50:09,889 --> 01:50:17,179
so I know there are number throwers

1942
01:50:13,948 --> 01:50:17,178
for example

1943
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:27,570
the public and here is

1944
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,569
hi

1945
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:33,700

1949
01:50:48,519 --> 01:50:55,890
okay I think that brings the formal

1950
01:50:52,408 --> 01:50:57,960
presentations to a conclusion

1951
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:59,829
I'm really sorry if you can't make it

1952
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:02,409
out from the deal but I would like

1953
01:50:59,828 --> 01:51:06,399
open it up and give folks an opportunity

1954
01:51:02,409 --> 01:51:09,119
you need to take off you can take off

1955
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:09,119
but if you have

1956
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:13,829
let's open it up for a general question

1957
