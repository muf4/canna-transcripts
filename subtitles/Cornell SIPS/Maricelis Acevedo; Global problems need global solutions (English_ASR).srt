1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,759
University I wanted to understand how to

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,799
deliver resistance in the field I had a

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,000
I have a masters in plan Improvement

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:20,160
because I wanted to be able to provide

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,079
to the farmers good varieties that were

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,559
resistant but I could have not

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,598
accomplish that if I didn't understand

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,239
PL pathology I needed to understand the

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,079
pathogen side so that was my idea get a

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,119
mastering plan breing get a PhD implant

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,558
pathology bring it together so you can

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,238
deliver the best to the forers so that's

14
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:40,599
how how my uh career started working

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,679
with uh in Puerto Rico then uh in

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,399
Nebraska and then when I started working

17
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,198
with the USDA um I couldn't pick a a

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,520
better system it was working on Crown R

19
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,960
of oats but then I Had To Do genetics on

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,039
oats I needed to find resistance and and

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,439
as as if some of you have worked on oats

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,399
you know how difficult is to work on on

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,718
oats it's so witty there was not a lot

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,239
of resources so that was a good training

25
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,599
and then from there I went on into

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,118
working on stamas of we and uh that's a

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,158
story that I'm going to tell you a

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:14,079
little bit about today um I wanted to

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,880
start under this premise and this is why

30
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:19,959
what we do what we do plan protection in

31
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:25,000
general and the protection of of plants

32
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:27,879
of plant diseases into pets is essential

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,680
for food security and a lot of times we

34
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,078
don't see it that way or the media

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,479
doesn't portray that way or the in in

36
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:38,478
general we have done uh research for so

37
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,679
many years trying to increase

38
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,679
productivity in the 20th century that's

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,479
what we focus on how we're going to feed

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,200
the world that's how we're going to

41
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,478
produce more but a lot of times we

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,439
forget that we're already producing

43
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,158
quite a bit but we're losing a lot to

44
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:56,798
pathogens and pets uh in the field after

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,159
harvest and not only in quantity but

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,399
also in quality so if we can try to to

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,840
to retain sort of that loss we maybe the

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,080
job is not so tough going

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,520
forward and we know that feed in the

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,519
world is not new news this uh has been

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,080
portrayed since the 60s we knew that

52
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,800
there was a large population that we

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,040
needed to feed in the future but now

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,439
we're facing having to produce more food

55
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,639
than ever before we need to increase our

56
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,239
production by

57
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:34,759
70% um to be able to feed billion people

58
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,759
by 20150 so that's the challenge right

59
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,079
there so we need to take a

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,359
multifaceted from the production side

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:49,400
but also in the protection of our yields

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,400
and a lot of times I find that

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,280
um sorry about that um when we think

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,439
about food security we need to look at

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,318
the components we need to look at

66
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,318
first

67
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,399
um we need to look at production it's

68
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,199
availability is what we're looking at

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,799
production and also how we storage how

70
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:26,439
we reserve it we need to look also

71
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,080
into how we can afford it how can we

72
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,438
access that food so that would be

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,959
physically like in the market

74
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:35,639
be able to go to the market but also

75
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:39,560
having the uh the money to buy the food

76
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,878
be able to afford it so that's uh our

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,719
accessibility to it but also it's also

78
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,878
how we utilize it so we're talking about

79
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,878
nutrition but also we're talking about

80
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,598
safety um we know we know about toxins

81
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,959
we know about post Harvest so we need to

82
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:58,039
talk about um how to utilize it better a

83
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
balanced diet so food security requires

84
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,919
different components and we need to take

85
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,319
that into account when we do

86
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:08,958
research so how we fits in in this big

87
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:11,438
picture so uh most of you are probably

88
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,840
aware that we eat a lot of wheat the

89
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,639
world eat a lot of wheat but wheat um

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,000
provides 20 to 30% of the proteins in

91
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,280
the world and in many parts of the world

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,959
it also uh accounts for up to a third of

93
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,519
the calories uh that I consume in a

94
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:31,799
daily basis so it is extremely important

95
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,038
you know you know for us here in the US

96
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,120
wheat may be a piece of bread it may be

97
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:39,038
cookies it may be cake but in many parts

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,399
of the world it is what you get every

99
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:45,478
day it is what is the basis of your or

100
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,758
your diet so we need to take that into

101
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,159
the consideration when we talk about

102
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,160
food security it has to be balanced so

103
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,479
weed is not that the only CR that we

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,280
need to protect we need to protect our

105
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,319
legumes we need to protect many other uh

106
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,599
sources of of nutrition but we is

107
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:04,159
essential in that balanced diet

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,360
and I don't think I need to to explain

109
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,800
too much but we know about stas we know

110
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,479
what happened in the US we know about

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,000
barar eradication that started in the 19

112
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:18,240
uh

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,639
1917 and over Al 8 million of uh bushes

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,918
of barberries were eliminated eradicated

115
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,519
from uh the us and it wasn't an easy TK

116
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:32,079
but it was necessary and this is a

117
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:34,519
perfect example how and human can change

118
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,599
the situation this was in a very radical

119
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,680
way we changed the entire population of

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,840
a pathogen by removing the sexual

121
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,038
reproduction in many parts of the world

122
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,918
of the in the US and but there's still

123
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,680
barbares out there we know that in the

124
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,839
Pacific norways we have a a population

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,879
and we are aware and we have seen the

126
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,560
devastation that can cause for example

127
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,038
in in a specific years and a specific

128
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,000
location for example uh on barley we

129
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,079
know that there's still races of the

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
stem R pathogen coming out of that

131
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,279
sexual population that has affected

132
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,120
barley production recently in the US and

133
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,598
even after the Barbary eradication there

134
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,918
were still epidemic so the the solution

135
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,800
uh was not it was not complete but it

136
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,439
helped a lot because now we're going

137
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,038
from seeing you know dozens of races

138
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,680
every year to see more or less One race

139
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,719
every year in the US that is the

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,038
dominant race in the US so that's what

141
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,599
we can do for example ex if we intervene

142
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,038
but that's not possible everywhere in

143
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:37,759
the world it is a solution that it was

144
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,159
okay to do and it was able to manage the

145
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,919
disease because we didn't control it we

146
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,199
manage it for in a particular location

147
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,839
but it's not an approach that we can

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,960
take worldwide

149
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,638
wide so we thought we put it to rest

150
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,799
after the 50s uh we didn't see major

151
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,478
epidemics but then in

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,759
1998 uh William gory in Uganda

153
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:04,719
identified the first few postles of eug

154
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,680
99 the new the new race of the stem Russ

155
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,400
pathogen that uh it was not supposed to

156
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,439
be that these varieties were resistant

157
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,359
had been resistant for a long time so he

158
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,598
knew something wasn't right and after

159
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,120
verification um by with other

160
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,399
Laboratories because there was only a

161
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
few Laboratories that can uh do the race

162
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,120
analysis that was necessary to confirm

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,080
the villance of this pathogen then it

164
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,478
was confirmed that yes it was a a new

165
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:37,519
uh race of stbr and it had beIN on not

166
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:40,719
only sr31 that it was uh instrumental on

167
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:43,719
the development of varieties for the

168
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,680
world but it was also varent on many

169
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,800
other genes that were deployed around

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,720
the the the

171
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,720
world so the news is starting to get out

172
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,800
the thread was there and it got the

173
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,280
attention of the media it got the

174
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,199
attention of cons investors like the

175
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,918
binda Gates Foundation and the UK

176
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,038
department for International Development

177
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,639
and we then was decided to build a

178
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:16,918
coalition of scientists that could go

179
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,519
forward and manage this threat so in the

180
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:23,639
meantime I was at the USDA and I working

181
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,799
on oats and uh thanks to the deliv the

182
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:30,158
durable ristan we project there was an

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,080
opportunity for a post position at uh uh

184
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,958
Ida in Idaho to work on stamas and I was

185
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,519
asked if I wanted to be part of the team

186
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,838
so I decided to take the task and to

187
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,320
start to grow up and and and and start

188
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,640
working with a new uh disease and

189
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,920
shortly after I went to Kenya and

190
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,639
started evaluating

191
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:53,479
materials and uh we look at land races

192
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,439
uh that could Harbor New resistance to

193
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,000
eug

194
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,399
99 and it was during that period of time

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,278
that then I was offer the opportunity to

196
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:09,200
go to North Dakota so after uh one year

197
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:10,639
of being working on uh on the stas and

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
starting to collaborate with the

199
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,958
International Community then I had a new

200
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,240
task that it was to develop my own

201
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,919
research program at North Dakota State

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,399
University to tackle this same problem

203
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,958
they were concerned about eugi

204
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,440
99 and so they got a position that like

205
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,799
one of those was that you don't see

206
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,640
anymore theand it was work on Rust that

207
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,719
was the Mandate so how can I not take

208
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,360
take the chance and say hey let's see

209
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,879
what we can do and see now with the the

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,680
network of people that I have uh not

211
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,360
only in the US but across the world

212
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,120
let's be part of that community and try

213
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,240
to

214
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,639
help so I developed my program then at

215
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,200
ND NSU and you know they needed it

216
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,799
because wheat in nor Dakota is almost A2

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,480
billion industry and this is probably

218
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,359
underestimating uh how we affects all

219
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,440
areas not only of Agriculture but the

220
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,360
economy in general of the state

221
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,079
um and based on the his historical uh

222
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,440
evidence they needed to be worried

223
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:19,559
because yes they didn't have epidemics

224
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,279
of ASAS in the near past because uh we

225
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,199
have been able to manage the different

226
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,639
races and we have been able to put

227
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,480
varieties that have resistance but they

228
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,679
had the environment for the disease

229
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,200
development even the eradication of the

230
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:38,599
barberries nor Dakota saw 56% yield

231
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,440
losses in in 1935 so they knew that if

232
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,920
this ug99 or any other races that were

233
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,399
as verin um got to the US North Dakota

234
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:50,319
would be in big trouble so it made a lot

235
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,639
of sense to to develop a program to

236
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,800
tackle this uh problem so from the work

237
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,600
that I started at at the USDA

238
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,439
identifying another races that have

239
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,920
resistance then I was a able to to start

240
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,880
my project in uh North Dakota that it

241
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:10,360
was to use these two uh land races one

242
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:14,439
is from Iran the one on the top and it

243
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,519
has really good resistance to in Kenya

244
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,560
and then this other Montenegro land race

245
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,480
that has also good resistance over time

246
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,119
so this was the first project that I

247
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,320
started developing with my first PhD

248
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,360
student in North Dakota and so Jason was

249
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
able to map this resistance we

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,839
identified that it that the inheritance

251
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,360
was conferred by uh one G so it seems

252
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,800
like a good project for a student let's

253
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,639
map the Gene and try to determine if

254
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,958
this is a new gene or it's an

255
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,680
underutilized so we can start

256
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,199
incorporating and broaden the resistant

257
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:53,838
base of our

258
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,440
varieties so after a couple of years and

259
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,600
a lot of investment into developing

260
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,920
mapping populations developing new

261
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,399
markets that at that point were not uh

262
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,879
totally accessible because this where

263
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,240
with the snip ships were coming out uh

264
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:13,240
for we um so we were able then to not

265
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,198
only uh find the chromosomal location of

266
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,000
these genes but also this Gene but also

267
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:21,039
map it uh do a high density map that

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,839
would allow us to identify good genetic

269
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:27,278
markers that can be used to uh in

270
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,279
progress this resist to utilize it in in

271
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,120
variety

272
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,639
in the meantime uh we were able to more

273
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,879
resources were coming into weat now we

274
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:42,320
were able to identify uh some potential

275
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,838
genes that can be uh that in the region

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:50,160
and that could be the the actual Gene of

277
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,800
interest uh they are MBS LR uh type um

278
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,919
so at this moment we are still trying to

279
00:12:52,799 --> 00:13:01,120
figure out because uh for those of you

280
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:04,599
that uh have not worked on a hex

281
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,159
uh C it you know it seems

282
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,040
straightforward yeah we have five G cand

283
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,120
we should be able to go in and identify

284
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,319
this gen and that is not the case with

285
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
we because you have so many repetitive

286
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,480
units and you have duplications of the

287
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,399
gene so every time you time to map it in

288
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,839
the B genome then you find it again in

289
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,360
the D genome and you're like okay so

290
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,360
what I'm dealing with so I've been

291
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,839
really a grow a a Growing Experience a

292
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,639
learning experience uh for me and for

293
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,320
myself

294
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,198
student um so when we were worrying

295
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,680
about trying to clone the Jean because

296
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:43,120
that was the the the golden uh child was

297
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:45,159
to to try to clone this Gene e99 start

298
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,799
changing so now we were're not dealing

299
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,559
with one or two race we were working now

300
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,399
at this moment with 13 different

301
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,359
variants and our great Gene it was

302
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,958
effective to some of them but not to all

303
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,240
of them so the work wasn't done we

304
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,198
needed to find more resistance so we

305
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,320
start working then with addition looking

306
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,719
for new sources of resistance so we went

307
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,000
to our second choice that was that

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,639
montro land race that uh race uh that

309
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,039
land race seemed really really good we

310
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,399
tested again uh 20 races North American

311
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,480
races and the variant that we had

312
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,600
accessible from the East Africa lineage

313
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,920
and it was resistant to all of them so

314
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,040
we said this is the one we will go after

315
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:33,479
it um and then we start doing the

316
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:35,319
mapping and what we found is that it was

317
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,159
not normally distributed when we look at

318
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,560
the

319
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,159
population so we was like okay this is

320
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,000
not looking good it's not one gene it's

321
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,240
multiple genes that we're dealing with

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,958
now um we saw that uh there was

323
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,399
transgressive segregants and when we

324
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,719
start doing the

325
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,198
mapping we have lots of gen uh or at

326
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,800
least qls in the in this background so

327
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,758
it made it really difficult because some

328
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,240
of these uh

329
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,360
genes for example like sr12 is not

330
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,320
effective against ug99 but our Gene is

331
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,560
right underneath sr12 so or we have a

332
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,160
different ala of sr12 or there's another

333
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,198
Gene in the same region and because we

334
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,838
don't have a genome of the of whe

335
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,479
there's a lot that we don't know what's

336
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,040
happening in that particular region so

337
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,199
that's just to show you an example so we

338
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:27,958
find multiple

339
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:32,879
qtls uh in in the chromosomes C and and

340
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:37,198
d and uh 6D 7D in

341
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:39,759
3B and it continues so we have around

342
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,919
five different uh QT when we did an

343
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,560
inheritance yes it was not melan it's h

344
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,519
quantitative but it is a great

345
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,278
resistance so I'm not ready to give up

346
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,839
we we see it in the field side by side

347
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:58,639
with our checks and our line has zero no

348
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,399
disease is mostly immune every year so

349
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,959
what's going on we need to get to the

350
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,318
Bott the bottom of it but uh it it is

351
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,439
challenging but I think that's what we

352
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:10,439
do science we just want to know why you

353
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,440
know how we got here so it keeps us

354
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,440
interesting um yeah so it is uh in

355
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,958
addition when we look at the different

356
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,319
uh qls they have an additive effect so

357
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,239
we know we cannot just bring one of the

358
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:29,318
jeans we need to bring multiple uh cils

359
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,039
or jeans uh into this pet if we want to

360
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,639
have that level of persistance so for

361
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,639
those of you that Do genetics and

362
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,639
breeding then you know what the Tas the

363
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,440
Tas is in hand we need to be able to

364
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,240
bring all this genes together and we're

365
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,720
talking about one trade and briers have

366
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,639
to worry about how many um so so it

367
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,240
makes it really interesting and and

368
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,240
challenging but I think it's all worth

369
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,360
it because we know what would happen if

370
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
we don't do the

371
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,360
job so another project that I was

372
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,759
involved uh more on the pathogen side

373
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,480
was working on uh looking at the

374
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,480
population

375
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,599
of pinia Trina so not stas we're now

376
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,000
talking about leas and this was kind of

377
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:18,399
a personal uh a very personal project

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,318
because I didn't want to just work on

379
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
stem like everybody was working on stem

380
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,918
because it was needed but like I needed

381
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,519
my own little side project so I didn't

382
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,160
give it to my student I wanted to work

383
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,079
on it myself on my spare time so every

384
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,519
time I went to Kenya and Ethiopia I took

385
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,798
samples of the pathogen that I found I

386
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,918
had a permit so I can bring uh C tra to

387
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,558
the states and working with Jim colmer

388
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,880
in the USDA we were able to look at the

389
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,359
diversity of the pathogen and based on

390
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,400
previous uh report from Jim's work we

391
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:54,038
knew that there was a unique population

392
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:57,240
of the pinia triina uh pathogen in uh in

393
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:59,400
Ethiopia something that is never is

394
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,519
never been observed anywhere else in the

395
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,038
world and we didn't know why so what we

396
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,359
start looking at this uh uh isolates the

397
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,400
first thing that we notice is that they

398
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,839
are not virent on the differential set

399
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,840
that we use for classification so now

400
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,759
it's like okay so what do we do now we

401
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,439
put it on the differential set and it

402
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,679
doesn't grow on the differential set so

403
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,519
we can of give it a race number so a

404
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,159
name um so we don't know what is the

405
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,599
Varin complexity of this pathogen but we

406
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,600
know that we see it every year on during

407
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,599
with the tetrao instead of the hexo that

408
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:35,000
is our bre we this is on on the Pasa and

409
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,918
emwe that are also tets in Ethiopia and

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,880
we found similar pockets of populations

411
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,919
in North Africa in in the mediterranian

412
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,720
region but nothing like we saw in

413
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,080
Ethiopia so this is one of the ongoing

414
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,200
projects uh kind of again my side

415
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,599
projects just something to play with

416
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,480
where we can still uh try to figure out

417
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,279
what's going on what is so unique about

418
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,240
Ethiopia we have some hypothesis uh in

419
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,798
Ethiopia there is a lot of

420
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,200
tet wheat that has been there for

421
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:12,319
hundreds over here so this population

422
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:18,400
has evolved in isolation from other uh

423
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:21,639
um we uh we don't see this popular these

424
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,280
tetr being grown as crop in other parts

425
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,280
of the world but in Ethiopia they are up

426
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,720
to 7% of the crop so there is a unique

427
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,720
population

428
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,240
um so we will continue working on it oh

429
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:40,158
I want to mention just this so in

430
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,480
addition to Trina there's another lethos

431
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:47,559
pathogen that is have never been given

432
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,679
much importance and this is a pinia

433
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:53,599
durad duad so again it only grows on

434
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:57,919
Duro and has been observed in North

435
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,399
Africa in Morocco in uh southern Spain

436
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,679
in Portugal

437
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,000
and it doesn't have the same alternate

438
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,400
host it has an alternate host that is

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,279
called anus italica it's and this whe

440
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,240
wheat here next to the wheat so I was in

441
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,839
Morocco visiting one of our

442
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,240
collaborators and we were looking at

443
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,000
leas and we were in the field and I just

444
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,440
see the wheat I'm like What's Happening

445
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,079
here so we know the alternate house for

446
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,840
this other uh Lea that is pres in the

447
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,359
region what is the significance of that

448
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,639
we don't know we don't know if it's part

449
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,038
of the epidemiology of that disease

450
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,880
there we don't know what uh what role it

451
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,279
plays at this uh point but looking back

452
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,600
in the literature there is evidence that

453
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:50,440
these uh

454
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:53,839
pyrogen could uh be a bridge for uh

455
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,320
having uh Rec combination between Trina

456
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,798
and Dua there's a potential for it but

457
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,319
also we have a lot of other

458
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:04,558
uh wild relatives of wheat in the region

459
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,279
that we haven't looked at yet so are

460
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,119
they reservoirs also of of these older

461
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,599
pathogens and that can play a role of

462
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,239
what the Vance that we see in and so

463
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,119
there's a lot of questions out there

464
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,599
that have not been answered yet in terms

465
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,918
of of Russ you know we would think that

466
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,000
by now we have studied Russ so much and

467
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,759
we will have all the answers but it's

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,240
not the case and I like it that way I

469
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,759
like that not only for job security but

470
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,558
also because we know there is a lot more

471
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,400
to do you know there is a lot of

472
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,000
challenges and what it tells us that

473
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,600
there's also a lot of potential

474
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,440
Solutions out there that we are not

475
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,079
aware of because the better we

476
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,080
understand the system the better we can

477
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,798
manage

478
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:49,240
it so um this is the the results they

479
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:53,400
are preliminary uh results of the work

480
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,798
where we see the ethopian uh isolat so

481
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,440
you can see here the these are the bread

482
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:03,000
whe the hexaploid whe is they're here

483
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,679
and here and then uh from Kenya you can

484
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,200
see isol it's also from R but then you

485
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,519
look at what is these EES these are the

486
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,960
one that you don't grow on the

487
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,038
differential set these are the on that

488
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,880
are coming from emmer wheat and from

489
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,440
Duram wheat and they're up here on their

490
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,360
own and they are even different than

491
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,480
other Dural isolates that actually grow

492
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,839
on the differential set this are the

493
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,000
what we call the B races that are highly

494
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:33,558
a virent on the leus genes that are

495
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,839
present on common wheat but they are

496
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:37,720
very very different so what is the

497
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:41,240
evolution of

498
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,000
this isolate how is that to be in

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Ethiopia why we haven't observed

500
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,759
anywhere else in the world in the world

501
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
and what you know is there resistance

502
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,879
there that we have not explored in

503
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:59,278
Ethiopia not only to these uh races but

504
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,159
who other uh races that not only um

505
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,278
we have use in Durham we but can be

506
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,278
utilized maybe in HEX because the

507
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:10,159
isolates that grow on Durham don't grow

508
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:13,359
well on the hexy we the bread we and the

509
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,360
isolates that are virent on the hexy we

510
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,639
are not virent on the D so it's a

511
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,199
beautiful

512
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:25,278
coevolution uh study that they I think

513
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,640
is worth uh worth investing on um to to

514
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,319
determine if there's resistance that we

515
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,559
have overlooked there new path that we

516
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,558
can

517
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:37,480
explore so science it was it was a lot

518
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,000
of fun working in North Dakota having my

519
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,278
own research project having my own green

520
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,880
houses and the grad students but there

521
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:48,200
was a larger call for me um the farmers

522
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,720
were still the main goal getting to the

523
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,159
farmer get it out to the field making

524
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
those varieties available so it was

525
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,200
great mapping those gen it was great to

526
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,720
try to clone the gene but if that Gene

527
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,360
stays in a shell it doesn't do any good

528
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,720
you know we can invest all the time and

529
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:08,079
effort and money in

530
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,200
that research and if it doesn't make it

531
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,399
to the field if it's not useful like how

532
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,440
I'm going to utilize that those genes

533
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,840
that are uh present in that mon agree uh

534
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,360
land race how I bring them together how

535
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,399
that resistance that it's uh effective

536
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,278
only to few races can be combined with

537
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,640
all the resistance that are out there

538
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,839
and then

539
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,080
uh get it to to the field so we can feed

540
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,519
the world so that's how I ended a

541
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:37,158
Cornell because I knew that I can count

542
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,759
on a great Coalition of scientists the

543
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:42,240
great community of scientists that was

544
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,879
uh calling to action by Dr Norman

545
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,640
borlock in

546
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,559
2005 and during when he saw the threat

547
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,399
of Eugene 99 he knew what it needed to

548
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,158
happen and he sounded the alarm so it

549
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,719
was great to know that I was not alone

550
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,480
that there was a group of scientists

551
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,880
that could uh use the expertise I have

552
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,480
developed but also that I can

553
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,000
collaborate with and so I took the role

554
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,278
of coming to uh

555
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,640
Cornell and start working on building on

556
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:19,720
what was built on the durable roster

557
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:22,038
System project from 2008 on and what the

558
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,480
durable roster System project did was to

559
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,480
use a

560
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:30,038
multifaceted uh stem Russ specifically

561
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,000
eug 99 where they look at understanding

562
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:36,319
the pathogen looking at the alternate

563
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,398
host new Gene Discovery and that was key

564
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,240
part of the project but also developing

565
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:43,398
markers for those genes so we can better

566
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,200
utilize them we also look at the nonhost

567
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,839
resistance to see if there was anything

568
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,159
there that we can utilize again to to

569
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,158
try to manage the disas and of course

570
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,679
breeding because if it we don't do the

571
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,000
breeding aspect again it just stays on a

572
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,120
shelf it stays on on on Journal articles

573
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,919
but it doesn't make it to the the field

574
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,918
and then we needed seat

575
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,278
multiplication capacity building was uh

576
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,520
what I what I think is very unique about

577
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,000
this uh project is that it took into

578
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,158
account not only the scientific

579
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,960
component but the social component how

580
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:19,320
do we develop a new generation of

581
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,759
scientists that can take the job on for

582
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,558
the next uh decades because when Eugene

583
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,839
99 came up there was only few people in

584
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,079
the world they knew about stem rust that

585
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:31,398
have seen a stem rust and they knew what

586
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,119
to do so we needed to develop this new

587
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,519
generation of

588
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,359
scientists and then the world has

589
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,720
changed and we know that gender uh in

590
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,719
science was something that needed to be

591
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,120
talked about and needed to be approached

592
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
from a very scientific point of view is

593
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,398
like we need to bring together the best

594
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,038
of the best and we need to be very

595
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:57,158
concerned about leaving people behind

596
00:26:53,038 --> 00:27:00,000
that could bring in lots of great ideas

597
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:03,480
and should be respected equally so they

598
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,759
took into this multifaceted approach to

599
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,120
really deal with the problem and I think

600
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,720
it was it was really what attracted me

601
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,359
to to this position to know that I I

602
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,038
have access and to to this fantastic

603
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,879
network of

604
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,839
people um so this is the partnership

605
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,640
that it was developed during the durable

606
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:26,959
rush for 6 week project and as you see

607
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,759
it's a global partnership and that's

608
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,640
what the one of the strength of this

609
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,679
project because you have experts around

610
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,080
the world with different life experien

611
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,080
with different uh backgrounds in

612
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,639
backgrounds in genetics in plan reading

613
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,678
in Plant Pathology social sciences you

614
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,440
have all of it you have Laboratories um

615
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,640
that could take samples Laboratories

616
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,679
that were very rudimentary but they have

617
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,038
the passion to do the work they only

618
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:58,600
needed the

619
00:27:53,038 --> 00:28:00,640
training so building on that is where uh

620
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,918
the new project the delivery and genetic

621
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,200
gaining wheat comes about it was

622
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,919
launched in uh March that's when I

623
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,240
joined the team and right now my uh

624
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,759
responsibility is to manage the

625
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,720
scientific components of this uh this

626
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:21,798
project is bringing some uh leadership

627
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,720
and some uh help the the scientists do

628
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,200
what they need to do uh be able to

629
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,000
provide for that community be able to

630
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,240
communicate between the different groups

631
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,319
so we work together we don't have uh

632
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,159
competitive efforts in but we would

633
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:42,278
utilize the resources the best that we

634
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,278
can and also come up with new ideas how

635
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:47,079
you know I if I talk to somebody in one

636
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,798
uh laboratory and see that they should

637
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,480
connect to another laboratory I can

638
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:55,278
bring those collaborations together um

639
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,240
but at the same time having a a

640
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,558
background in Ros pathology kind of

641
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,240
helps um so this is how the project

642
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:08,639
looks uh we it started in 2008 this is

643
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,399
the first phase of the d r Sy a week

644
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,720
second phase and now is where we are

645
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:12,719
with the

646
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,880
ggw and these are the main uh objective

647
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,080
of the project that is to modernize

648
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,320
reading programs seit and National

649
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,798
programs in Ethiopia and sou Asia it

650
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,960
also we're looking at surveillance we're

651
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:33,359
looking looking at how the pathogen

652
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,319
change move can we predict it can we uh

653
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,839
put additional models out there not only

654
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:40,319
that we can say oh yeah this is a new

655
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,959
race or the race that show up last year

656
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,519
was this race no we don't want to do it

657
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,440
looking backwards we want it to look

658
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,839
forward can we predict where we're going

659
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,159
to see the next epidemic can we

660
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,558
determine what races have the best

661
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,679
chances of movement into a different uh

662
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,558
location that's what we're looking at

663
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,360
and we're going to continue

664
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,398
um the human capacity

665
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,678
building this is the approach that we're

666
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:09,678
taking similar uh as before um putting

667
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,679
more effort into again the surveillance

668
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,399
uh during the we're using the

669
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,080
phenotyping platform that is where we

670
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:20,119
use our um field plots in Kenya and

671
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:21,759
Ethiopia to be able to screen as many

672
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,918
materials from around the world so we

673
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:28,599
can move forward faster but also we're

674
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:32,440
using new technologies uh because only

675
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,959
looking at rust we are looking at how

676
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,240
can we deliver a better package can we

677
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,000
so resistance is one trade but we need

678
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,038
to look at yeld we need to look at

679
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,079
quality we need to look at a climate

680
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,200
that is changing so now we have to grow

681
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,918
more wheat and less space under less

682
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,720
resources can we find better drought

683
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,519
tolerant um heat uh tolerant wheat

684
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,319
parities can we make that power package

685
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,440
so that's what we're working with our

686
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,519
teams uh

687
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,679
and National programs around the world

688
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,599
to try to identify not only resistant to

689
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,399
Ras or to sector that's another area

690
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,678
that we're looking at but also looking

691
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,759
at we in

692
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,440
general um so as I mentioned we were

693
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,720
expanding our surveillance uh when the

694
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,080
project started in 2008 there were just

695
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:27,079
a couple of of Laboratories that uh can

696
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:30,000
handle race identification and only few

697
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:32,599
uh groups were sharing data on the races

698
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,480
that they were observing now we have uh

699
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,839
many countries collaborating and

700
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,519
bringing data every year so we can track

701
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:42,240
the pathogen better and also predict

702
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,278
where we may observe in the next

703
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,759
season we are continue our breeding

704
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,359
efforts and expanding on the efforts

705
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,519
that were developed

706
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,519
before we're going to bring new

707
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,599
technology like the lyic uh selection

708
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,480
Hydro phenotypic so this brings uh using

709
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:06,480
new technology the best of the best that

710
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:10,960
uh that is out there um to develop new

711
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,960
new systems to do the work uh better

712
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,600
more efficient to deliver genetic G uh

713
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,798
to increase the rate of genetic gain in

714
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,879
we uh we're again we're going to

715
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:26,558
continue using our of what we call the

716
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,039
phenotypic platforms are very large uh

717
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,440
field plots in different parts of the

718
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,119
world that are hotpots for a specific

719
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,440
trades or like in the case of Russ it

720
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:41,000
was Kenya Ethiopia now we're using also

721
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,639
Ethiopia for septoria but also Sim is

722
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,759
looking into uh finding additional

723
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:47,879
platforms that they can utilize for

724
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,519
Drought for example in Mexico right now

725
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,399
they're using uh changing the planting

726
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:56,440
time to be able to uh get drought and

727
00:32:54,398 --> 00:33:00,959
heat

728
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,038
uh test for for um for tolerance of beat

729
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,960
and

730
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,240
and

731
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,159
drought we're going to continue our

732
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,399
advocacy and this is something that get

733
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,480
overlooked so many times the importance

734
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:16,959
of communicating the science not only to

735
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,240
uh the media the public but policy

736
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,038
makers uh understanding the value of

737
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,159
really getting

738
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:29,038
uh science based information out there

739
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,799
uh to remove this the information and

740
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,119
the fears that the public and the media

741
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:37,359
and even other scientists have about um

742
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,918
what what's happening in our part of the

743
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:44,599
world in case uh

744
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,720
of um technology and in in general

745
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,879
reading aspects and and should we

746
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,839
interfere should we intervene should we

747
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,080
do things differently so advocacy it's

748
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,439
key not only for communicating the

749
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,398
science but also to attract uh

750
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,919
additional funding you know I'm sure you

751
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,319
are all aware how difficult is to find

752
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,120
funding for public goods this day and to

753
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,480
continue that work it requires

754
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,559
communication and and communicating it

755
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,800
effectively we're going to continue our

756
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:18,599
talent Pipeline with uh doing a training

757
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,320
of young of junior scientists uh this

758
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,280
will be short and long-term trainings

759
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:27,800
include some week training or sending

760
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,679
somebody to uh for a PhD abroad and also

761
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,720
trying to maintain the knowledge in the

762
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,679
country we don't want uh to deploy the

763
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,519
countries of of their their smarter

764
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,838
smartest people we want them to go back

765
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,679
and have a place in that community in

766
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,559
their in their country so try to

767
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,000
encourage that um gu we will continue

768
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:55,239
also uh advocating for those rewarding

769
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,440
those uh mentors that Mentor females and

770
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,559
minorities and do a great job of recog

771
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,559
that everybody should have a place that

772
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,559
can science and can contribute to

773
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,279
science we're going to do thata

774
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,199
management you know we're talking about

775
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,040
Big Data we're talking about having

776
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,639
drones taking data out there in the

777
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,400
field how are we going to process the

778
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,719
data you know now before the bottleneck

779
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,400
was like I cannot walk fast enough I

780
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:21,000
don't have that many hours in the day to

781
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,760
collect my data now we can collect the

782
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,838
data like what do we do once we get the

783
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,200
data in um so we know that there's a a

784
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,320
bottleneck there so we looking better

785
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,279
way to manage the data and also how to

786
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,838
share it we are big on Open Access and

787
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,760
that science needs to be collaborative

788
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:42,960
that you canot work in isolation um and

789
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,480
and one of the key components of our

790
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,400
project is that every publication that

791
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,639
is the result of our project is going to

792
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,318
be publ ACC and is just thanks to the

793
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,920
support from our

794
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:59,679
sponsor we're going to do uh a small

795
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,760
part on SE production in in Nepal

796
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,118
because of the need after the earthquake

797
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,359
we know that there is a really big gap

798
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:10,760
and we can use this it's an opportunity

799
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:12,480
to learn how to develop a small uh seat

800
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,800
system that could be utilized as an

801
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,119
example for developing other systems in

802
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,359
the

803
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,039
world and we do it from our headquarters

804
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,960
here at Cornell because we know that we

805
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,639
are very well placed to and respected in

806
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,880
the world to to do a great job bringing

807
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:32,199
uh science sciences and and the public

808
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,680
together there's a lot of trust built in

809
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:37,559
this uh University from the part of the

810
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,719
public but also from from our investors

811
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,078
so we are very well placed to

812
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:45,118
collaborate with

813
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,760
others and again the goal is to take it

814
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,920
to the farmer and

815
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,920
makings thank

816
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,519
you question

817
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,639
I hope that I'm back on my

818
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,480
defense I haven't been asked that in a

819
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,920
while U so when we talk about durability

820
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:26,480
of persistent we all we talk about over

821
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:29,079
time but also uh overages so D Russ

822
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,280
system is something difficult to Define

823
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,119
because you can only really look at it

824
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,160
when you look backwards like how long it

825
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,119
lasted where was uh established but we

826
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,399
know that there are some key components

827
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,599
that seem to be correlating with

828
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,680
durability so we're talking about not

829
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,800
putting High uh selection pressure on

830
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,559
the pathogen so the pathogen doesn't

831
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,440
evolve as fast so for example using uh

832
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,960
like uh slow rusting G seem to be

833
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,119
associated with uh durability in some

834
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,880
cases not in all thees some cases we

835
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,838
have seen that there's uh some

836
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,800
correlation there um but we know that

837
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,159
some uh genes that have lasted for a

838
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,480
long period of time like the sr31 was

839
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,000
aning progression from a different

840
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,760
species to each so there are some key

841
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,199
components that that we don't understand

842
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,200
clearly yet uh but there's also some

843
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,358
some dangers when we start swapping

844
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:25,358
jeans you know are we going to make the

845
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:28,039
system more easier to evolve so the

846
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:30,440
pathogen now can go into other

847
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,960
other crops that it was not hose in the

848
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,358
past we have not seen that necessarily

849
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,358
with with our rust but we know that

850
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:40,199
could be a chance there but in terms of

851
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:43,880
durability we're trying to

852
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:45,960
find ways to stack more genes so when we

853
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,240
took we look at durability like if we

854
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,720
put three to five gen together and we're

855
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:56,078
talking about uh that the pathogen needs

856
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:59,078
to mutate four or five times to be able

857
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,519
to over that resist in that particular

858
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:03,280
variety so if we reduce the amount of

859
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,920
inoculum because the pathogen kind of

860
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,480
grow on this plant

861
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,880
enough we are reducing the inoculum that

862
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,318
is there the mutation rate uh is there

863
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,720
but the chances of you know one billion

864
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,679
spores versus two billion spores maybe

865
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,078
we we reduce the chance of amutation

866
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,519
that can overcome a particular

867
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,680
resistance so I think the durability has

868
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,880
to be looked from different aspect from

869
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,919
the host side but also what it's doing

870
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:33,519
on the pathogen side the

871
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,519
population so that kind of answers your

872
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,079
question more

873
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,399
I know we're always excited what's new

874
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,480
in the pipeline so there's a couple of

875
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,639
things on the surveillance aspect so

876
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,880
surveillance is sampling more uh but

877
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:17,598
also have uh better sources in the

878
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,358
genotypic side of things so can we

879
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,800
identify uh markers that would tell us

880
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:26,000
is a ug99 or it's not a ug99 rate so now

881
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,119
we have that in place uh that at least

882
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
can tell us the group type we are not

883
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,280
been we have not been able to develop

884
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,318
races specific markers yet uh but we can

885
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,240
tell that it belongs in L uh so that is

886
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,199
part that gets incorporated as soon as

887
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,239
samples are collected they are sent to

888
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:47,078
Minnesota or to Denmark and they can be

889
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:50,358
uh uh evaluated that way we hope that we

890
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,160
can do more on that and get uh faster

891
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:56,519
responses so we know what we're dealing

892
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:58,799
with uh we're also using more uh

893
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:01,039
technology so the farmer or the

894
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,800
researcher that is in the field can

895
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,800
identify um is the stem rust is leaf

896
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,079
rust is yellow rust can upload it um can

897
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
tell you the coordinates and if we see

898
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:12,920
that it's a Hotpot and we with the

899
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,559
modeling that we have in place can we

900
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,920
say you need to go and spread you know

901
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,838
in the next region because based on our

902
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,480
wind pattern and the weather and the

903
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:25,318
information that we have in hand you are

904
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,039
next one so that's what we're doing with

905
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:31,079
surveillance trying to develop a in

906
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:34,119
system that can be incorporated so it

907
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,960
have different components sort of

908
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,079
connected's question I know there was

909
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,199
always a lot of concern when when it got

910
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:46,119
into IR it has because Barber is and

911
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,719
actually used as a barber berries are

912
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,680
used as a common traditional

913
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:57,358
food so is anything been detected

914
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:59,279
different fance since it's moved that

915
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,559
that's something to be explored yet you

916
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,480
know after the initial

917
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:09,440
uh confirmation of of us9 in we haven't

918
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,519
seen new races coming out of so it can

919
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,159
be many reasons we U you know our

920
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:16,519
triangle so um I don't need to explain

921
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,559
that that's normally how we go in the

922
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:21,079
disease triangle goes this way so we

923
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,679
don't uh so we don't know what that is

924
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,680
but we have not

925
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:29,118
observed special

926
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,640
like the question one of the first let

927
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:44,078
let's look at

928
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:47,039
uh the country situation in Kenya in

929
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:51,240
Ethiopia and many areas in uh East

930
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:53,159
Africa wheat is planted all the time

931
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:54,679
there is one season after another after

932
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:56,838
another so we know there is a green

933
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,679
bridge so once you're harvesting one the

934
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:04,199
other one is already uh in the ceiling

935
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:09,358
stage so the Russ can uh always survive

936
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:12,078
you always have a hope um eug 99 per se

937
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,679
is just a a combinations of of of

938
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,039
berance and one of the key that it had

939
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:21,558
was sr31 and we know that sr31 has been

940
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:23,838
deployed around the world uh in in many

941
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,240
varieties so selection pressure was

942
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:30,480
there uh we don't know you know the

943
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:32,479
first evidence of of9 East Africa came

944
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,358
around that time 1998 but then looking

945
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,838
back at records it seems that it was

946
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:39,159
there before we very very low frequency

947
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,558
so you know with agriculture we have

948
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:44,480
probably selected for it but the

949
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,519
challenge is that there's always inum

950
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,400
there's always H in the area so we're

951
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,400
seeing all these new variants in the

952
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,440
region because the pathogen can keep

953
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,440
mutating and you have all the

954
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,559
um oh so if the ug99 has been picked up

955
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,519
on Barberry um so there is barberries in

956
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:15,319
the region in in Kenya and Ethiopia and

957
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:19,440
one of the Spees can uh is a it's a host

958
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:20,880
of ofia gram so we know that if it's uh

959
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,760
I don't think has been confirmed that

960
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,200
the particular race is on the barbares

961
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,680
but we know the barbares are in the

962
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,318
region we don't know uh all

963
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,318
the role that the barber may play

964
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:33,920
because see the high altitude but it's

965
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,920
definitely there in

966
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,759
the would you comment on use of the

967
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,040
sealing test versus the field test

968
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,480
advantages and disadvantages and

969
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,039
problems so one of the this is the

970
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,679
beautiful thing of working with people

971
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,759
that know the systems uh and know

972
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,719
pathology uh I normally work with with

973
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,559
readers so it's a little bit different

974
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:58,879
so we have to explain a lot but you have

975
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:01,640
the right questions um the the uh the

976
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,760
ceiling test for the weat stem rust

977
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:08,358
works really well for most of our old

978
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:11,559
stages uh jeans so jeans that are

979
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,598
effective at the ceiling so far are

980
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,640
effective at the adult plant stage but

981
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,400
there is jeans that are in the adult

982
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:22,279
plant stage that are not uh evident at

983
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,039
the ceiling stage so we those we cannot

984
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,640
detect at the ceiling stage because the

985
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,558
plants look susceptible but once you put

986
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:31,838
it in the field then you have your field

987
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:34,160
resistance uh in uh so we use both we

988
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,039
use the seing test to detect the All

989
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,558
Stage resistant genes that are normally

990
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,719
rais specific and then we work with the

991
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,519
adult plant genes that are some of those

992
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,199
slow ring that I was talking before that

993
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:48,079
are tend to be not raises specific they

994
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,519
have a broad uh spectrum of resistance

995
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,920
and so then we look at the uh latency

996
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:55,559
period and all of that so both of them

997
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,159
uh need to be used in combination but

998
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,839
the cing test is really help for numbers

999
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,358
it allow us to eliminate a lot of

1000
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:03,679
materials uh but definitely some

1001
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,440
materials that are susceptible at the

1002
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,598
ceiling stage will be resistent at the

1003
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,599
other

1004
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,119
station questions for many of our

1005
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:15,720
students or

1006
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,720
post you're D to know

1007
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,838
great and and uh so the question is

1008
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,640
about uh the technologies that we're

1009
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,039
using like some of the phenotyping and

1010
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:37,519
the genotyping is expected to be spread

1011
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:39,880
across every laboratory or there

1012
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:44,039
specific centers no we have centers that

1013
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,160
are uh are doing the the research and uh

1014
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,159
we have for example genotype laborator

1015
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,719
that are accessible so people can send

1016
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,440
their samples in so we support some of

1017
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,480
the USDA Laboratories or a laboratory in

1018
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,800
Denmark and in Canada that can do the

1019
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,079
genotyping for us and we are offering

1020
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,160
the opportunity of training for junior

1021
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,599
scientists because many countries want

1022
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,118
to modernize the agriculture Ethiopia is

1023
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,240
one of those countries that is really

1024
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,880
looking forward to modernizing the

1025
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:15,118
Agriculture and so they've won molecular

1026
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,400
biology experience so we we're offering

1027
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,960
the training so if the opportunity is

1028
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,079
there for them they're well trained to

1029
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,199
do and be our collaborators

1030
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:30,920
in so I want to thank you again

1031
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:33,039
semar Andel say we would like closer

1032
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,480
ties with theologist

1033
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,000
here marel has offer to have meetings

1034
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,679
with anybody interested in getting to

1035
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,519
know a little better just simply send

1036
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:45,519
her an email here so thank you

1037
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:55,039
very this has been a production of

1038
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:58,039
