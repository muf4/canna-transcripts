1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,879
uh so thank you i'm actually very happy

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
to be here i in addition to being a

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
plant pathologist have an administrative

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,519
role and it's been to be quite frank a

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,760
rather rough administrative week so i'm

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,118
really happy to be talking about

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
tomatoes and research this afternoon

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:26,559
so

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,399
i

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,479
previously taught introductory plant

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,799
pathology and one of the things i would

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
always say is that tomatoes have about a

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,000
hundred diseases that attack them

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
but

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,439
that seems like a lot and it is a lot so

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,480
many diseases

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,159
the good news is that you know

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,119
the most common ones there's probably

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,839
only five or six really common diseases

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,839
uh that we see each year so

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
coming down from a hundred five or six

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
uh does not seem so bad

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,558
i wanted to start with a bit of a

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,759
timeline because right now this time of

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,000
year um what what we're doing

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,719
in our research greenhouses is we're

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,879
sanitizing we grow all of our

30
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,719
transplants for our research experiments

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,839
in our greenhouses

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,760
and

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,079
we want the transplants to be really

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,600
healthy going into the field because for

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,920
my research i want the plants to

36
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,839
you know become infected with the

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
pathogen that i inoculate with so it's

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,799
really critical

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,478
that the plants are healthy growing

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,560
going into the field of course as a

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,478
grower it's also really critical that

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
your plants are healthy going into the

43
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,959
field because

44
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,239
if they start out uh unhealthier you

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,839
know

46
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,359
it's not it's not going to vastly

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
improve you want to start with the best

48
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,280
possible uh scenario that you can

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
so

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,519
sam and i i sanitize the greenhouse

51
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,478
and i'll show you a picture of that in a

52
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,560
second but we sanitize benches we

53
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,640
sanitize the floor we have a concrete

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
floor on on the greenhouse that we grow

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
most of our transplants in

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,560
but we also have greenhouses that do

57
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,559
have um gravel floors and we would uh

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,879
sanitize those as well

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
trellising steaks i i will

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,239
bring up several times but uh sanitizing

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,080
trellising steaks is key

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
um and really anything that touches the

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,640
transplant whether that's flats or pots

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,878
or

65
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,479
you know anything that that might end up

66
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,199
touching a transplant

67
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,199
you're really going to want to sanitize

68
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,238
and then the other thing this time of

69
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,399
year or actually a couple of months ago

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
that you want to be thinking about is

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
when you're selecting your cultivars

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,239
in particular if you had a significant

73
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,318
disease outbreak in your tomatoes last

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,039
year you're going to want to think about

75
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,639
looking for resistant cultivars and i

76
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,280
know that you're going to tell me that

77
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,598
the resistant cultivars are not the ones

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
that consumers like myself always want

79
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,560
to buy

80
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,639
um but if you had an outbreak and had a

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,598
lot of yield loss last year

82
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,799
a resistant cultivar at least in part of

83
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,158
your crop

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,599
is really going to help you out this

85
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,719
year

86
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,639
so

87
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,359
uh the other thing uh i always ask my in

88
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,958
my introductory plant pathology is what

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
is the best way to control plant

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,920
diseases

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
and the students

92
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,079
nine tenths of the students will say you

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
spray fungicides

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
and and that that is not correct the

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,319
absolute best way to control plant

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,318
diseases is using cultural practices

97
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,318
which includes the use of resistant

98
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,439
varieties that plant breeders have

99
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,158
worked very very hard to develop

100
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,560
and that is your first and best line of

101
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,598
defense

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,598
so

103
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,359
uh important strategies for disease

104
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,560
control i'm going to start here and then

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
and then we're going to get into some

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560
images of diseases so

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
starting with clean plants

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
that's clean seed

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,158
um there are

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
extension really actually really

111
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,840
beautiful extension publications on hot

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,719
water treatment of tomato seed i have

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
helped

114
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,039
tomato growers that are concerned and

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,719
particular about bacterial diseases hot

116
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:13,519
water treat their seed and the length of

117
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,598
time and the exact temperature are very

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,280
critical so if you are considering hot

119
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,159
water seed treatment

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,638
you really want an extremely accurate

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
thermometer and timer because you don't

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,918
want to leave them in that hot water too

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
long

124
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,839
clean your greenhouse

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
and all of the materials associated with

126
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,279
transplant production

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
and fuel production including charleston

128
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:39,119
stakes even if you had no disease last

129
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,120
year right because pathogens are tricky

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,478
they can survive in the greenhouse and

131
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,240
you might have had uh some bacteria on

132
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,519
the leaves in the greenhouse but you

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
didn't see the disease and then you put

134
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,639
it out in the field and it was okay this

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,280
might not be true for last year but it

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,519
let's say it was really dry that disease

137
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,198
would never have developed but

138
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,279
that pathogen could still be surviving

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,280
in the greenhouse so cleaning the

140
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,679
greenhouse every year even if you had no

141
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,679
disease last year is really a great way

142
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,639
to get started

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,120
the sanitizers work equally well as long

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
as you follow the label and really

145
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,038
importantly

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
clean the debris from the greenhouse or

147
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,680
the trellising steak prior to the

148
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,840
sanitation because as soon as that

149
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,800
sanitizer whether it's a green shield or

150
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,799
a zero tall as soon as any of them hit

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
organic matter they're going to become

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
inactive so you want to clean up all of

153
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,918
that plant debris anything that might be

154
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,319
covering up where the sanitizer might

155
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,198
need to get to the sanitizer wall

156
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,439
contact that pathogen kill it and then

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,919
become inactive

158
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,279
we keep our floors clean uh eliminate

159
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,478
weeds

160
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:51,198
as i said previously new or clean flats

161
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,478
and raise flats above the ground if you

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,800
can and always scout so this is a

163
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,839
picture of holly lang a former

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
technician

165
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,879
sanitizing our greenhouse um the benches

166
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,439
that we had at the time you can see they

167
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,759
had quite a bit of rust on the frame and

168
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,199
so she would just take a pump sprayer

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,520
and spray right along the edges and all

170
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,680
those nooks and crannies where

171
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,079
bacteria or fungal spores might like to

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,918
hide and she would spray each of the

173
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,599
benches she would also spray the gate

174
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,758
great and as well as the floor

175
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,319
we would sweep out the greenhouse ahead

176
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,479
of time to remove any organic matter

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
we would clean all of the surfaces and

178
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,680
then for flats

179
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,880
or pots that might be touching

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,879
transplants uh we actually dip those

181
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,519
into a

182
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,839
sterile such as green shield or or zero

183
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,839
tall

184
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,000
so this is a picture that i took uh in a

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
transplant tomato transplant production

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
facility in california

187
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
some time ago but i think it

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,000
illustrates nicely

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
the idea of if if there is

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
a

191
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,639
disease one plant

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,598
in this facility

193
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,400
that gets a pathogen gets a disease with

194
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,959
the overhead irrigation how tightly

195
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,120
packed things are and the high humidity

196
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,598
that pathogen will be able to spread

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,959
through these millions of plants really

198
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:19,759
quite quickly

199
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,519
so

200
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,240
scouting and

201
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:28,079
this uh this person right here

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,038
i was able to talk to him his entire job

203
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,038
40 hours a week was walking through

204
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,478
the transplant production facility

205
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,120
scouting

206
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:40,639
identifying where there's a disease

207
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,800
early on is going to enable you to get

208
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,478
rid of that get rid of the plants around

209
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,918
it because the pathogen has probably

210
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,399
already spread to them and move forward

211
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,279
so that the rest of your transplants do

212
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,318
not

213
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,000
get diseased and i realize that you know

214
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,199
most of us don't grow

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,598
eight million

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,680
uh tomato transplants at the same time

217
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,560
but the concepts are true whether you're

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
growing 200 plants or two million or two

219
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,598
million plants

220
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,199
so uh pathogens can be seed borne which

221
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,800
is why it's important to think about

222
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,240
transplant production

223
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,720
one infected seed in 10 000 can start an

224
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
epidemic in a greenhouse with these

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,199
overhead irrigation systems

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,199
and

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,360
the the pathogens can spread rapidly so

228
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,359
scouting is key

229
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,120
so that's what i'm doing at this time of

230
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,478
year

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
and sort of the next steps after getting

232
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:44,000
the plants into the field are okay what

233
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,120
diseases might we expect to see first

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
and

235
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
one of the one of the things we see

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
first

237
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
frequently in the year are bacterial

238
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,958
diseases

239
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:59,120
so i'm wondering and kim will put up a

240
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,399
poll how often do you see

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
symptoms

242
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,000
like like what you're seeing here on

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,080
these tomato fruit how often do you see

244
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
those on your farm do you see them every

245
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,879
year

246
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
most years

247
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,080
occasionally

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,080
never or you don't know

249
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,838
all right it looks like we are

250
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,839
stabilizing

251
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,120
around some years

252
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,200
and

253
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
a few folks every year

254
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
and a couple folks are fortunate that

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,159
they have not seen this

256
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,319
um

257
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,319
so

258
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,200
kim can

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,360
enter that

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,590
and that

261
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,590
[Music]

262
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,559
everyone can see where we landed

263
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,839
most people it looks like c bacterial

264
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,039
diseases

265
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,320
some

266
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,319
some years all right

267
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,958
the three common bacterial diseases we

268
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,600
have here in new york

269
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,439
are shown from left to right

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,159
bacterial speck

271
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,959
which is named because the lesion on the

272
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,600
fruit is very small like a speck

273
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,759
bacterial spec the

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,879
bacterium that causes this particular

275
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,480
disease

276
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,399
really thrives during cool seasons

277
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
bacterial canker

278
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,679
is

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,320
the bacterial pathogen that over the

280
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,958
years i've seen the most here in new

281
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,440
york has a very characteristic lesion

282
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,119
that i'll show several more times with

283
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
that

284
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,679
dark center

285
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,639
it can be

286
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,799
tan to brown center with that white halo

287
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,759
it's called a bird's eye lesion it's

288
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,599
very common as i said bacterial canker

289
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,240
likes cooler weather

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,000
but it'll it'll it'll show up in in most

291
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
seasons unless it's extremely hot and

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,919
dry

293
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,519
and then bacterial spot is the pathogen

294
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,799
we see other bacterial disease we see

295
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,000
most at least frequently and that's uh

296
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:15,199
because it really likes the really warm

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,320
wet season so when we get like hurricane

298
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,160
remnants with those hot uh blowing rains

299
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,160
it's common to see bacterial spot

300
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,199
so

301
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,720
how do we manage bacterial diseases

302
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
and

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,360
i wanted to put this here before i show

304
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
a few more images because i think it's

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,278
good to have some of these management

306
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,639
strategies in mind

307
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,679
so irrigation management is key

308
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,240
and

309
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,439
we want to water early in the day

310
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,600
and this is actually true for any um for

311
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
management of any pathogen

312
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
the the

313
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,439
more dry a leaf is the less chances you

314
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
are to have a disease if you water early

315
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,000
in the day so that the plants are dry by

316
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,919
nightfall you're gonna then if the if

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,399
there is a dew in the night you'll

318
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
spread that leaf wetness out you want

319
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,600
dry leaves

320
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,120
you want good air movement which helps

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
keep the leaves dry

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,039
and you don't want to

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
walk through the field or

324
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,039
prune greenhouse transplants when the

325
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,679
leaves are wet because when those leaves

326
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,679
are wet is when especially bacterial

327
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,159
diseases the sorry the bacteria

328
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,039
themselves can be on the surface of the

329
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,360
leaf they come out in the water and so

330
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,519
as you walk by the bacteria are going to

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,278
stick to you and then you're going to

332
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,720
transfer those to the next

333
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,799
plants

334
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
as i said before we want to make sure we

335
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:43,199
clean the trellising stakes

336
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,000
and copper can help prevent spread

337
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
amara were you going to jump in

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,799
i saw you look like you were going to

339
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,480
jump in

340
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,359
all right i turned my video on just to

341
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,159
be more friendly yeah

342
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,159
so

343
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,240
chris can i ask a quick question yes

344
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,000
marion um how are the bacteria getting

345
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,519
into the tomatoes

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,078
uh so the the bacteria it depends on

347
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,879
which pathogen we're looking at um and

348
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,838
i'll show some images in a minute but

349
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,039
they generally will enter either through

350
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,360
the

351
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,599
[Music]

352
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,000
wound so if there's a insect feeding or

353
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,800
hail damage or

354
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,639
the stomates which are the pores on the

355
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,599
leaves that enable the the plant to

356
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
breathe

357
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,519
or the hydathodes which are tiny holes

358
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
around the edge of the leaf so bacteria

359
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,560
are really tricky that way

360
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,519
um and on the fruit uh

361
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,719
we actually know that the bacteria will

362
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,799
get on the fruit and will enter

363
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,040
in when the fruit is very young in

364
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,759
little cracks that are in the fruit when

365
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,879
the fruit is a very young age

366
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,198
i did not inoculate this particular

367
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,838
tomato plant that has bacterial this

368
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:59,120
tomato fruit that has bacterial canker

369
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,839
but the the trellising steak next to it

370
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,679
had bacteria on it and this picture just

371
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,240
shows how

372
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,679
we know that bacteria can transfer from

373
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,399
the trellising steak to a tomato fruit

374
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,519
or or a tomato leaf and in fact i have a

375
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,919
colleague

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,560
at ohio state who the way that she

377
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,958
inoculates her research plots with

378
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:24,159
bacterial pathogens every year

379
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,719
is to simply use the trellising stakes

380
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,879
from the year before

381
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,199
right so at the end of the season she

382
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,439
pulls up those trellising stakes tosses

383
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,319
them in the barn the next season gets

384
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,959
them back out uses them again and that's

385
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
all she has to do to inoculate her field

386
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,239
plots

387
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,638
that should be enough to convince you to

388
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,440
disinfect those trellising steaks

389
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,680
so what we did is we actually

390
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,720
bought a

391
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,919
a trough that one would use for water

392
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,959
for cattle

393
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,679
and we put a disinfectant in that trough

394
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:04,159
and use the trough we dunk our steaks in

395
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,719
that trough we leave our steaks in the

396
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,679
disinfectant the sterolant

397
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
for

398
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,638
about 10 to 15 minutes

399
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,240
and we'll put we want to make sure that

400
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,000
all of the stakes are in contact with

401
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,680
the solution so

402
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,198
we probably only put about 25 stakes in

403
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,359
at a time

404
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,078
just to make sure that there's contact i

405
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,199
get asked a lot how do you know for how

406
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,559
long is that disinfectant usable how

407
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,000
long is it good

408
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,679
and um

409
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,078
i have not tried these but i know there

410
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,559
are um test kits that you can actually

411
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,319
use to see if your disinfectant is still

412
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:45,679
effective um but we tend

413
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,600
to use it um for about about two we use

414
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,838
it for about 200 steaks right so we use

415
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
it for eight batches

416
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,000
we do uh clean our steaks first so

417
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,838
there's no organic matter left on them

418
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,278
but we assume that there are still

419
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,079
there's still organic matter in the

420
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,078
nooks and crannies

421
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,320
i did want to get a few more images of

422
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,599
the bacterial diseases before i move on

423
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,440
um

424
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,440
bacterial canker the bacterium that

425
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,920
causes bacterial canker is

426
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,279
somewhat unique because it will actually

427
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,360
travel through the veins of the plant uh

428
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,159
in the xylem itself the the water

429
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,720
conducting vesicle vessels and it will

430
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,719
clog those vessels you can see on the

431
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
edge of the leaf right here this

432
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
necrosis

433
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,559
and um

434
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,039
as i said earlier the

435
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,439
pathogen can actually enter in tiny

436
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,838
holes that are along the edges of these

437
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,480
leaves and that's how you that's how it

438
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,560
develops this necrosis one tricky thing

439
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
is that a lot of things can cause

440
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,559
marginal necrosis on a tomato leaf so

441
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,360
that marginal necrosis by itself is

442
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,599
it is not oh i have marginal necrosis

443
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,519
it's absolutely bacterial canker because

444
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,720
other things can cause that as well

445
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,799
these birds eye lesions on the fruit are

446
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,720
an absolute diagnostic sign there's

447
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
nothing else that causes lesions like

448
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,880
that

449
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,480
this

450
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,438
was from a farm that did not recognize

451
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,360
that it had bacterial canker and it just

452
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,959
turned into a total loss of this tomato

453
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:26,000
field uh the plants wilted and

454
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,078
all of the fruit were had some

455
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,319
symptom some lesion on it which made it

456
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,319
unmarketable the other thing i wanted to

457
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,480
show you was just sort of what what does

458
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,759
this bacterium look like it's yellow and

459
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,079
it's slimy and so you can imagine how if

460
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,359
that were in the water conducting vessel

461
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,399
of your tomato

462
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,399
it might clog it up

463
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,038
all right bacterial speck is the other

464
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:54,720
uh bacterial pathogen that we have seen

465
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,798
frequently in recent years until 2009 we

466
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,839
really almost never saw it here in new

467
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,000
york in 2009 we had a very cool wet

468
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,879
season and every year since then we've

469
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,558
had some bacterial speck in the state

470
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
as you can see the lesions are very

471
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,798
small

472
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,679
but do make the fruit unmarketable it is

473
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,679
particularly severe you can see

474
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,360
here i like this image because there are

475
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,600
a lot of leaves that don't have any

476
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:23,038
symptoms but then you can see there's

477
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:25,359
one leaf that does have symptoms and um

478
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,480
you know i we don't yet know why why it

479
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,719
is that

480
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,558
this leaf really

481
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,558
the bacteria were able to enter compared

482
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,079
to the one right next door to it

483
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,240
but that's one of the questions that

484
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,240
we're looking at

485
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,480
we know that bacterial spec that

486
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
actually all of the bacterial pathogens

487
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,279
do have the ability to survive on farm

488
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:49,038
we also know that they can also and do

489
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,918
also arrive in seed or transplants

490
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,558
all of the bacteria will spread by

491
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,559
wind-blown rain and water splashing as

492
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,558
well

493
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,639
and one of the things that i want to

494
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,440
highlight i frequently get asked well

495
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,000
how come on my on my tomato plant some

496
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,640
of the fruit will have those bacterial

497
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,038
spots and others won't

498
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,600
and the reason for that is the timing

499
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,160
when the bacteria land on the fruit

500
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,959
so if the bacteria

501
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,759
land on a tomato fruit when it's less

502
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,160
than one inch in diameter so less than

503
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,839
roughly the size of a golf ball you're

504
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,798
going to end up seeing spots on that

505
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,439
fruit

506
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:32,720
and the bacteria

507
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,200
can actually enter even when the flower

508
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,600
is wide open that tiny fruit is just

509
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,600
starting to develop it can enter there

510
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,519
and those lesions

511
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,918
will stay on the fruit and that's what

512
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,519
you see when the fruit is fully mature

513
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,320
once the fruit gets to be larger than

514
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,079
one inch in diameter i had a

515
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,079
student that graduated not too long ago

516
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,960
and he actually took the bacterial

517
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,279
canker pathogen with a paintbrush and

518
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,319
painted it on to all sorts of tomato

519
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,079
fruits and once those fruits are larger

520
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,158
than an inch in diameter it doesn't

521
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,319
matter how many bacteria you paint on

522
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,400
with that paint brush they do not they

523
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,798
do not get symptoms so um it's really

524
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
in terms of the fruit um

525
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,079
the symptoms are

526
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,678
or the disease can only infect the

527
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,839
pathogen can only affect when the fruit

528
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,840
are young

529
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
so as i said uh sort of wrapping up my

530
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
bacterial diseases uh

531
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,558
they're they're much worse and this is

532
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,840
true of most but not all

533
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,079
plant diseases are going to be much

534
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,918
worse in wet summers

535
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,720
we know our bacteria survive both in

536
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,480
greenhouses and and they can survive on

537
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,640
farm over winter

538
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
they can arrive on seed

539
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,038
there are very limited options for

540
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
bacterial diseases and one of the things

541
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,359
my group does every year

542
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,840
is test potential new options for

543
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,279
control and i would say maybe 10 years

544
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,439
ago i was really excited because there

545
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,918
was a company that was producing tiny

546
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,600
viruses called bacteriophage and those

547
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,679
bacteriophage are super specific to the

548
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,439
back to one particular bacterium and

549
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,038
they'll kill it so it's like a virus

550
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,279
that goes in and only kills the

551
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,599
bacterial kanger pathogen

552
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,839
we tried it but it didn't work so last

553
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,719
year a different company had a new

554
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,879
product and and i still feel like

555
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,759
there's there's a lot of promise in this

556
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,520
biological control strategy and so the

557
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,720
one we tried last year

558
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,200
uh worked better than nothing at all

559
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,960
so that was good but it did not work as

560
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,600
well as the the copper that we put on so

561
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,600
copper is the most commonly used uh

562
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,119
control strategy

563
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,519
and

564
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,000
uh bacteria in terms of timing

565
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,679
bacterial pathogens can arrive any time

566
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,919
of the season

567
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,840
but it is one of the diseases that you

568
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,840
can see early in the season particularly

569
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,558
if it came through transplants

570
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,720
my lab is tested bacteria for copper

571
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,519
resistance there there's known copper

572
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,558
resistance in almost every uh bacterial

573
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,400
pathogen

574
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,440
and we saw some

575
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,519
in the bacterial spot pathogen bacterial

576
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,720
spot because it loves that warm humid

577
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,119
weather

578
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,759
is actually a limiting factor for tomato

579
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,599
production in florida and

580
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,359
we think that

581
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,959
some transplants came up that had

582
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,959
bacterial spot with some copper

583
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
resistance but we really haven't seen

584
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
widespread copper resistance here in new

585
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
york

586
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,200
i will say

587
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,919
that uh in some instances

588
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,240
there can be too much copper put onto a

589
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,120
plant you know the in this case the

590
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,279
copper was not phytotoxic um

591
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,639
but you can see that on the plat the

592
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,879
plastic is just blue uh with copper

593
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,320
and you know the grower was worried

594
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
about rain and

595
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,079
did not had a history of bacterial

596
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,640
diseases and was spraying copper on a

597
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,879
five-day five-day schedule so

598
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,759
when you do have bacterial pathogens

599
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,880
they can be devastating and

600
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,158
control strategies can be limited

601
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
all right

602
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,799
so

603
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,158
if there are questions on bacterial

604
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,918
pathogens otherwise we will have a poll

605
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,080
on early blight

606
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
how often do you see early blight on

607
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,480
your farm

608
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,360
marian abby amara did i miss anything in

609
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
bacteria

610
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,639
while people are answering the poll

611
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,678
hey chris it's abby um i remember that

612
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,199
at one point you were doing

613
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,519
i don't know maybe it was maybe it

614
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
wasn't was it blackrock i don't know if

615
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,879
you did this in tomatoes but you had a

616
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,360
way to know whether the bacteria was

617
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
being brought in on seed more frequently

618
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,079
than

619
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,240
overwintering and i don't know if you

620
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,798
have a sense of that with the tomato

621
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,640
bacterial diseases

622
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,519
yeah so for

623
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,120
we do for bacterial canker um

624
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,679
the the

625
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,558
path the bacterium that causes bacterial

626
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,400
spec they all seem to be extremely it's

627
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,558
really hard to differentiate them

628
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
bacterial canker we do know

629
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,639
that

630
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,600
it's about a 50 50 mix of

631
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,480
the the pathogen overwintering on farm

632
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,558
and new strains coming in each year

633
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,319
and for bacterial spot i have a student

634
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,798
that's working on that right now we

635
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,639
don't have quite enough uh

636
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,558
we don't have quite enough

637
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,360
isolates of the pathogen yet to do that

638
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,839
study

639
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,839
okay okay thanks

640
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,399
early

641
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,359
blight everyone sees it some years

642
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,360
uh in my

643
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,440
in my plots and in my home garden i seem

644
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,079
to see it every year

645
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,480
so

646
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,839
the

647
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,440
trademark symptom

648
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:56,240
of early blight is this target-shaped

649
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,440
lesion on the tomato leaf

650
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,759
and early blight also goes to the tomato

651
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,278
stem

652
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,720
and some people say it looks like a

653
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,240
target on the stem

654
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,159
i have a bit of a harder time always

655
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,640
seeing that but on the leaves you get

656
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,720
these very characteristic target shaped

657
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,200
lesions

658
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,200
when early blight is young

659
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,679
it's really hard to differentiate um

660
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
from other pathogens

661
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,640
and i will show you an example of that

662
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,719
in a second

663
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,960
so when the early when you see early

664
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,558
symptoms there are small dark lesions

665
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,360
which there are several other pathogens

666
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,319
that also cause small dark lesions

667
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,319
including bacterial speck and septoria

668
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,319
the older leaves have these older

669
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,678
lesions are target-shaped

670
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,639
and early blight the fungus that causes

671
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,360
uh this disease the fungus has a kind of

672
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,038
cool name alternaria to monophylla i i

673
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,359
like that one um it survives in the soil

674
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,919
and it will you'll first see it on the

675
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:00,719
lower leaves and it'll splash up from

676
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
the soil onto those lower leaves

677
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
so

678
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,120
uh

679
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,919
rotation is key because the pathogen is

680
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,000
in the soil if you can rotate out of

681
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,559
tomato and

682
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,519
this this particular pathogen can go to

683
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:18,079
potato and there's a super closely

684
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,918
related pathogen that and they can both

685
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,199
sort of go to potato and tomato so

686
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,960
you're going to want to rotate away from

687
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,278
potato and tomato and they're going to

688
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,278
be worse than wet weather because well

689
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,278
pathogens like wet weather but also

690
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,919
you're likely to get that splashing up

691
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:35,119
so in addition to rotation anything you

692
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,278
can do if you have a weed cloth or a

693
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,359
straw mulch or something on the ground

694
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,359
to try to prevent splashing from the

695
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,639
soil up onto the plant that's really

696
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,038
going to help you control early blight

697
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,038
so these are young early blight region

698
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,879
early blight lesions

699
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,278
small dots on a leaf

700
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,559
and they look remarkably similar to

701
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:59,359
these septoria lesions and these

702
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,158
bacterial spec lesions so when someone

703
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,798
brings a leaf like this into my lab i i

704
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,720
can't i can't differentiate the three

705
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,440
when they're that small i actually have

706
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,400
to isolate and and see which pathogen

707
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,400
that we're working with

708
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
early blood as i said is an annual

709
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
problem

710
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,398
um

711
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,398
you'll see lesions as you can see in

712
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,719
this plant starting on the lower leaves

713
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:26,000
but then they'll move up rapidly and

714
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,519
it's that splashing up the plant um from

715
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,679
either overhead watering or or

716
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,000
rain events that really will move it

717
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,000
through the plant quickly and it can it

718
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,759
can take a plant down

719
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,440
and i'm including septoria here we're

720
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,319
gonna i'm gonna talk about management

721
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,399
because they

722
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,200
you manage them both in a similar manner

723
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,678
so

724
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,759
have you guys seen septoria on your farm

725
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,679
septoria leaf spot

726
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,359
is uh

727
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,120
these tiny uh spots here as you saw on

728
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,759
the previous slide

729
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,398
the characteristic lesion that you see

730
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,919
over here on the right hand side is a

731
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:08,719
dark ring with a tan center and tiny

732
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,960
black spots and there's there's nothing

733
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
else that looks like an old septoria

734
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,200
lesion

735
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,839
and

736
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,519
it can be

737
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,158
confusing uh with early blight

738
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,759
especially at some of the the younger

739
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,600
stages and a lot of times you're going

740
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,720
to see both septoria and early blight

741
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,719
together

742
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,360
and then you're it's like i'm not sure

743
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,480
and that's usually because it's both

744
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,678
and i think that shows up in this poll

745
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,360
because a lot of times you might be

746
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,360
seeing it and you're like i'm not sure i

747
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,079
had brown spots on my leaf but i'm not

748
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,918
sure what fungus or what organism was

749
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,439
causing um

750
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,440
uh these these brown spots

751
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,320
so

752
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,919
whoa

753
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,200
sorry about that

754
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,360
there we go

755
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,720
um

756
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,359
septoria leaf spot as i said comes uh it

757
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,278
survives over winter in this in the soil

758
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,678
just like the early blight pathogen

759
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,679
splashes up onto the leaves these are

760
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,278
again those characteristic lesions

761
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,440
they're they're getting a bit older you

762
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,200
can see this tan spots starting to

763
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
develop in the center

764
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
um

765
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,559
the

766
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,079
as i said it's confused with other spots

767
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,960
and the other thing that's tricky about

768
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,240
it is that it's seen mid to late season

769
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,120
which is the time when you're going to

770
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,278
see almost all of the tomato pathogens

771
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,038
showing up so that can make it tricky as

772
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,919
well

773
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,480
much like early blight it

774
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,840
thrives in the wet years as the fungus

775
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,519
splashes from the soil to the lower

776
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,839
leaves um

777
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,918
i was i was visiting a grower and

778
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,119
actually it might have been with abby

779
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,000
um

780
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,158
and there was one field on their farm

781
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,278
that they took us to because they knew

782
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,600
so when i

783
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,880
visit farms people tend to to show me

784
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,959
their most diseased plants and um

785
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,799
this particular field was in a remote

786
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,159
area of the farm and it had been

787
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,240
forgotten about

788
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:11,120
and so no control strategies were used

789
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,079
and the entire field was destroyed

790
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,319
by the combination of septoria and early

791
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,119
blight and you can see in this field

792
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,599
they did have a black plastic mulch and

793
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,759
a straw mulch between the rows and even

794
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,639
with that the fungus was able to move

795
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:29,200
from the soil up onto the plants and

796
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
completely wipe out this field it was a

797
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,240
total loss it was really sad

798
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,359
this is an image of of that field you

799
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,960
can see

800
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,479
they tried to go in and see if they

801
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,319
could harvest anything

802
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,319
but in fact it was a total loss

803
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,319
so managing early blight and septoria

804
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,080
rotation is important scouting is

805
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,599
important because you're going to want

806
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,678
to

807
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,678
see oh i have a lesion right on the

808
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,960
bottom of the plant you can remove those

809
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,159
lower leaves

810
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,038
that will help

811
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,600
and

812
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,440
as soon as you see scout and see that

813
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,959
first lesion if you're going to

814
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,880
implement a

815
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,640
control strategy

816
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,120
whether it's one of the effective

817
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
fungicides

818
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,959
there are

819
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,038
bio controls that from i haven't tested

820
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,558
them but from what i've read have mixed

821
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,158
efficacy you know you're going to want

822
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,319
to do that early on so you're going to

823
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,840
want to scout oh there's a lesion now

824
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,079
it's when i need to really start

825
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,319
focusing on disease control there are

826
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,720
tolerant varieties

827
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,678
the varieties that most growers commonly

828
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,600
grow

829
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,600
because that's what the market wants are

830
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,558
susceptible but there are tolerant

831
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,558
varieties available

832
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,919
all right

833
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,240
that was early blight and septoria

834
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,840
tomato leaf mold

835
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,839
have you guys seen this on your farm

836
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,880
uh my lab didn't only started working on

837
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,640
tomato leaf mall um

838
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,720
five years ago

839
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,679
and uh

840
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,399
it's really because of the increase in

841
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,000
high tunnel tomato production in new

842
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,839
york

843
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,960
that we started working on tomato leaf

844
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,319
mold

845
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,440
and

846
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:14,879
in this group

847
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,120
it seems that most folks thankfully have

848
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,159
not seen tomato leaf mold

849
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,000
um

850
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,679
but the the person who sees it most

851
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,919
years or the people that see it most

852
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,080
years i'm guessing they that you have

853
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,440
some high tunnel tomato production

854
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,839
because that's where we see it most

855
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,840
often

856
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,038
so these are our research high tunnels

857
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,720
and so we were able to do tomato leaf

858
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,839
mold experiments in our research high

859
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,159
tunnels

860
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,759
we could inoculate plants

861
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,278
which i would never want to do on a

862
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,720
grower farm

863
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,200
but we

864
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,159
did several different research projects

865
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,840
on

866
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,080
tomato leaf mold in our high tunnels and

867
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,119
this is kelly inoculating some of our

868
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,359
plants

869
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,759
tomato leaf mold is common in high

870
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,240
tunnels because it likes hot and humid

871
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,919
conditions and it likes cool nights and

872
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,759
that's exactly what you have in a high

873
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,360
tunnel scenario it

874
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,278
if it if you have plants in the field

875
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,038
and it's a rainy season you're probably

876
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,359
not going to see leaf mold it just does

877
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,119
not like the rain nope don't want my

878
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,558
leaves wet which is unusual for a

879
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,798
pathogen

880
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,359
so it likes those hot humid conditions

881
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,599
and it actually needs a very high

882
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,798
humidity to for those spores to

883
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,240
germinate and attack the plant but um no

884
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,798
rain

885
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,480
it can spread rapidly you see on the

886
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,398
upper leaf surface you

887
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,558
surface you see these yellow spots and

888
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,558
then on the lower leaf surface you can

889
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,879
see uh this

890
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,278
brown to gray i think people tend to

891
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,080
call it sort of an olive color colored

892
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,000
uh fuzz those are actually all spores of

893
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,158
the fungus and there are so many spores

894
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,720
that that once it gets started those

895
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,720
spores just can spread like wildfire

896
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,600
through a high tunnel

897
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,798
and we tend to see this mid to late

898
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,639
season

899
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,960
because it does it

900
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,038
the pathogen will survive over the

901
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,120
winter in the high tunnel

902
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,558
on plant debris generally

903
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,799
but it takes a while

904
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,639
for it to get established and then move

905
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,039
throughout the high tunnel during the

906
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,039
season

907
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,240
so how do we control tomato leaf mold

908
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:22,000
well as i said it over winter is in the

909
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,878
tunnel so we remove debris and and i

910
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,719
know

911
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,799
this this can be difficult for growers

912
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,918
but rotating the high tunnel out of

913
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,800
tomato will really help reduce the

914
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,960
incidence of tomato of tomato leaf mold

915
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,879
um

916
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,480
especially since it's surviving in that

917
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,118
in that tunnel

918
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,119
how long chris is one year enough for do

919
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,838
you need more than one no that's a great

920
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,679
question one year at least um from what

921
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,159
i have read we haven't done the

922
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,398
rotational studies but one year should

923
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,280
be enough because that tomato debris

924
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,960
breaks down fairly quickly yeah if if

925
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,640
you have some really big stems it might

926
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,760
take longer but generally one year is

927
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,598
enough

928
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,599
one of the the

929
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,800
i don't know drawbacks is not the right

930
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,200
word but

931
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,720
generally um if you have high tunnels

932
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,799
you might have three or four next to one

933
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,959
another and you can imagine if it's hot

934
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
out and you roll up the sides and you

935
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,000
have this many

936
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,159
spores of the tomato leaf mold fungus in

937
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,039
one tunnel they can spread pretty

938
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,239
rapidly to the one right next door to it

939
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,719
so that

940
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,358
if all of the high tunnels are in a line

941
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,959
it it can be tricky to try to rotate

942
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,480
away or or keep one tunnel um

943
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,838
leaf mold free

944
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,679
uh one of one of the places when i'm

945
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,559
scouting a high tunnel

946
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,199
if uh if i see that there are sun gold

947
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,799
uh fruit which i am a huge fan of the

948
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,039
sun gold tomato

949
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,599
i will go and scout those plants first

950
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,239
because in any given high tunnel the sun

951
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,519
gold is going to be the cultivar that

952
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:01,598
gets the tomato leaf mold first

953
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:04,639
sadly it's incredibly susceptible

954
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,400
so i i did want to show a little bit of

955
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,480
data on our

956
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,639
high tunnel leaf mold trial um i had a

957
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,559
student that recently graduated that did

958
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,239
a lot of work and we made some progress

959
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,838
understanding the leaf mold that we have

960
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,598
here in new york

961
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,199
and there was some concern there are

962
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,039
tomato varieties that are grown in high

963
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,159
tunnels that

964
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,159
have are are sold as resistant to tomato

965
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,078
leaf mold and there was some concern

966
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,199
that the resistance might be breaking

967
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,160
down but in our studies

968
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,879
we

969
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:40,399
we the four cultivars that are targeted

970
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,640
as resistant to tomato leaf mold uh were

971
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,639
resistant in our study as well so in

972
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:49,440
this graph along the x-axis we have the

973
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,920
tomato cultivars that we trialed and we

974
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
rated at four different dates so the the

975
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,400
blue bar is the first rating the orange

976
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,960
bar the second the gray bar the third

977
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,358
and the gold bar the final rating of the

978
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,280
season and on the um

979
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,960
on the y-axis we have

980
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,760
the percent disease um from zero to 100

981
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,199
percent so you can see by the by the

982
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,880
final rating uh some of the cultivars in

983
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,199
our high tunnel had a a lot of disease

984
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,200
but the good news was there were uh

985
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,838
cultivars that did have resistance as

986
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,838
well

987
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,960
so

988
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,280
that was tomato leaf mold chris can i

989
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,240
ask you one more question first

990
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,960
um

991
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,799
could someone plant a resistant tomato

992
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,838
variety instead of rotating out of

993
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
tomatoes all together

994
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:46,480
so if your only focus is tomato leaf

995
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:48,239
malt then yes absolutely

996
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,280
and and

997
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,559
we

998
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,519
we know that the pathogen has been in

999
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,759
high tunnels in new york for a long time

1000
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,320
making lots of spores and we have not

1001
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,640
yet seen the pathogen mutate to overcome

1002
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,480
that host resistance however we also

1003
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,759
know that there are

1004
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,599
other pathogens um soil-borne pathogens

1005
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,480
that uh that that will build up and can

1006
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,039
wipe out a tomato crop so it is good to

1007
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,440
rotate if if you can

1008
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,759
especially to to get away from some of

1009
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,358
the soil pathogens that you might have

1010
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
and some of the soil insects that you

1011
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,119
might have in that high tunnel

1012
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,880
and in

1013
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,800
sort of along those lines for for

1014
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,960
reasons that i'm very curious about but

1015
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,599
do not yet understand

1016
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,400
there's a disease called white mold and

1017
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,800
in tomato and pepper in high tunnels it

1018
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,880
seems to almost be worse

1019
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,519
in high tunnels it survives in the soil

1020
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,519
as well and i i'm i'm really wanting to

1021
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,920
do some studies to try to understand why

1022
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,719
it is that the high tunnel environment

1023
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,240
is worse for for those particular soil

1024
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,199
borne pathogens

1025
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,959
compared to the field environment

1026
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,879
as an aside

1027
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,199
questions to be answered

1028
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,119
so chris i have another question about

1029
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,439
leaf mold can um

1030
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,519
can keeping keeping the air moving in a

1031
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,400
high tunnel is there any kind of

1032
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,559
like um air movement or air

1033
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,519
or humidity management tech techniques

1034
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,119
that can

1035
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,119
can contribute to management

1036
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,000
yeah um

1037
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,039
any you know so that would be spacing of

1038
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,920
rose

1039
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,880
um

1040
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,320
you know when for sure uh

1041
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,880
one of uh

1042
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,000
one of my uh most interesting memories

1043
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,240
of tomato leaf mold um was i was in in

1044
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,320
the north country visiting a grower

1045
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,319
and walking through the tunnel and you

1046
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,640
know tomato plants this was in august

1047
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,480
and they're huge in high tunnels by then

1048
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,319
and the rows were very close together so

1049
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,400
i was actually walking sideways to get

1050
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,720
through the row and when i came out of

1051
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,079
that high tunnel i was completely

1052
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,199
covered in tomato leaf mold fungus

1053
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,079
spores

1054
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,159
and um and and and that just sort of

1055
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,160
reminded me anytime i think about row

1056
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,118
spacing and high tunnels and i talked to

1057
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,279
the grower and you know they said well i

1058
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,640
really want to have as many tomatoes as

1059
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,800
possible because i want the biggest

1060
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:15,199
harvest because you know it

1061
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,440
i need my farm to be profitable

1062
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:21,759
um but reducing those number of rows and

1063
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,880
giving the plants a bit more space

1064
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,680
pruning out to increase the air flow

1065
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,358
within a plant will all help reduce not

1066
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,598
only leaf mold but any of the other

1067
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,920
pathogens that you might have

1068
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,920
thanks

1069
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,480
so i would say five years ago

1070
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,000
i would lead off

1071
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,760
every single

1072
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,280
tomato talk

1073
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,079
with late blight

1074
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
because it was by far and away

1075
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,920
the biggest issue

1076
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,759
for tomato growers in the state of new

1077
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,280
york um

1078
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,319
they were fearful of it um and and just

1079
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,319
thought wow uh if i get late blight

1080
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,440
my crop is wiped out

1081
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:04,318
and

1082
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,880
and

1083
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:10,559
over the past five to maybe seven years

1084
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,599
the amount of late blight that we've

1085
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,318
seen

1086
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,039
in tomato in new york or even in potato

1087
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,599
in new york has really declined to the

1088
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,000
point where i am now uh including this

1089
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,760
and at the at the as the last disease

1090
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,199
that i talk about

1091
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,960
um

1092
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,199
which is interesting

1093
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,280
so people see it some years

1094
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,598
um

1095
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,119
if you have late blight

1096
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,280
it's definitely

1097
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,280
going to impact your your farm

1098
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,480
in this slide i i wanted to show a

1099
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,280
diversity of the symptoms that we might

1100
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,559
see

1101
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,880
in a young tomato fruit you're going to

1102
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,199
see a lesion like this brown lesion on

1103
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,119
the left hand side

1104
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,239
you frequently don't see

1105
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,318
as many of the pathogen spores

1106
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,039
on the younger

1107
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,358
very green fruit so you'll see a brown

1108
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,039
um lesion out like the picture here on

1109
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,239
the left

1110
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,480
this leaf here in the center is an image

1111
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,838
that i frequently use

1112
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,000
because it's it's like the

1113
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,078
characteristic image of tomato late

1114
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,679
light that just

1115
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,800
millions of spores of the pathogen that

1116
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,318
show up on the underside of the leaf

1117
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,720
and will

1118
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:32,480
their wind barn fly through the air and

1119
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,879
can cause

1120
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,519
a huge amount of disease in a really a

1121
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,800
relatively short period of time

1122
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,800
the pathogen can also attack the stem of

1123
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,359
the plant and you can see here on a

1124
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,240
tomato stem here's a leaf lesion here's

1125
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,199
a stem lesion with so many of those

1126
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,799
white

1127
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,960
spores on the stem

1128
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,359
and then in a ripe fruit

1129
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,960
this is sort of the extreme close up but

1130
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,598
again you can see

1131
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,599
that the pathogen is just really

1132
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,160
devastating that

1133
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,160
ripe fruit

1134
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:11,519
so late light is caused by a water mold

1135
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,400
it looks like a fungus

1136
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:17,119
but it's actually it's quite

1137
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,280
evolutionarily different from a fungus

1138
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,440
and there are a couple of things

1139
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,079
that make that really important to

1140
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,480
understand if you're growing tomatoes

1141
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,519
and one of those is that

1142
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,880
um this particular uh well water molds

1143
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,880
in general will go completely crazy

1144
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,800
in cool wet weather

1145
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,640
and in this image that i have here on

1146
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,920
the left

1147
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,000
at first you look and you think oh

1148
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,680
that's a healthy tomato plant but when

1149
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,039
you look at it closer

1150
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,078
you can see

1151
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:51,199
that there are lesions on the leaves of

1152
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,800
these tomato plants

1153
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:57,118
and

1154
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,480
this is probably not yet

1155
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,640
close to five percent of that tomato

1156
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,679
plant has some light blight on it

1157
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,559
and

1158
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,919
my lab has done quite a few studies that

1159
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,559
once

1160
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,960
that tomato plant gets to five percent

1161
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,920
disease which is really not very much

1162
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,920
it's

1163
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,039
nearly impossible

1164
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,039
to control this pathogen especially if

1165
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,838
it rains

1166
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:25,039
so

1167
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,199
that's why

1168
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,039
you know we're all so nervous about late

1169
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,199
blight you know if you have five percent

1170
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:34,239
bacterial disease you can still think

1171
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:37,358
about slowing it down but but wow it's

1172
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:40,479
really hard to slow lay blight down

1173
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,239
um the lesions can grow really rapidly

1174
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,760
it's so common to hear people say you

1175
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,679
know i was in the field yesterday and i

1176
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,800
didn't see it and today the plants are

1177
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,679
dead

1178
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,400
and

1179
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,239
and they can grow really rapidly it can

1180
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,960
spread fast um

1181
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:58,479
and it will attack as i showed earlier

1182
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,400
the leaves the fruit and the stems

1183
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,240
back to that characteristic white

1184
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,318
sporulation

1185
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,118
and i thought i would spend a second uh

1186
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,119
talking about that because this is a

1187
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,680
close-up of those spores

1188
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,440
and what they do is in the they're

1189
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,679
formed overnight

1190
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,720
and in the morning when the humidity

1191
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:21,679
decreases the sun comes out those spores

1192
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,239
actually twist in the lower humidity and

1193
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,639
twist their way right off the leaf into

1194
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,399
the wind of the morning and they spread

1195
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,318
to other leaves in the same plant other

1196
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,480
plants in the same field and the fields

1197
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,358
next door

1198
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,480
we know that we need to worry about

1199
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:42,480
where is that original late blight

1200
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,599
inoculum coming from and we also know

1201
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,719
that

1202
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,039
the pathogen is is not very good at

1203
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,639
surviving the winter here in new york

1204
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,119
which is a really great thing about

1205
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,358
winter it kills slate light for the most

1206
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,358
part

1207
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,960
one of the ways that it will survive the

1208
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,960
winter here in new york is in potato

1209
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,639
tubers that are not harvested if a

1210
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,440
potato field got late light this

1211
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,960
pathogen goes to both tomato and potato

1212
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,000
also petunia

1213
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,240
and this is a potato tuber that is

1214
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,280
infected with the late blight pathogen

1215
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:19,598
if this tuber sprouts that new sprout

1216
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,640
will have light blight and it can spread

1217
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,640
so it's really important sanitation is

1218
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:28,400
so critical for this particular pathogen

1219
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,000
i wanted to highlight i encourage you

1220
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,240
all to go to the website called

1221
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,880
usablite.org

1222
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:37,358
um it has lots of resources on lake

1223
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,599
blight and you can sign up for text

1224
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:43,039
messages that will actually tell you if

1225
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,760
the pathogen has been identified in your

1226
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,800
in in our region of new york in addition

1227
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,200
to that

1228
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,920
if we identify late blight in in new

1229
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,399
york state any of us we push that out

1230
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,838
through social media and all of our

1231
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,838
weekly newsletters

1232
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,839
late blight is somewhat unique among pla

1233
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:08,400
amongst plant pathogens because

1234
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:10,960
uh it's characterized by by strains so

1235
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,639
you saw all of those spores those spores

1236
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,280
are all the same strain they're all

1237
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,598
identical and if the pathogen

1238
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,440
overwinters in that potato tuber and

1239
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,039
comes back the next year it's still the

1240
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,039
exact same strain

1241
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,599
and since

1242
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:26,558
2011

1243
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:30,720
we have had the same strain in the state

1244
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,160
of new york and its name is us-23

1245
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,159
and there are some really interesting

1246
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,639
things about this strain which i think

1247
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,838
is why we have not seen late blight as

1248
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,679
aggressive as we have we had maybe um

1249
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,880
five to ten years ago

1250
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,960
it's sensitive uh to the fungicides that

1251
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,280
can be used to control it

1252
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,358
it's more aggressive on tomato than

1253
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,319
potato so you're less likely to get

1254
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,519
those overwintering potato tubers

1255
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,599
and

1256
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:00,079
a nice thing about it is we've done

1257
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,559
studies that show that copper can

1258
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,880
control this particular strain if the

1259
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,599
copper is applied early

1260
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,480
so even though we have not had much late

1261
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,160
light recently we still need to be

1262
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,400
really vigilant

1263
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,598
and the last thing that i wanted to show

1264
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,838
um was that there are some resistant uh

1265
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,119
some tomato varieties that are resistant

1266
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:22,318
to late light

1267
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,800
and

1268
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,639
this picture of the variety trial that

1269
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,359
we had

1270
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,759
these are individual plots here and

1271
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:32,558
those plants are flat out dead

1272
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,520
but

1273
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,599
you can see that there are plots where

1274
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,519
the plants are still alive

1275
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,440
and

1276
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,480
that's really exciting

1277
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,720
because

1278
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,119
if if we know if

1279
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,039
let's say 2022 we have a horrible

1280
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,280
outbreak of late light and we think that

1281
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,079
there will be late blight in 2023 as

1282
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,319
well

1283
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,160
you could plant some of these resistant

1284
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,239
tomato cultivars knowing that even if

1285
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,078
there was light blight you would get a

1286
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,838
tomato crop it might not be your

1287
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,760
favorite cultivar that you've ever eaten

1288
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,199
in your whole life but you would get a

1289
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,480
tomato crop

1290
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,318
and um

1291
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,719
the the genes

1292
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,599
are known that enable this resistance

1293
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:17,279
they're called ph2 and ph3

1294
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,079
and here are some of the um varieties

1295
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,119
that

1296
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,720
are resistant to lake light and it's you

1297
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,400
know some of them are are ones that are

1298
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,519
now um grown

1299
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,838
so

1300
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,920
we were really happy to see that some

1301
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:34,318
um tomato varieties were holding up

1302
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,760
against the most common strain of lake

1303
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,558
light

1304
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,480
so

1305
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,200
controlling light blight

1306
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,639
using those resistant varieties scouting

1307
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:45,439
is key

1308
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:47,759
you have to catch that so early

1309
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,720
um especially if it's a cool and wet

1310
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,359
season

1311
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:53,439
um if you're going to use uh fungicides

1312
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,960
we there are effective fungicides

1313
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,159
available

1314
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,720
rotating

1315
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,639
fungicides is key as i said copper has

1316
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,480
some efficacy

1317
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,558
importantly if you think you have late

1318
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,119
light let one of us know we'll get a

1319
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,920
sample and um we'll make sure that it's

1320
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,838
late light and uh help with any

1321
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,240
issues might you might have in in

1322
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,719
controlling the pathogen

1323
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,719
it'll spread quickly to other plants and

1324
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,838
and to other fields so remove and

1325
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,919
destroy

1326
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,000
uh infected plants as rapidly as

1327
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,760
possible

1328
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,519
so we're back to the best way to control

1329
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,760
plant diseases

1330
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:32,719
cultural practices are your first and

1331
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,720
best defense i hope i've outlined some

1332
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:35,838
of the cultural practices that you can

1333
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:37,199
use

1334
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,599
um

1335
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,279
and with that i will thank the people in

1336
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,920
my lab that did the work

1337
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,280
the growers that led us onto their farms

1338
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,680
my cce and ipm colleagues and all of our

1339
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,480
work is funded both by the state of new

1340
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:57,279
york and by the usda

1341
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,280
so thank you and i will take questions

1342
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,079
thank you so much chris um yes if

1343
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,239
anybody has any questions can you please

1344
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,240
put them in the chat um i have a quick

1345
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,000
one to get us started with um i know we

1346
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:12,000
had a question yesterday someone was

1347
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,920
asking about when they see diseases um

1348
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,358
it's usually too late do you have

1349
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,800
thresholds for the different diseases

1350
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,039
that people should be looking for when

1351
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,240
do they need to act

1352
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:25,199
yeah there are there are thresholds for

1353
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,519
many of the many of the diseases um

1354
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,439
those would be those would be

1355
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:32,159
listed in in um

1356
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,119
the vegetable guidelines but generally

1357
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,159
um

1358
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,039
you know

1359
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,719
um

1360
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,759
generally it's

1361
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,919
well so if if it's on your farm if it's

1362
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,720
a bacterial disease or

1363
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,159
early blight septoria

1364
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,078
i would say

1365
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,838
as soon as you see lesions in the plant

1366
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,480
that's going to be your threshold if

1367
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,639
it's late light your threshold is if

1368
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,000
it's in the county

1369
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,480
right so

1370
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,159
you might you you hope that your farm is

1371
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,159
not the first farm in the county to have

1372
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,000
lab lights but that's one of the reasons

1373
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,239
that we really want everyone to scout

1374
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,199
and let us know because once there is a

1375
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,679
farm in the county or a nearby county

1376
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,679
that has uh late blight that's going to

1377
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,558
be our threshold to start thinking about

1378
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,558
the best management

1379
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:21,279
strategies

1380
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,200
all right great um are there any

1381
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,640
questions i don't see any yet in the

1382
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,919
chat if anybody wants to write in their

1383
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,440
questions or

1384
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,039
more than happy to unmute yourself if

1385
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,679
you would like you can ask questions too

1386
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,440
so i had a question about um

1387
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,759
i think this is uh

1388
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,960
in relationship to high tunnels but uh

1389
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,760
if you plant spinach in the in the fall

1390
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,639
um after tomatoes and harvest in the

1391
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,319
spring harvest that spinach uh and then

1392
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,078
plow under

1393
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,000
and you plant again the next season is

1394
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,039
that considered a rotation so you know

1395
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,559
you took your tomatoes out in september

1396
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,318
you put spinach in

1397
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,359
and then you want to put tomatoes back

1398
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,480
in in

1399
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:04,000
april is that considered a rotation and

1400
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,119
you know

1401
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,920
i think it i i my answer would be no

1402
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,880
um

1403
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,880
you really need a season you know a year

1404
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,720
a season out of tomato

1405
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,680
it is possible with the tilling if

1406
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,759
you're really getting rid of all the

1407
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,358
leaf debris that you might not have a

1408
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,720
leaf mold issue

1409
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,039
but in terms of some of the soil

1410
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,959
pathogens i would say stay a whole year

1411
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:30,318
out

1412
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,400
ah so 40 sungold tomatoes in your high

1413
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,239
tunnel first off uh please invite me

1414
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,240
over

1415
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,439
i love them um

1416
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,558
uh

1417
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,039
and uh recommendations to avoid leaf

1418
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,480
mold so um

1419
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,000
uh you know that air spacing is critical

1420
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,960
and um

1421
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,199
uh

1422
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,400
the most effective thing

1423
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,078
we've yeah so first air spacing second

1424
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,000
scout

1425
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,240
be on the lookout and when you scout it

1426
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,760
it's actually it's actually fairly easy

1427
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,318
when you're looking across the high

1428
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,520
tunnel look for any anytime you see a

1429
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,599
yellow spot

1430
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:09,280
and yellow yellow spots can be caused by

1431
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,800
a lot of things but one of them is leaf

1432
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,720
mold so then you see that yellow spot

1433
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,318
you flip the leaf over and see if you

1434
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,118
have that gray mold

1435
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:16,800
um

1436
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,720
and then uh

1437
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,318
the other thing is that if if you are

1438
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:23,439
planning um

1439
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:26,318
to use a control strategy you're going

1440
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,679
to want to start as soon as you see that

1441
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:30,880
first lesion

1442
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:33,679
and so scouting is really really key

1443
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,358
but yeah that that making sure that

1444
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,719
you're

1445
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,880
pruning you know

1446
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,519
leaves the lower leaves get rid of those

1447
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,280
so there's there's more air flow and um

1448
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,280
that that should be yeah that should be

1449
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,720
good

1450
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:53,160
abby is also yes if you if you

1451
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:53,159
yes share them with the ipm house

1452
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,960
so chris i had a

1453
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,599
question about um

1454
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,599
fungicide strategy for

1455
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,519
late blight because

1456
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,760
i um

1457
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:09,199
i know that

1458
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,520
so mostly it's us 23 and so

1459
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,919
going in with rid you know with

1460
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,280
methanoxam is probably the right thing

1461
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,318
to do

1462
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,400
um

1463
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,558
sometimes i think growers want to wait

1464
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,440
and find out if it's

1465
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,480
uh us 23 but would you recommend that

1466
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,240
they just

1467
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,440
go ahead with the methanoxin whether

1468
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:32,558
they know or not if it's susceptible

1469
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,318
yeah so if the if the

1470
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,599
late light is in the field yeah then yes

1471
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:38,558
absolutely

1472
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,680
um

1473
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,240
because

1474
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:44,000
in in 11 years

1475
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,759
the predominant

1476
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,760
uh late blight we've seen has been

1477
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,160
sensitive to methanoxin so absolutely

1478
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,760
and then you also mentioned um fungicide

1479
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:57,118
rotation

1480
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,240
so i know that so in general is there

1481
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,599
like a

1482
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:04,239
class of fungicides that's you know

1483
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,519
better in rotation with methanoxin like

1484
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:08,558
should it be

1485
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,559
um trans laminar or

1486
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,319
what what what is it about a good

1487
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:17,760
rotation fungicide would you recommend

1488
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,798
yeah so i think that

1489
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,760
uh

1490
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,119
translator yes um

1491
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,119
the

1492
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,079
the those fungicides that are effective

1493
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,559
on

1494
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:34,640
the oh my seats you know the

1495
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:37,920
um the revis the presidios the

1496
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:42,159
arandis right um they tend to be really

1497
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,960
expensive and so you want to use those

1498
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,920
you know

1499
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,920
on a limited basis because we don't want

1500
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,159
resistance but also because they're very

1501
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,240
expensive um so i think that um uh

1502
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:58,480
alternating um something that's

1503
00:56:54,239 --> 00:57:00,639
translaminar um and affordable with

1504
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,039
uh you know something something that's

1505
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:07,118
more expensive is the best strategy and

1506
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:10,000
particularly with this um this u.s 23 we

1507
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,079
have seen success with that um so but

1508
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,239
those you know the the rand man the

1509
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,519
presidio the revis the

1510
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:19,039
the orondis are all very effective okay

1511
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,798
thanks

1512
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,318
um chris you have one more question but

1513
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,639
i also know you have to hop off so if

1514
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:27,759
you have a chance to answer it yep

1515
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,920
biologicals yeah so so we uh biological

1516
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,839
fungicides for bacteria we have trials

1517
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,440
every year um

1518
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:34,798
and uh

1519
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,920
we had

1520
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:36,880
last year

1521
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,760
the

1522
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,960
the we had the phage that i talked about

1523
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,359
um we also had double nickel and um

1524
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,119
double nickel after after copper double

1525
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,239
nickel actually worked the best and

1526
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,519
that's uh

1527
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,919
bacillus

1528
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:54,880
and um that that was effective we have

1529
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,200
tried regalia against bacterial diseases

1530
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,599
and we have not seen any efficacy we've

1531
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:02,078
also tried oxidate

1532
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,960
we tried lifeguard we've tried a lot of

1533
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,200
different

1534
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,240
products and

1535
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,719
so far

1536
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:12,078
you know bacteria are really hard but um

1537
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,439
so far um the the double nickel uh we've

1538
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,039
seen the the

1539
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,200
best sort of

1540
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,759
it not as good as copper but in that

1541
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:22,558
next best category and we'll be trying

1542
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,839
actually additional um biologicals this

1543
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,200
year i'm actually i'm hopeful that you

1544
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:29,838
know that there is now a group of

1545
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,000
scientists that are studying you know

1546
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:34,318
what can really survive on that leaf

1547
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,920
surface and you know

1548
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,920
if we can really learn about what

1549
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,639
survives on the leaf surface or how do

1550
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,039
we enable those biologicals to survive

1551
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,358
on the leaf surface i think i think that

1552
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,599
will really help propel

1553
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,759
biologicals um

1554
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,798
into a you know into a place where we

1555
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,640
can

1556
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:55,280
we we need to find ways to help the

1557
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,639
biological survive uh and out compete

1558
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,280
that pathogen

1559
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,039
great so we're going to be going over

1560
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,200
nutrition and fertility management for

1561
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,960
tomatoes uh

1562
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,318
in general and then as i go through the

1563
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,240
talk i'm going to try to be pointing out

1564
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,639
how it relates to ipm

1565
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:13,439
so as we go through this feel free to

1566
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,960
put questions in the chat um

1567
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,079
we'll get to those questions at the end

1568
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,480
of the session

1569
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,240
so here we go

1570
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,440
fundamentals of nutrition is a place i

1571
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,519
always like to start so we're going to

1572
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,838
go over the plant needs the relationship

1573
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,838
of ph and soil fertility and then also

1574
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,719
uptake inhibition

1575
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,880
so

1576
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:33,039
what does the tomato need this is pulled

1577
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,318
straight out of the the recommendations

1578
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,400
or guidelines that cornell puts out and

1579
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,798
right across the top we'll see that it's

1580
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,720
based for soil for transplants in the

1581
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:44,159
background we don't really

1582
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,759
i don't know anyone who does direct

1583
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,358
seeding in new york

1584
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,839
we have bare ground transplants and then

1585
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:52,318
we also have separate recommendations

1586
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:54,078
for transplants in plastic mulch and the

1587
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,318
reason they're separated out is not

1588
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,079
because the overall tour recommendation

1589
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:59,358
is different that is the same like you

1590
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,079
see in the blue

1591
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:04,000
um it's because

1592
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,039
what you do with broadcasts and disking

1593
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,719
is different

1594
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,558
when plants are on plastic mulch they

1595
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,759
very often have trickle irrigation

1596
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,680
underneath

1597
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,520
and so we're going to spoon feed those

1598
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,798
plants throughout the season that's why

1599
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:19,679
you're broadcasting less in

1600
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:22,400
right across the top we see a range of

1601
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:25,679
nutrient levels for potassium

1602
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,720
and for phosphorus

1603
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:28,239
the

1604
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,480
number the largest number that's what

1605
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,318
the plant needs the medium and high

1606
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,039
that's adjusting that recommendation

1607
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:37,279
downwards based on your soil test

1608
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:40,960
so that's how you read these if you have

1609
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,880
and i've said soil test right so

1610
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,480
how much do you add

1611
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,160
very much so the management of your

1612
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,079
fertility should always be based on the

1613
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,358
soil test you want to be testing your

1614
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,440
soil

1615
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,519
at least every three years if you've

1616
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,358
made some sort of change to soil either

1617
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,400
adding a lot of amendments

1618
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:00,960
or maybe you had the field manured

1619
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,079
last summer you know if your early crop

1620
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,559
of peas came off you had to feel ignored

1621
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:09,599
or if you've done a lot of ph adjustment

1622
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,079
you want to retest so every lab will

1623
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,760
have a slightly different extraction

1624
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,240
method the important thing is that

1625
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,319
you're looking at the pounds per acre or

1626
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,798
the sufficiency bars

1627
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,798
and then if you switch from labs to lab

1628
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:25,599
until the numbers the values may not

1629
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,199
line up but the sufficiency bars will

1630
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,640
so

1631
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,279
very quickly we can look to see that

1632
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:33,759
this field is very high in phosphorus

1633
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,079
it's high in potassium very high in

1634
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,520
calcium and high in magnesium overall

1635
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,839
pretty good fertility

1636
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:41,119
uh four things you should check out in

1637
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:42,639
addition to those bars you should check

1638
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,920
out the soil ph

1639
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,159
that's going to give you a lot of

1640
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,240
information about what nutrients may or

1641
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,838
may not be available you want to check

1642
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,919
out the percent organic matter because

1643
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:54,000
that's related to

1644
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,720
so many things but in terms of fertility

1645
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,719
it's related mostly to nitrogen cycling

1646
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,959
and it's related to the soil's ability

1647
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,519
to hold on store nutrients and then give

1648
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,358
them back up later

1649
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,759
your soil test should always go in with

1650
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,880
a name the series name of your soil if

1651
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,319
it goes in with the name then the

1652
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,000
recommendations coming out are going to

1653
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,759
be better tailored to your soil the soil

1654
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,239
name tells the lab if you have a clay

1655
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,400
soil a sandy soil something in between

1656
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,399
and then at the bottom the lab is giving

1657
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,200
recommendations for what you add you'll

1658
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,720
see that labs almost always

1659
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:28,558
recommend 50 pounds of phosphorus for a

1660
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:30,798
tomato crop

1661
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,559
and we'll get into why that is

1662
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:33,440
even though the phosphorus is very very

1663
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,119
high

1664
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,159
lots of labs will recommend that because

1665
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,640
they're trying to overcome a temporary

1666
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,480
deficiency caused by cold soils

1667
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,719
and that's a management decision that

1668
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,240
you know along an ipm standpoint might

1669
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:50,879
not always make sense

1670
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:53,279
so we always want to aim to optimize

1671
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,760
things that ipm is just as much about

1672
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,839
prevention as it is about

1673
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,680
uh sustainability right and so

1674
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,798
optimizing your ph and fertility makes a

1675
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,558
ton of sense to do that so i'll start

1676
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,960
with this little graphic down here this

1677
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,599
is a barrel it's a very common analogy

1678
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,318
for how you think about fertility and

1679
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,400
what's limiting your crop every stave in

1680
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:15,679
the barrel is a different nutrient along

1681
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,599
the front they've written the

1682
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,118
macronutrients along the back they've

1683
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,480
written the micronutrients and inside

1684
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,039
you fill it up with water and the water

1685
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,440
is your yield potential

1686
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,039
your yield in terms of nutrition is only

1687
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,639
going to be able to go as high as your

1688
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,079
most limiting nutrient and that's where

1689
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,400
the water is spilling out in this case

1690
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,400
it's potassium i particularly like this

1691
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,838
barrel because oftentimes i think in

1692
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,680
tomatoes our yield and our quality is

1693
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,679
more limited by potassium than by

1694
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:43,519
anything else

1695
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:45,598
so when you have fertility that's too

1696
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,599
low either your your gross fertility so

1697
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,160
that's your overall

1698
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,160
plant fertility or your specific

1699
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,759
fertility of one nutrient you end up

1700
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,759
with plants that are stressed in some

1701
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,280
way and stress plants are more

1702
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,359
susceptible to diseases and insects

1703
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,280
insufficient levels of fertility for

1704
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,358
specific nutrients can often interfere

1705
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,519
with fruiting and fruit quality

1706
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:09,440
and this idea of sufficiency also

1707
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,280
applies to water stress so that's going

1708
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,280
to mean that yes we're talking about

1709
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,200
fertility but if your plants are

1710
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,798
constantly going through drought

1711
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,558
flooding cycles

1712
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,719
they're not functioning very well and so

1713
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:24,240
you've created an artificial

1714
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:27,358
temporary inability to get nutrients

1715
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:29,838
in terms of ph being too low

1716
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:32,000
we often find that when the ph drops the

1717
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,358
macronutrients become unavailable

1718
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,960
they're present in the soil but the

1719
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:36,960
plant can't get them

1720
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,318
and that the micronutrient availability

1721
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,720
in the soil goes way up and that can

1722
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,558
cause some toxicity problems

1723
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:44,480
on the flip side if we're running too

1724
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,440
much infertility too high very fertile

1725
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,599
soils

1726
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,358
yes the plants are doing really well but

1727
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,039
as you continue to put more fertilizer

1728
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,679
into that soil you're really wasting

1729
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,920
money especially this year fertilizer

1730
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,519
costs were up 80 to 100 percent over

1731
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,358
last year in western new york and that

1732
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:02,318
was as of mid-february they've continued

1733
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:04,078
to go up this is not the year to be

1734
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,838
excessively applying fertilizer from an

1735
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,160
economic standpoint

1736
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,679
um if we get too much of certain

1737
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,679
nutrients we can start seeing some

1738
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,159
uptake problems caused by other things

1739
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,239
so this is where we start to see some

1740
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,318
inhibition and some competition

1741
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:21,598
one example of this is if you are

1742
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:23,119
fertilizing very heavily with a nh4 plus

1743
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,160
so an ammonium

1744
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,480
style fertilizer the ammonium

1745
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,920
is in competition with potassium for

1746
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,960
uptake in the soil

1747
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,039
and

1748
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,079
if you give your plants a giant slug of

1749
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,319
ammonium you can cause a temporary

1750
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:41,280
decrease in the availability and uptake

1751
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:43,599
of potassium and a temporary

1752
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,760
insufficiency in your plants instead if

1753
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,960
you're feeding with nitrate no three

1754
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,640
minus

1755
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,559
format the plant uses that much more

1756
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:52,078
efficiently it's not competing for

1757
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,599
uptake

1758
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,440
i'm a weed scientist

1759
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:57,039
i always look at how can we control

1760
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,119
weeds with our ipm

1761
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,799
sorry with our ipm toolbox

1762
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,200
and one of the easiest things we can do

1763
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:05,920
is not feed them

1764
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:08,078
weeds love fertility and there's so much

1765
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,838
better using it than most of our crops

1766
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,200
and so they are hoarding it in

1767
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:12,719
especially pigweeds they're going to

1768
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,838
collect more nutrition than they can

1769
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,078
possibly

1770
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,279
use and they hold it so other plants can

1771
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,839
have it but they're also growing really

1772
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,880
big selling lots of seed so

1773
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:24,558
it's a it's a strong ipm tactic um too

1774
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,920
much fertility can favor certain pests

1775
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,920
and diseases i'll give examples of that

1776
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,280
later it also interferes with brooding

1777
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,599
and fruit quality and

1778
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,559
environmentally irresponsible

1779
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,559
if we look at ph as ph gets too high we

1780
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,160
tend to see micronutrients they're in

1781
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,359
the soil but they're no longer available

1782
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:41,519
to the plants and we start to see

1783
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,440
deficiencies this is really common for

1784
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,759
manganese it's common for zinc and it's

1785
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,318
common for iron and the place that we

1786
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,319
see those problems is in the transplant

1787
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,199
production stage when we're not actually

1788
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:52,239
using

1789
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,679
soil

1790
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,639
when we're using some sort of starter

1791
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:58,078
mix the ph rises in those and we start

1792
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,279
seeing

1793
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,760
yellow in the new shoots slow growth out

1794
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,240
diminished leaf size those are micro

1795
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,160
nutrient deficiencies in the transplants

1796
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,358
because the ph of the growing media has

1797
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,358
gotten too high

1798
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,199
actual micronutrient deficiencies in the

1799
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,038
field are very rare

1800
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,480
outside i've never seen it it does

1801
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,000
happen in tunnels from time to time

1802
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,480
because the ph of the soil has gotten

1803
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,480
too high

1804
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,319
so i keep talking about ph and nutrient

1805
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,679
availability this is the chart that

1806
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:27,838
shows it across the bottom we've got the

1807
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:32,239
ph of the soil and each of these

1808
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:34,639
different colored bars is a nutrient

1809
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,919
the top set up through magnesium right

1810
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:37,519
about here halfway down those are the

1811
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,119
macronutrients below that are the

1812
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:41,838
micronutrients

1813
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:44,720
and you can see most of our tomato crops

1814
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:48,239
most recommendations say around 6.5

1815
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:50,480
and at 6.5 the width of the band that's

1816
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:52,639
available to the plants really matches

1817
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,039
how much that they need and so this is

1818
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:56,558
why we're aiming at 6.5 it naturally

1819
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,880
balances the amount of nutrition that

1820
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:02,160
the plants need against the availability

1821
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,160
of those nutrients in the soil

1822
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,280
we can have all the fertility we need

1823
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,200
but if the plants can't get at its it

1824
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,240
doesn't matter so i always like to look

1825
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:14,399
at what could be inhibiting the uptake

1826
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,079
i keep talking about tunnels because a

1827
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,158
lot of tomatoes end up being grown

1828
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,399
inside so it's very common in tunnels

1829
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:22,479
that we get an accumulation of salts

1830
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,158
and they rise up and they're going in

1831
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,959
with

1832
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,318
manure's base compost they're going in

1833
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,719
with

1834
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,960
poultry based fertility pellets they're

1835
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,198
going in with our liquid fertilizers

1836
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,279
those rise up through the soils water

1837
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,039
evaporates leaving the salts and salts

1838
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,719
they change the osmotic pressure and

1839
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,399
they start inhibiting the roots ability

1840
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,480
to pick up nutrients

1841
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,399
uh the other thing in the field

1842
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:49,198
compaction is huge and so this is a

1843
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:51,039
giant wet spot someone decided i really

1844
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,960
have to drive through this i can't find

1845
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,719
another way around and just compacted

1846
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,640
the soil

1847
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,239
you have already had drainage issues

1848
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,000
you're just going to keep on causing

1849
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,559
more drainage issues and more uptake

1850
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,640
problems and so a lot of times fertility

1851
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,839
problems will chase water issues or

1852
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,838
chase compaction issues

1853
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,119
other things that inhibit nutrition

1854
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,039
fertility from an ipm standpoint

1855
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:18,079
if i'm seeing a fertilizer fertility

1856
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,479
problem and it's not uniform okay

1857
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:22,960
fertility problem is caused by feeding

1858
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,278
our uniform across your field

1859
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,560
um if it's not uniform then i want to

1860
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,920
check out the roots in that area

1861
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,279
especially it's kind of like a circular

1862
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,440
pattern

1863
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,960
this is a nice healthy tomato plant

1864
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,879
in case you haven't dug up roots of one

1865
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,158
recently that's what you want but things

1866
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,838
like nematodes can have a big impact on

1867
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,158
the apparent

1868
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,318
nutrition status of your plant so can

1869
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,479
root rots

1870
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,039
freezerium and verticillium are two

1871
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,318
wilts we see verticillium sometimes in

1872
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:52,880
high tunnels

1873
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,800
uh it's oftentimes because we're seeing

1874
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,480
different heirlooms being grown in there

1875
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,039
that don't have the genetic resistance

1876
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,198
to it ferticilium is going to darken up

1877
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,640
the veins and so we test for it by

1878
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,238
splitting the veins if you've ever

1879
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,560
raised an eggplant you will know what

1880
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,959
versilium what will does it takes out

1881
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,560
half a leaf or one branch with wilting

1882
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,198
and yellowing and then scorching

1883
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,440
fusarium will is more of a generalized

1884
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:16,479
yellowing that eventually progresses to

1885
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:18,479
a scorch

1886
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:21,759
and a wilty plant this can be confused

1887
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:23,439
sometimes for a nitrogen deficiency

1888
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,760
both of these will inhibit how well the

1889
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:29,119
plants functioning so you get a

1890
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,600
appearance of a nutrient deficiency

1891
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,279
any questions at this point

1892
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,640
i can't see the chat so are we good

1893
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:38,479
marion so far so good yep okay

1894
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,159
so the other thing with optimizing is

1895
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,399
the timing and the ratios of what you're

1896
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:45,839
feeding so plants really are they are

1897
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:47,839
feed me now they have a generalized

1898
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,159
growth curve and their growth curve

1899
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,719
follows the uptake curve right so in

1900
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,799
general it's this s-shaped curve they

1901
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,719
have this lag phase when they're little

1902
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,560
a rapid growth phase when they have a

1903
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,198
high nutrient demand and then their

1904
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,679
nutrient demand levels off

1905
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,359
so let's say this is nitrogen we have

1906
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,199
these little baby transplants they're

1907
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:08,158
growing but they're not really taking

1908
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:10,719
off yet

1909
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:12,238
we get into the quick vigorous growth

1910
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:14,640
phase that's when you want to time your

1911
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,198
nitrogen feed right here this is a

1912
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,360
reason why the recommendations for

1913
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:20,479
tomatoes under plastic

1914
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:22,479
said that you're going to cut your

1915
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:23,839
fertility back because we're planting it

1916
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:25,359
you know under plastic we often have

1917
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,199
drip and you're spoon feeding the whole

1918
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:28,960
purpose of spoon feeding is not to waste

1919
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:30,960
your fertility down here

1920
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,119
is to feed it when you have much more

1921
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,039
fertilizer use efficiency

1922
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,800
and target the plants in their

1923
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,960
developmental stage where they need that

1924
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,880
so if you miss these growth curves you

1925
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,719
could be stressing your plants if you

1926
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,159
give a lot of your nitrogen broadcast in

1927
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,319
the field not only are you feeding your

1928
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,238
weeds you're also increasing the chance

1929
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,319
that that's going to leach out with with

1930
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,319
spring rains and that translates to

1931
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:55,840
stress loss yield

1932
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,920
if you miss the shift in the potassium

1933
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,079
uptake needs then you're going to be

1934
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,000
leading to poor fruit quality and so

1935
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,079
potassium has a delayed shift we'll

1936
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,238
switch to the other side here talk about

1937
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,960
balance in the center

1938
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:10,559
tomato plants when they're young you

1939
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,480
want to be feeding primarily for

1940
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,960
nitrogen management for npk you're

1941
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:17,039
feeding mostly for nitrogen management

1942
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,119
as they begin flowering you're feeding

1943
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,279
that plant for potassium management they

1944
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:23,359
have a much greater physiological need

1945
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:25,439
as a flower as they set fruit and need

1946
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,119
to load sugar into those fruit if you

1947
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,319
miss that shift

1948
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:30,238
that's where we tend to see a lot of

1949
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,920
fruit quality issues begin to develop

1950
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,000
and that's where we have problems

1951
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,279
particularly with determined tomatoes

1952
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,359
where they go through their first

1953
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,800
fruiting and they're fruit very heavy

1954
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,559
but then they really peter off

1955
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,560
throughout the season and struggle to

1956
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,600
keep those plants going throughout the

1957
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,199
year

1958
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,400
um the other ways you want to balance

1959
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:48,079
you want to make sure that your macros

1960
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,238
and micros are balanced

1961
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,640
we can get deficiencies in both micro

1962
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:54,559
and macronutrients and micronutrients

1963
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,119
we're very prone to getting toxicities

1964
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:00,560
the plants do not need much at all for

1965
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:03,198
example boron plants need like a pound

1966
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,760
to the acre if you try and feed boron to

1967
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:07,599
your plants it's extremely easy to

1968
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,159
poison them accidentally by giving them

1969
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,239
too much where it goes toxic

1970
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:15,279
for that reason

1971
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:17,759
micronutrients we try to manage with ph

1972
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:21,759
we optimize ph to manage micronutrients

1973
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:23,760
if you can't correct that with ph

1974
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,760
then you would fully fully feed

1975
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,600
something like a chelate

1976
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,079
chelates are designed to be safe for

1977
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,159
plants they're very low application

1978
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:34,479
rates and they're also designed to move

1979
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,158
into the tissue and so that's a time

1980
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,000
when foliar feeding makes a lot of sense

1981
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:38,879
when foliar feeding does not make sense

1982
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,520
it's when you're trying to feed a

1983
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,679
macronutrient plants are designed to

1984
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,800
take up nutrients through the roots

1985
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,560
leaves are designed to keep things out

1986
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,039
when you fold your feet a macronutrient

1987
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:53,600
you often get a very quick rapid

1988
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:56,079
satisfying green up effect

1989
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,360
but that is temporary

1990
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:59,760
right that's why you have to follow your

1991
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,238
feed every week every couple of days

1992
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,000
that green up doesn't last and

1993
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:05,359
when we look at the tissue testing when

1994
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,119
we look at the research on it we find

1995
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:09,439
that foliar feeding is actually much

1996
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,679
more inefficient in terms of

1997
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:14,678
what the plant can take into itself and

1998
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,679
incorporate

1999
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,119
go ahead marion no it's gonna say you

2000
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,679
didn't get one question um if you want

2001
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,599
me to interrupt you um can you only feed

2002
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:25,760
through drip and not broadcast any

2003
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,039
fertilizer oh you can absolutely

2004
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,360
broadcast yeah you can absolutely

2005
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:30,880
broadcast um usually people who are

2006
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,880
broadcasting their open field tomatoes

2007
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,880
so they're not on plastic or they're

2008
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,279
broadcasting before they form up their

2009
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:40,000
beds right because

2010
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:42,639
the question was about not broadcasting

2011
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,800
and only foliar feeding right yes i

2012
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:49,440
think so only only foliar yes so

2013
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,600
can you only feed through drip and not

2014
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:54,879
broadcast any fertilizer that's the

2015
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,239
question ah yes yes you can

2016
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,480
and

2017
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,639
you can do that

2018
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,799
most growers will start off still

2019
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,039
broadcasting a little bit

2020
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,679
as they learn to manage the nutrition

2021
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,359
only through drip so if you've never

2022
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,800
done heavy management of nutrition

2023
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,599
through drip maybe broadcast some a

2024
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,600
little bit to start

2025
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,238
people who have been raising in tunnels

2026
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,399
or greenhouses for a long time they want

2027
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,559
both tunnels they won't broadcast that

2028
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:26,158
much at all if any

2029
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,239
and would that depend uh elizabeth on

2030
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,000
how whether you had sufficient

2031
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:31,678
nutrients like that soil test that you

2032
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
showed you you were sufficient for a lot

2033
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,000
of nutrients so it seemed as though that

2034
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,158
would be a good field to not you know

2035
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,359
possibly not broadcast in but but use

2036
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:41,279
the drip more

2037
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:42,960
absolutely and that actually was a test

2038
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:45,759
from a high tunnel that's in part why

2039
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,679
the ph was so high okay and so one of

2040
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,840
the things that this farm was doing was

2041
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:51,520
they had been adding a bunch of uh

2042
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,279
animal based compost year after year

2043
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,600
after year and all that dairy manure

2044
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:57,198
drove the ph way up and their fertility

2045
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,800
levels weigh up that's why they had so

2046
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,879
much excessive calcium and they had so

2047
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:04,000
much excessive phosphorus

2048
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,679
higher salt levels and they had really

2049
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,198
high ph as a result of all that

2050
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,880
composted dairy manure that went into

2051
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,319
that tunnel

2052
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,909
so in that case yeah they were just

2053
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:13,039
feeding through the drip um

2054
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:15,119
[Music]

2055
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,800
tomatoes are really

2056
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:18,238
really well understood in terms of

2057
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,880
fertility and their tissue testing

2058
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:22,959
tissue testing is a great tool i

2059
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,199
recommend that growers who are

2060
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,198
struggling with their fertility tissue

2061
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,960
tests at least twice a year so the first

2062
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,839
time you want a tissue test

2063
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,439
is about four weeks after transplanting

2064
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,239
and the second time you tissue test is

2065
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:38,559
when your first fruit are are tiny like

2066
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:41,359
not quite golf ball sized

2067
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,080
and so those two tissue tests give you

2068
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:45,599
two very important life stages the

2069
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,039
three to four weeks after transplanting

2070
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,600
is when that plant is about to enter its

2071
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:52,079
rapid vegetative growth phase and when

2072
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,079
the first fruit are not quite golf golf

2073
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,719
ball size that's when you're making that

2074
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,319
shift out of vegetative focus into

2075
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,000
reproductive focus

2076
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:01,840
when you tissue test you want to tissue

2077
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,079
test exactly this lab tells you

2078
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,920
oftentimes that's taking the first fully

2079
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,479
expanded mature leaf that tends to be

2080
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,158
about the fifth fleet down from any tip

2081
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:13,039
and you do count the little teeny tiny

2082
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:15,198
leaf um so fifth or sixth leaf down

2083
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,039
you want to do it when the plant is it

2084
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,960
you know it's got great water status so

2085
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,719
that leaf snaps right off and then you

2086
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,198
want to make sure that you

2087
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,719
rinse anything off of that leaf surface

2088
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:26,879
and then

2089
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,679
pat it dry before you put in the bag

2090
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,239
it's not hard to do it costs

2091
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:34,800
less than 20 including shipping

2092
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:37,359
and at those two times you still have

2093
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,440
the ability to correct any problems and

2094
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,920
the tissue testing shows you problems

2095
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:44,158
before you would see it in the plant so

2096
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,319
this is an example of a plant where you

2097
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,198
definitely would be seeing the issues

2098
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:48,799
you know

2099
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:52,319
big deficiencies in nitrogen big

2100
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,239
deficiencies in calcium or potassium

2101
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,000
manganese this is that same tunnel that

2102
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:58,479
had the very high ph so we're expecting

2103
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,198
a manganese deficiency driven by ph

2104
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:03,439
um excessive levels of calcium as we

2105
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:06,000
would expect from all of that uh the

2106
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:07,759
copper levels this happens when people

2107
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,880
forget to rinse off their leaves and so

2108
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,320
the copper they're spraying out the

2109
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,600
plants stays on the tissue test so you

2110
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,840
do have to do a little bit of

2111
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,199
interpretation here like oh yes i forgot

2112
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,960
that not that i have so much calcium i

2113
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:18,158
forgot or copper i forgot to rinse it

2114
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,600
off

2115
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,000
but the tissue test tells you things

2116
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,600
before you see it particularly for

2117
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,119
potassium

2118
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,880
and over the course of the season it

2119
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:28,960
becomes a very very good management tool

2120
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,760
so the way that we read this chart we

2121
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,600
have

2122
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,760
five different sampling dates across the

2123
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,760
bottom starting in the middle of may to

2124
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,000
middle of june or middle of july this is

2125
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,199
a high tunnel from a study that was done

2126
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,279
a couple years ago we have all the

2127
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,279
macronutrients across the bottom the

2128
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:44,880
green is the top of sufficiency range

2129
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:47,599
red is the bottom of the sufficiency

2130
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,400
range and you see that the range shifts

2131
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:53,199
the the first solid bars those are for

2132
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,399
the vegetative stage and all of these

2133
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:56,559
macronutrients

2134
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:58,559
the plant's physiological need for them

2135
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,679
is shifting as it moves into fruiting

2136
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,640
and veg and reproductive stage focus

2137
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,480
the blue are the levels of nutrition

2138
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,039
available in that plant and yes the

2139
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:11,039
tissue test is a look backwards in time

2140
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:13,119
but it is far better than waiting for

2141
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:14,800
the plant to color up by the time the

2142
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:16,158
plant colors up you've had so much

2143
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,000
damage that you've already lost the

2144
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:19,759
yield tissue testing helps you prevent

2145
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,158
some of that so we saw the nitrogen

2146
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,480
levels falling they dip too low growers

2147
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,799
changed their fertilizer blend

2148
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,000
potassium same thing that started

2149
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,880
dipping down they changed your

2150
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,600
fertilizer blend um

2151
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,719
so it's useful over the course of season

2152
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,880
and then

2153
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,560
just re-emphasizing that point if you

2154
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,480
don't rinse the leaves off you can see

2155
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,520
really big spikes in copper and that's

2156
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:43,198
that's just

2157
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,960
you spray copper and forgot to rinse it

2158
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,479
so foliar testing is a great tool for

2159
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,679
nutrient management

2160
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:49,198
i'm really quick and go through

2161
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,480
recognizing deficiencies i'm going to do

2162
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,719
this quick because there are so many

2163
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,198
good photos on the internet um this

2164
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,039
panel i have right here is kind of like

2165
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,479
it's old it's dated but it is the

2166
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,319
classic

2167
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:01,919
panel so it's very easy to recognize

2168
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:04,960
these bows they all have that kind of

2169
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,800
fridge magnet style look to it um so if

2170
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,319
you're on the internet you're like is

2171
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,480
this really that deficiency check it

2172
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,000
against these fridge magnet type images

2173
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,319
when you're searching

2174
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,840
so nitrogen is in mobile nutrient when

2175
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:17,279
it's deficient it's the lower leaves

2176
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,880
they're yellow the plant lacks bigger

2177
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,039
it's a weak plant very common for us to

2178
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,119
see more in tomatoes we see excessive

2179
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,920
nitrogen that's where you get this very

2180
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,880
dark bushy lush beautiful plant that

2181
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,800
doesn't flower that doesn't set fruit

2182
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,760
because you've got all this bushy plant

2183
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,000
because we tend to trellis our tomatoes

2184
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,760
all that material gets packed in it gets

2185
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,238
wounded wankers packed in you don't have

2186
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,480
good air flow and we see a much higher

2187
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:45,599
incidence of botrytis when we have

2188
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:46,879
excessive nitrogen so managing

2189
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,360
nitrogen

2190
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,800
is actually an ipm tactic for botrytis

2191
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,238
it also tends to reduce the

2192
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,639
attractiveness of your tomatoes to

2193
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:56,559
aphids ipm tactic

2194
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,719
um this is botrytis

2195
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,639
directly attacking foliage but it also

2196
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,158
leaves these ghost spots on the fruit

2197
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,319
and if you've ever had fruit where it

2198
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:05,119
starts this softer rot off the blossom

2199
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,639
end

2200
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:08,639
that's petritus getting in there but

2201
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:10,239
tries to hit the tomatoes at the

2202
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,159
flowering stage

2203
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:14,399
and then wait until it's man's mature to

2204
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:16,399
rot it when it goes directly after the

2205
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:18,879
foliage it's very hard to stop and we

2206
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:22,479
can lose tomato crops and tomato i've

2207
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,719
seen many tunnels go down to botrytis

2208
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,319
potassium is a mobile nutrient this is

2209
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,960
the one that you really want to watch

2210
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:31,759
it's very important physiologically for

2211
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,840
loading sugar into the plant okay if you

2212
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,760
can't have the sugar getting into the

2213
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,520
phloem to distribute around the plant

2214
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,520
then you're not going to be growing very

2215
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,080
well that means you're looking for

2216
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,000
scrawny tips to the shoots you're

2217
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:45,519
looking for flower abortion like we see

2218
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,119
in this photo here

2219
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,199
you're starting to see yellow shoulders

2220
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,679
develop on the fruit that are maturing

2221
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:54,000
in really severe cases you'll get a

2222
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,000
purpling across the leaf surface the

2223
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,520
whole plant is suffering and you can

2224
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,119
start to see other secondary nutrition

2225
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,960
symptoms show up

2226
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:04,319
potassium is the one

2227
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,000
that you're watching with the tissue

2228
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:09,119
test more than anything else because

2229
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,639
it's more of an invisible deficiency by

2230
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,920
the time you start seeing the signs of

2231
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:16,159
it you've already lost yield potential

2232
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,760
and you've definitely lost quality

2233
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:19,359
really poor flavor

2234
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,199
yellow shoulders that's usually

2235
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,880
potassium a little bit of a magnesium

2236
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:24,479
thing so if your flavor is not where you

2237
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,079
want to be

2238
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:29,279
try adjusting your potassium magnesium

2239
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:32,000
phosphorus

2240
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:33,359
um phosphorus is very common it's not

2241
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,920
that available in cold soils you

2242
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:37,439
remember earlier i said that

2243
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,199
most labs will recommend a little bit of

2244
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:40,399
phosphorus even if the levels are just

2245
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:42,079
out of this

2246
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:43,198
this world sky eye

2247
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,439
it's because

2248
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,039
cold soils phosphorus isn't it but the

2249
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,559
plants can't get it part of that is

2250
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,920
because there's a fungal intermediary

2251
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,320
that helps to collect a lot of the

2252
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,000
phosphorus the soils are cold the fungus

2253
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:54,960
is not all that active

2254
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,880
um

2255
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,158
it means that it's very common and it's

2256
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,359
a temporary thing that we see in

2257
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:02,799
transplants it's a reddening or purpling

2258
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:04,799
on the underside of the leaves you flip

2259
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,520
that leaf over and all the veins

2260
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:10,719
are coloring up

2261
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,840
we can most easily resolve this by using

2262
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,158
a little bit phosphorous in the

2263
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,440
transplant water or by using a raised

2264
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:19,039
bed plastic mulch to get it warm now

2265
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:20,879
phosphorus is really important for root

2266
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,800
growth so that's why they're

2267
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,239
recommending is yes the soils are cold

2268
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,679
but we also need to really quickly

2269
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,319
establish fruits

2270
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,239
so feed the phosphorus early as we go

2271
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:32,000
through the summer their need goes way

2272
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:34,399
down and particularly in tunnels where

2273
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,920
phosphorus tends to build way up or in

2274
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:38,399
organic farms we're using a lot of

2275
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,840
animal based inputs phosphorus levels

2276
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,599
get quite high

2277
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,360
um you can pull the phosphorus

2278
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,679
completely out of your summer drip

2279
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:47,839
program the soil will supply it

2280
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,158
if you have a soil that is very low in

2281
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,960
ph or you have soils are naturally very

2282
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:54,879
high in aluminum a lot of shenangos are

2283
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,279
very nice agricultural soils but they're

2284
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,760
naturally very high in aluminum

2285
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:01,920
know that phosphorus is inhibited by

2286
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,760
excessive levels of aluminum in the soil

2287
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,600
in those cases when you have very high

2288
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,880
aluminum you do want to feed phosphorus

2289
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,719
through the summer

2290
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,920
and phosphorus is loaded into the leaves

2291
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,520
first so

2292
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,158
you may see

2293
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:17,840
that color hang on the old leaves you're

2294
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:17,839
checking the new growth for improvement

2295
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,080
magnesium

2296
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:24,079
another macronutrient

2297
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:25,359
very very common to see some deficiency

2298
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,679
in magnesium

2299
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,439
it's a mobile nutrient so the plants

2300
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,399
will reallocate from low in the plant up

2301
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,638
to high in the plant when they're a

2302
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,399
little bit deficient it's intervenal

2303
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,960
yellowing so it's spotting between the

2304
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,319
leaves with age you can see here they

2305
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,079
start to get a little bit of a bronze

2306
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:42,319
spot in the center of that

2307
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:44,079
um purple or bronzing in the center of

2308
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,238
the yellow in between the veins that's

2309
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,519
magnesium this isn't something to get

2310
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:49,919
excited about as long as it's in the

2311
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,000
bottom part of the canopy it's natural

2312
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,520
uh you're really wanting that to stay

2313
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,800
stay good in the middle so with

2314
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,960
magnesium we divide the plant in thirds

2315
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,719
if it's in the lower third of a mature

2316
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,239
sized plant not a big deal if it starts

2317
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,840
creeping up or getting more severe and

2318
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,238
heading towards the middle third you

2319
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,079
want to be managing that

2320
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,519
um elizabeth we're getting

2321
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:13,439
tight on time just to let you know about

2322
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:15,360
two minutes left okay thanks so

2323
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:18,399
just a side by side this is a tunnel

2324
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:20,639
that had a lot of fertility problems

2325
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:23,279
not caused by lack of available

2326
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:26,319
nutrition in the soil but caused by

2327
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,319
problems like severe compaction too much

2328
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:31,359
salts they had other factors inhibiting

2329
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:34,079
their fertility uptake so we've got a

2330
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:36,158
severe potassium deficiency once it gets

2331
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,158
this bad that's coloring up the foliage

2332
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:40,559
we tend to see it make other nutrient

2333
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,799
problems even worse calcium deficiency

2334
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,199
will color up the edges of leaf and it's

2335
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,920
a fairly bright coloring up of the edge

2336
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,919
calcium deficiency does not

2337
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,000
um calcium doesn't move through the

2338
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,760
plant so you'll see a color one age

2339
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,439
group of leaves

2340
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,679
the next age group of leaves won't have

2341
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:59,678
it but that age group will never get

2342
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,880
better you'll have that for life in that

2343
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,239
age group what you're looking is for

2344
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,319
improvement

2345
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,718
this is magnesium as it gets more severe

2346
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:08,079
and this blossom end rot a lot of people

2347
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,239
say it's calcium but it's not it's

2348
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:13,039
actually water you didn't have enough

2349
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:15,439
water to move the calcium to the fruit

2350
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:16,719
so calcium level is fine inconsistent

2351
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,559
watering

2352
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,000
these are the most common nutrient

2353
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,280
deficiencies

2354
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,600
they do

2355
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:26,158
lead to weak plants they do cause other

2356
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,120
ipm problems as you go down the road

2357
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:28,559
and

2358
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:30,238
once you get these gross overall

2359
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,239
nutrient deficiencies just one final

2360
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,479
photo you can see all the disease in

2361
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:37,439
here all the decay all the rot

2362
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,718
and also some really cute birds so on

2363
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,759
that

2364
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:43,279
we're gonna

2365
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:45,600
end the presentation i'll stop sharing

2366
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:47,599
and if you have any questions please

2367
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,679
drop them in the chat

2368
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:52,320
so there is one that just came into the

2369
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:55,039
chat um do much soils have an effect on

2370
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:55,920
tomato fertility okay yeah great

2371
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:59,359
question

2372
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:02,158
so muck soil is incredibly high organic

2373
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,079
matter soil it's the formed from like

2374
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:05,599
dead plants and trees and stuff really

2375
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,359
old swamp

2376
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,600
um

2377
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:11,039
because of that it holds so much more

2378
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,039
nutrition

2379
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,840
per unit of soil so if you have like a

2380
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:18,238
cup of soil it holds much more nutrition

2381
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,039
because it holds so much more nutrition

2382
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:21,119
uh

2383
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,800
the actual ph because it holds so much

2384
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,960
more nutrition because the soil

2385
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,960
naturally sits at a lower ph

2386
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,840
all of our

2387
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:33,359
values if we say tomatoes like ph 5

2388
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:35,600
there's 6.5 to six eight you adjust that

2389
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,279
downwards almost one whole unit when

2390
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,639
you're working on muck

2391
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:40,800
and that's because the nature of the

2392
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,239
soils a they run more acidic b they can

2393
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,639
make up for it by holding so much more

2394
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:46,479
fertility so if you are testing a muck

2395
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,079
it's going to

2396
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:49,359
you know show low

2397
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:51,679
that's okay

2398
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:53,679
don't be freaked out by that you do have

2399
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,199
to watch some of your micronutrients a

2400
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,359
little more closely because some mucks

2401
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,638
don't have a lot of that uh depending on

2402
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,799
where you are in the state if you may

2403
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,480
have a mug that's underlaid by a lot of

2404
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,400
calcium and that will change your

2405
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:05,919
fertility management if it doesn't have

2406
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:07,439
the calcium underlay you tend to be very

2407
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,920
high in sulfur you need to supplement

2408
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:10,919
calcium there

2409
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:24,359
this has been a production of cornell
