1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,439
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,439
University.

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,678
So, it is my pleasure to introduce

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,880
Hannah Zonavville, who is a secondyear

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
PhD student here in soil and crop

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,800
sciences. Hannah got her bachelor's

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,839
degree from the University of Michigan

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,880
uh where she worked on topics uh

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:30,559
including moose herbivy and northern

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,519
forests. Hannah then went on to uh live

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,960
and work in Chicago for two years um

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,200
where she worked for an environmental um

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,799
education nonprofit and also was a uh

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,160
community science fellow with the

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,078
American geoysical

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,238
union here in SIPS. Hannah has served as

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
the graduate student council chair, the

18
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,198
soil and crop sciences graduate student

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,320
assembly vice president and as a

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:01,759
representative on the DDI council. She

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,640
also regularly leads outreach activities

22
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,679
and finds way to create broad and

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,519
inclusive science focused communities.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Today Hannah will be telling us about

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,039
her dissertation research which is

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,719
supported by an NSF graduate student

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,880
fellowship. Please join me in welcoming

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,879
Hannah.

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,959
Thanks for that kind introduction, Dan.

30
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,438
And hello everyone. If I haven't met you

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,919
yet, my name is Hannah and I'm a PhD

32
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,359
student with Dan. And today I'm super

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
excited to share with you all the work

34
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,118
that I've been doing since coming to

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
Cornell, which is leveraging remote

36
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,959
sensing to quantify pollen production

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,879
across space and time for Junifer's

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,759
Ashi.

39
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,920
Before I jump into the nitty-gritty of

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,000
my project, I wanted to first give you a

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
little bit of background about me. As

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
Dan mentioned, I hail from the great

43
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,839
state of Michigan where I attended the

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,079
University of Michigan and fell in love

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,880
with plant ecology through a series of

46
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,718
undergraduate experiences there. After

47
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,359
graduating, I wanted to do some more

48
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,679
community focused work. And so I did an

49
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,599
Americanore service year in Chicago with

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
an environmental education nonprofit

51
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,719
that partners with Chicago public

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,598
schools to bring a comprehensive freeof

53
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,080
charge outdoor STEM education to

54
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,318
students from low-income households. And

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,280
it was during this experience that I saw

56
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,919
firsthand how the systemic racism in US

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
leads to really awful inequities in

58
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,799
terms of educational opportunities,

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,519
access to nature, and ultimately public

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,439
health outcomes. And so when I was

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
thinking about returning to graduate

62
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,318
school, I wanted to find a way to unite

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,159
these two passions and ultimately do

64
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,079
work that could help alleviate some of

65
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,120
the public health burdens that I was

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,080
witnessing. And that is what brought me

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,200
to the cat's lab here at Cornell. And we

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
focus on plant related public health

69
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,318
problems. And the one that I focus on

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,120
specifically is that of airborne

71
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:03,839
pollen. So who among us has pollen

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
allergies? Raise your hand. Oh yeah.

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,239
Okay. Well, don't worry. Misery loves

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
company and you are not alone. It is

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,759
actually estimated that over 80 million

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,319
people in the United States have

77
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,560
seasonal allergies. And the worst that

78
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,359
most of you will suffer are, you know, a

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
runny nose, maybe trouble sleeping for a

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
few weeks out of the year. But for

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,599
people with chronic respiratory issues,

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,319
these asthma allergies and subsequent

83
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,479
pollen exposures can be dangerous and

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,439
result in emergency department visits

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,199
due to asthma exacerbations. And we also

86
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,280
know that asthma is not equally

87
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,039
distributed across the United States.

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
There's plenty of research that shows

89
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,318
that asthma is um in a higher

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,080
concentrations within communities that

91
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:50,479
are lower income. And so I have

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
additional bad news and that is that

93
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,479
pollen exposure is increasing with

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
climate change. We're seeing that the

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,079
increased temperatures are leading to a

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
longer growing season. What you're

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,040
seeing here is the consecutive days

98
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,199
above freezing which allows plants to

99
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,120
start releasing pollen early in earlier

100
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,158
in the year and then continue later into

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,400
the year. It's also resulting in range

102
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,239
expansion for different allergenic

103
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,040
species. This is something we're seeing

104
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,280
in common ragweed in Europe. And a

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,079
recent meta analysis done in the cat's

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,159
lab showed that plants are al able to

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,040
allocate more carbon to reproductive

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,199
structures under increased um carbon

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
conditions. And so there's a variety of

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
mechanisms that climate change is

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,199
increasing pollen exposure and therefore

112
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,478
possibly impacting downstream public

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,560
health effects. Um lucky for us, as with

114
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,039
most things, uh science has the

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
potential to offer a solution. And this

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,360
solution can look like better airborne

117
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,279
pollen

118
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,800
forecasts. Um, airborne fall pollen for

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,279
forecasts can help people know when they

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,600
might be exposed to pollen such that

121
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,918
they can take their allergy medications

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,479
with enough time prior to exposure so

123
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,198
that it reaches its full efficacy by

124
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,719
time that they are exposed to pollen. It

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
can also let people know when to turn on

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,400
their air filters or help them avoid

127
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,758
pollen hot spots.

128
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,679
However, current predictions of airborne

129
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
pollen are insufficient to help people

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,160
avoid this exposure. What you're seeing

131
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,679
here is some work done by Dan that shows

132
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,639
the predicted airborne pollen

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,759
um concentration from commercial

134
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,280
forecasters compared to the empirically

135
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,720
measured pollen concentration from

136
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,038
pollen monitoring stations. And so

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,680
pollen.com is doing all right, but the

138
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,478
rest of them leave a little bit of room

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,478
for improvement. And if you are

140
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,120
associated with any of these companies,

141
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:51,279
I'm not smack talking. I'm just inviting

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,000
you to fund me. Um, so with that, you

143
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:57,439
might be asking, well, why is it that

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,160
current airborne pollen is is modeled so

145
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,839
poorly? And one of the key reasons for

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,000
this is because we just don't really

147
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,000
know how much pollen is being produced

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,038
across space and time. The current

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
method for measuring airborne pollen is

150
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,918
through a sparsely populated network of

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
airborne pollen monitoring stations.

152
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,079
There are only about 50 in the

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,478
contiguous US. And so it does a really

154
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,318
bad job of capturing the spatiotemporal

155
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:27,120
variation in pollen production. Um, and

156
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,840
it is really difficult to calculate the

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,759
amount of pollen being produced based on

158
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:34,159
ecology of plants because it's super

159
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,360
hard to study how plant reproduction

160
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,759
varies over large spatial extents. Um,

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,919
as you can see, the historical way of

162
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
doing this is is manual measurements

163
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,918
that take a very long time and actually

164
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,079
can limit studies that involve counting

165
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,719
these reproductive structures on plants

166
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,279
to sample sizes of only 10 to hundreds

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,520
of individuals. And further, it only

168
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,359
covers a small portion of the tree and a

169
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,758
small portion of the range of these

170
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,879
plants.

171
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,199
Um, lucky for us, we live in the time of

172
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,598
remote sensing, which is an amazing tool

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,680
in our toolbox that we can use to study

174
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,360
ecological processes across the entire

175
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,680
ecosystem. And there's been plenty of

176
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,639
literature in the past couple years that

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,199
uses aerial images to track the timing

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,519
of plant reproduction. And so it has

179
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,720
been posited that we could perhaps use

180
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,079
aerial images such as with drones or

181
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,840
with satellite images to quantify the

182
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,240
number of reproductive structures on

183
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,399
plants such that we could calculate

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,319
pollen production that we could use to

185
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:44,318
inform these better airborne pollen

186
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,360
models. So as you can probably guess my

187
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,840
research focuses on one central theme

188
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,160
which is building better airborne pollen

189
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,159
models. I have just proved to you all

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,039
that this could definitely help public

191
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,840
health outcomes and improve the way that

192
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,519
people interact with plants. Um, but in

193
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,038
order to do this, we need to have a

194
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,799
better understanding of pollen

195
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,759
production across space and time. And to

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,038
help do this, I have designed three

197
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,000
chapters to pursue here at Cornell. The

198
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,159
first one is to actually measure the

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,120
amount of pollen production over space

200
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,160
space and time using remote sensing. The

201
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,319
next is to build off of the data

202
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,039
collected in chapter 1 to then start to

203
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
disentangle the biot abiotic drivers of

204
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,000
plant reproduction. This is possible

205
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,759
because the chapter 1 data set will let

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,679
us quantify the number of reproductive

207
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,080
structures on plants that we can pair

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,879
with grided environmental data and start

209
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,240
to model what might be the dominant

210
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,360
drivers of plant reproduction. And in my

211
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,560
third chapter, I hope to take a

212
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,720
ecological forecasting approach and

213
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,559
actually try to predict how climate

214
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
change might affect future pollen

215
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,759
production of these plants. Uh this is a

216
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,319
similar approach that has been done in

217
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,120
phenology but has not yet been done for

218
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
pollen production. Um I'm going to spend

219
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,240
most of my time today talking about

220
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,839
chapter 1 since that is what I have

221
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,680
worked the most on so far. Um but I will

222
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,360
also give you a little teaser into

223
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:26,399
chapter 2 towards the end. Um with that

224
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,560
let's get into it. So, I'd now like to

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,080
introduce you to my study species, the

226
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:34,719
beautiful ash juniper or juniperous

227
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,879
ashi. Uh, juniperous ashi is an

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,759
evergreen dishious plant that is the

229
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,679
dominant tree species along in central

230
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,720
Texas where it thrives on the

231
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:48,479
calccarious soil of the Edwards Plateau.

232
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,519
And uh it is known by locals as an

233
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,360
infamous infamous producer of pollen

234
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,639
that causes something known as cedar

235
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,440
fever. And cedar fever is an awful

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,480
affliction that results in severe runny

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
noses, achy joints, trouble sleeping,

238
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,278
and it can actually even cause some

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,120
people to run a fever. And the culprit

240
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:13,200
of cedar fever is the super abundant

241
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,679
number of reproductive structures on

242
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
these plants, which are pollen cones.

243
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,838
Um, male individuals can actually

244
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,159
contain up to 1.3 million pollen cones

245
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
on a single tree. And each of these

246
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:31,000
cones can have almost half a million

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,399
grains of pollen. And so this pollen is

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,559
so abundant and so allergenic that past

249
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,200
work in the system has revealed that it

250
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,958
can contribute up to 18% of asthma

251
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
related emergency department visits

252
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,879
during peak pollen season. So yeah, you

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,519
can see the pollen coming off of these

254
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,399
trees in waves and it is um from

255
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,000
personal experience very unpleasant. So,

256
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,559
um, the thing that makes ash juniper a

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
horrible neighbor to all of the Texans

258
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,799
actually makes it a wonderful study

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,120
species for me because the pollen cones

260
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,519
have very distinct visual properties. As

261
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
you can probably tell, this individual,

262
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
which is a male with pollen cones, looks

263
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
quite different from this individual,

264
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
which is a female having no pollen

265
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,000
cones. So, let's take a little bit of a

266
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,720
closer look at these cones.

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,278
They have this kind of beautiful orange

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,079
color that makes them stand out against

269
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,720
the the green foliage that you can see

270
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,838
here. And so it is this aspect of the

271
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,399
ash juniper that makes it observable

272
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,279
from aerial imagery.

273
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,000
In this case, I have been trying to

274
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,799
derive methods that use aerial images

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,440
from drones as well as manual methods to

276
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,958
quantify the number of cones on these

277
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,200
trees using their spectral

278
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,399
properties. And I'd now like to show you

279
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,640
a little bit more about what those

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,278
methods look

281
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,439
like. So to test my methodology, I have

282
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,838
established 14 study sites across the

283
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
range of the ash juniper trees in

284
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
central Texas. You can see that the

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,278
study sites cover a range of

286
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
environmental conditions including

287
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,000
temperature, precipitation and what is

288
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:14,799
displayed here is soil moisture data

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,879
from SMAP. And uh at each site I choose

290
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,838
between five to 10 focal trees on which

291
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,039
I take a comprehensive suite of

292
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,880
measurements. And I take additional

293
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,078
phenology measurements from surrounding

294
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,320
trees to try to understand how the

295
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,239
timing of reproduction varies among

296
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,040
these trees and how that might impact

297
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,600
the spectral reading from the images. I

298
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,919
have done this for two field seasons now

299
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,240
which I go to Texas in January. So it's

300
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,479
a nice little escape from Ithaca winter

301
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,000
but um Unfortunately, that seems to last

302
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,000
until mid April. Anyway, so um I was

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,360
also very lucky this past field season

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,240
to be joined by a wonderful UT grad, Dr.

305
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,480
Analisa Shield Estrada, who was not only

306
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,639
a really hard worker, but an absolute

307
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,278
joy to be around. So, I'm really

308
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,839
grateful for her help on this project.

309
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:07,278
And so to show you a little bit more

310
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,920
about the methods in practice, um I

311
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,600
first select my focal trees at each

312
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,519
study site and take a couple of manual

313
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,399
measurements. This year this included

314
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,720
the diameter at breast height and the

315
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,000
height. I then put a quadrat with a

316
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,000
known area in on a branch of the tree so

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,440
that it's facing upward and visible by

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,200
the drone. And after I fly the drone, I

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,519
harvest all of the foliage that falls

320
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,079
within that known area of the quadrat.

321
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,919
Then I use a super sophisticated method

322
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,278
for homogenizing it where I run it

323
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,759
through a mulure and that enables me to

324
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:45,039
have a repres representative sample

325
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,679
where I can subsample the foliage 10

326
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,480
times, take its weight and count. And

327
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,879
this will give me the number of grams of

328
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,519
foli number of cones per grams of

329
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,679
foliage that I can then multiply to the

330
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,560
number of cones per grams of foliage for

331
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,519
the entire tree by using alometric

332
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,119
equations based on diameter press height

333
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,679
and height to give me the total gram of

334
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,278
foliage for the tree. And so these are

335
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,278
all my manual methods. But we're not

336
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,078
done yet because we now get to do some

337
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,879
fun remote sensing things. So from the

338
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,278
drone images, I find the quadrats, crop

339
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,559
that down so that it only contains pixel

340
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:25,278
values that fall within that known area.

341
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,479
I then extract all of the pixel values

342
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,720
from that image and correlate these

343
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,240
pixel values, their red, green, and blue

344
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,560
values to the known quantity of cones

345
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,839
that I just estimated using my manual

346
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,599
methods. This results in an index that

347
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,560
can be used to predict the number of

348
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,278
cones per grams based solely on the red,

349
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,239
green, and blue values. So having this

350
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,838
index allows us to extend our

351
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,879
measurements of these reproductive

352
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,959
structures beyond just the focal trees.

353
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,399
And I'd now like to show you the

354
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,319
index. So this is what I am

355
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
provisionally calling the oreness index.

356
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,360
If you have any other um

357
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,120
recommendations, let me know. Um, but it

358
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,360
is a combination of the red and green

359
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,759
values. Red minus green over red plus

360
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,480
green. And as you can see here, I on the

361
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,720
y-axis we have cone density. And so this

362
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,519
is the manually estimated cones that I

363
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,160
used with my subsampling. And higher

364
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,399
cone density results in a higher index

365
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,719
value because there are more cones in

366
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,799
the picture, more red values, more

367
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,720
positive value. compared to this quadra

368
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,198
over here that has very few cones and a

369
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
very low cone density has a lot more

370
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,559
green values associated and therefore

371
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,519
returns a lower index value.

372
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,958
So awesome. We have our index. What does

373
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,919
it look like when you actually apply it

374
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,039
to images? What you're seeing here is a

375
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,679
quadrat picture that I have processed to

376
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,000
only retain the pixel values that are

377
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,559
either foliage or cone. I use a random

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,198
forest pixel classifier. You can see the

379
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,559
results down here, but it performs very

380
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:11,838
well. And so when you apply the index to

381
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,319
this, you can see that the positive

382
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,240
values do indeed match up with where the

383
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,800
cones are. Uh for visualization

384
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,879
purposes, I just created a binary. So

385
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,198
the positive values associated with

386
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,919
cones are orange and the green values

387
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:30,078
associated with foliage are negative and

388
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:32,000
green. Um and so yeah, you can see that

389
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,679
it it works pretty well and does a good

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
job of picking up the distinct

391
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,078
properties of these cones.

392
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,759
But remember that the overall goal is to

393
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:43,039
use this index to count cones from trees

394
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,560
that we don't actually have the manual

395
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:50,078
measurements on. So let's try to do

396
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:52,078
that. Here you are seeing a uh subset of

397
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,679
an orthomosaic image from the drone

398
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,879
which is basically just a stitched

399
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,399
together landscape level picture that I

400
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,799
put together all of the pictures from a

401
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,600
drone at a study site. And you can see

402
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,198
the the varying densities of of cones on

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,519
these trees. So there's some with a lot

404
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,600
higher density compared to some here

405
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,838
with lower

406
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,000
density. And what I've done is manually

407
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,759
segmented these tree tops so that we can

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,480
only retain pixel values that fall

409
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,798
within the canopy. And once again I can

410
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,959
extract the pixel values here and apply

411
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,160
run it through the pixel classifier.

412
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,640
Apply the index and here we are. So

413
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,759
again, the lower values are associated

414
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,759
with more foliage and the higher values

415
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,319
are associated with a higher cone

416
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,879
density. From here, we have all of the

417
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,038
ingredients that we need to actually go

418
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,559
ahead and quantify the number of

419
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,359
reproductive structures and therefore

420
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,918
the pollen production of these trees

421
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,240
because we can again calculate the total

422
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,160
grams of foliage for these trees using

423
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,319
alometric equations where the gram of

424
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
foliage is a function of the diameter,

425
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,038
breast height, and height. And then we

426
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,520
can take the average pixel value or the

427
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,519
average index value from these trees,

428
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,599
multiply it by the grams of foliage from

429
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,480
the alometric equations, and this can

430
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,480
give us the number of cones per tree.

431
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,038
Using this, we can calculate the pollen

432
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,038
produced, and this can all go back into

433
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,599
creating better airborne pollen

434
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,359
forecasts based on a more comprehensive

435
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,879
measure of the amount of pollen being

436
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,038
produced.

437
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,640
So, well, I am definitely very excited

438
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:29,119
about these methods and my um my work so

439
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,240
far. There's plenty of limitations and

440
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,319
it's not um perfect. Some limitations

441
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,519
that have been difficult to work through

442
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,240
are that the trees have kind of a wide

443
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,000
variety of coloring in their foliage.

444
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,919
So, as you can see here, this is a tree

445
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,240
that has a lot more yellow foliage

446
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,720
rather than green. And so it's returning

447
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,120
a really high index value despite there

448
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,120
not being very many cones in it.

449
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,719
Further, the index is sensitive to

450
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,079
lighting conditions. So when we have

451
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,720
pictures that are either very

452
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:04,558
overexposed or very shadowy, they um the

453
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,519
index is is not able to do a very good

454
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,678
job of calculating the number or

455
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,240
predicting the number of cones based

456
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,000
just on the spectral properties. Um,

457
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,160
additionally, it has been difficult to

458
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
calibrate the index using coarser

459
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,679
resolution images from the drone and so

460
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm still working out some kinks there.

461
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,400
Um, but when I'm thinking about next

462
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,919
steps, there's a lot that I am looking

463
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,400
forward to working on. So, first, um, I

464
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,640
plan to create alometric equations that

465
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,200
are specifically using remote sensing

466
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,400
variables. Um, this is what these trees

467
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,240
look like. So it is really not that fun

468
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,480
to take the diameter at breast height of

469
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,759
these trees and also probably not that

470
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,798
useful um because it is not a variable

471
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:54,798
that's observable from aerial

472
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:57,359
images. Um so I plan to use lidar in the

473
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,918
coming field season to create better

474
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,959
alometric equations that rely on

475
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,880
variables such as height and canopy

476
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,360
diameter instead of diameter breast

477
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
height. that will save me a lot of time

478
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,159
and a lot of being stabbed in the eye.

479
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,240
So, I'm looking forward to that. And

480
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:19,600
next, um these trees, as I think with

481
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,079
all other trees, are 3D objects. So,

482
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,839
they um contain a lot of information on

483
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,798
the sides of the trees that are missed

484
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,879
from aerial images. So to account for

485
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,759
the number of cones that are hidden from

486
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,320
aerial images, I've taken some orbital

487
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:37,519
flights around my focal trees and I plan

488
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,200
to create a conversion factor for the

489
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,158
number of cones that are missed when

490
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,240
just looking at the trees from the top

491
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,400
down. Um, next, and this is kind of like

492
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,839
my my big push right now is to figure

493
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,679
out ways to adjust for different

494
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,158
lighting conditions. Again, you're

495
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,960
seeing here a quadrat picture that is

496
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799
just a in a lot of shadows and the index

497
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
doesn't really know what's going on with

498
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:03,279
the number of cones that it is seeing

499
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,880
here. So, if you have um any kind of

500
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,639
workflow that you've used in your

501
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,240
research, I'd be very happy to hear

502
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,840
about it. Um and hopefully I can find a

503
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,798
workaround for this. And lastly, one

504
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:20,399
next step that is feeling especially

505
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:24,158
exciting to me is scaling up to uh

506
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,038
satellite images using the the index to

507
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,280
be able to measure cone production and

508
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:33,919
pollen production across much larger

509
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:36,319
spatial and temporal extents. Um, and

510
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
this would allow us to get a more

511
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,639
comprehensive data set across central

512
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,319
Texas at the regional level rather than

513
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,880
just being limited to the study sites

514
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:50,558
that I'm able to visit. Um, so I want to

515
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,640
now bring us back to where we started.

516
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:57,200
So I have shown you so far how we can

517
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,280
better measure pollen production across

518
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,519
large spatial and temporal extents. Um,

519
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,399
and so now that we can measure it, how

520
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,119
can we use this information and pair it

521
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,080
with existing environmental data to

522
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:17,038
start to understand what the abiotic

523
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:19,759
drivers of reproduction might be um that

524
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,839
yeah drive variation reproduction across

525
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:26,558
space and

526
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:28,720
time. So this is um this is very uh new

527
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,720
data that is more of a proof of concept

528
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,759
than anything. But what you're seeing

529
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,558
here is the mean index value from my

530
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:41,038
sites compared with the mean soil

531
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:43,279
moisture data from SMAP. And it is this

532
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,079
kind of workflow that I hope to use in

533
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,839
my second chapter to compare the

534
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,839
reproductive output with grided

535
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,000
environmental data sets. Obviously,

536
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,720
reproduction is an incredibly complex

537
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,440
process that will require um much more

538
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,600
sophisticated statistical tools such as

539
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,159
um hierarchical modeling to start to

540
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,918
uncover what is driving the variability

541
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:09,600
in reproduction in these trees. But um

542
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:14,400
yeah, I'm I'm excited to explore this in

543
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:17,038
my uh coming years at Cornell. Um so key

544
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,038
takeaways um if you remember nothing

545
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,480
else from this presentation my name is

546
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,839
Hannah and also um I have just shown you

547
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
that we can measure pollen production

548
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,918
over these large spatial extents using

549
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,079
aerial images which will allow us to

550
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
create better airborne pollen forecasts.

551
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,240
That is part of my chapter 1. Um and

552
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
then we can also use the data set

553
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,120
collected here to start to explore the

554
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
abiotic drivers of the variability in

555
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,158
reproduction for these trees. And this

556
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,639
will be part of my chapter two and you

557
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,679
will just have to stay tuned for chapter

558
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,600
three. Um with that I'd like to thank

559
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
everyone who made this work possible.

560
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,879
Everything we're doing is in the

561
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,119
presence of others and I'm I'm so

562
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,000
grateful for everyone. Um not only the

563
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,599
people listed on this slide but um just

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,798
to be in community with you all has been

565
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:07,359
a real joy at Cornell. So thank you and

566
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,599
I'll I I'll take questions now or later.

567
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,439
Okay.

568
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,079
I'm just curious how did you arrive at

569
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,519
your sort of oreness index and did you

570
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,599
try other sort of indicy? Oh yeah, great

571
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,879
question. Yeah, I tried a lot of indices

572
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,399
actually. It was a lot of like looking

573
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,640
through the literature and seeing what

574
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,600
other people have used. Um, and we

575
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,480
arrived at the oreness index just kind

576
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,639
of by way of it being what seemed the

577
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,519
most feasible. like because the cones

578
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,038
are so orange, it's um we thought that

579
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:41,839
maybe because there would be more red

580
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,278
values um associated with those cones

581
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,278
compared to the green values that would

582
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,679
be like the best combination of bands to

583
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:51,599
actually pick up on those differences,

584
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,038
but um yeah, definitely was still could

585
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,918
possibly change, but that's what's

586
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,919
worked the best so far.

587
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,080
I was wondering is there hope to uh I

588
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,240
mean maybe the answer will come when you

589
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,879
have more information on chapter 2 but

590
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,798
is there hope to kind of do a survey

591
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,400
um one year and then run with that

592
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,519
information for several years or you

593
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,000
think that it's going to be something

594
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,558
that has to be done like yearly? That's

595
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,960
a good that's a good question. So like

596
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,240
how often for data collection? I plan to

597
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,079
do three years. Um, but the idea is that

598
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,558
if we could scale up to satellite

599
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,879
images, this would enable me to not

600
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,839
actually go down and collect the the

601
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,480
data, but have a longer time series

602
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,399
both, you know, back into before I

603
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,720
started at Cornell and then when I don't

604
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,360
have to go down anymore and kind of like

605
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,960
using that um, information as well. But

606
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,119
yeah, awesome. Okay, thank you all so

607
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,679
much.

608
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,479
So um thanks again Hannah for a

609
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,559
wonderful talk and I'd like to introduce

610
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,038
Dr. Dave Miller next. Um Dave is a

611
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,558
posttock working with me here in soil

612
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:07,359
and crop sciences. Um and he did his

613
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:11,519
undergrad at Boston University and then

614
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:15,038
he got a master's and PhD from uh UC

615
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:19,679
Santa Barbara. Um he then went on to do

616
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:22,158
a posttock at UC Berkeley. Uh and some

617
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,240
of the the topics of the work uh for his

618
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,278
uh dissertation and for his first

619
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,200
posttock uh were about uh trees and

620
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,960
cities and using remote sensing to

621
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,519
understand the effects of drought on

622
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,600
them. uh his work from these

623
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,000
uh was published in journals including

624
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,759
nature communications and remote sensing

625
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,038
of environment

626
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,480
um and we've been very fortunate to lure

627
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:53,400
Dave away from sunny California um and

628
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,159
he has been instrumental in uh this uh

629
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,559
transdisciplinary uh collaboration the

630
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,278
cool trees team which is working to

631
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,278
understand how we can use trees to keep

632
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,558
cities cool during heat waves and

633
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:08,319
ultimately reduce heat related

634
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:11,038
morbidity. Um, and we've been very

635
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,599
fortunate to have uh Dave here and to

636
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:17,599
benefit from his expertise in remote

637
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,319
sensing and in making beautiful maps.

638
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,079
So, um, please join me in welcoming

639
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,599
Dave.

640
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,678
Um, thank you Dan for that kind

641
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,839
introduction and um, welcome everyone to

642
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,159
our second of two talks today. Um, it's

643
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,359
a tough hack to follow and I'll do my

644
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,640
best. Um so today I'm going to be

645
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,798
talking a lot about New York City and

646
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,400
classifying urban tree species using a

647
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,319
lot of high resolution satellite time

648
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,480
series for heat related public health

649
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,200
impacts. Um a lot of our co-authors here

650
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,079
are at Cornell in civil engineering and

651
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,400
also in Wild Cornell um in New York. Um

652
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,558
and we'll kind of get into it. So tree

653
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
species vary in cooling capacity, but

654
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,079
how can we use this to actually reduce

655
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,360
heat? anyone who's walked under

656
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,199
different types of trees in your

657
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,558
neighborhood, a big maple tree is going

658
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,159
to provide a lot more shade, a lot more

659
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,558
cooling than perhaps a smaller cherry

660
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,159
tree would. And so tree species actually

661
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,918
cool differently in the environment, but

662
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,880
these differences aren't really included

663
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,440
in models of for heat and human exposure

664
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,000
health related. Um, so shading, for

665
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,919
example, tree size, of course, um, and

666
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,640
leaf area, so how many leaves do you

667
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,559
have on this particular tree? Um, as

668
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,399
well as evaporative cooling. So, this

669
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,240
has to do with transpiration rates. How

670
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,000
much water can these trees actually pump

671
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,759
into the air to cool things down over

672
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,679
time, small density, things like that.

673
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,038
So, there's differences across species.

674
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
Um, but these aren't really included in

675
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,240
tree selection decisions. Um, the most

676
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,799
you'll probably get from these sort of

677
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,839
things is like, um, how big is this tree

678
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,038
going to get? Is it going to get in the

679
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,959
way of power lines or something like

680
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,079
that? And also, um, is this tree

681
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,000
actually going to survive in this

682
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,439
location? But in terms of a lot of these

683
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,599
species level differences, we don't

684
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,720
really have that information. And we

685
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,798
don't really have good information about

686
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,038
what trees are where in the city of New

687
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,720
York. Um we have some information quite

688
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,240
a bit but we don't have information

689
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
about where they all are which is really

690
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,519
needed to reduce heat and health impacts

691
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,919
more precisely. Um so maps of tree tax

692
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,960
are really needed to reduce heat more

693
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,360
precisely in cities. And because of this

694
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,640
um we can actually estimate cooling at a

695
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,398
scale that's more relevant to urban

696
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,960
residents. Um, if you're thinking about

697
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,959
a large um, neighborhood area, a lot of

698
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,200
this uh, health analysis is done at like

699
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,120
census blocks or census block groups, it

700
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,159
may be shady and cool in one part of the

701
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,439
neighborhood but not the other part of

702
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,360
the neighborhood. And that's an issue

703
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,919
because if you're walking down the

704
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,678
street um, in your particular part of

705
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,880
town, um, if you don't have many trees

706
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
in your street, what does it matter that

707
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,880
that park has tons of trees just down

708
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,720
the road? Um, and so there are many

709
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,760
methods from remote sensing to do tree

710
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,600
identification, but getting down to

711
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,640
genus and species level stuff is just

712
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,398
pretty hard in general. Um, big issue is

713
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,240
that midsummer, uh, you may have

714
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,839
experienced this yourself, green trees

715
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,359
kind of all look the same. Um,

716
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,879
especially from multisspectral images

717
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,519
like a lot of the satellite data we

718
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,960
actually use. Um, but at certain times

719
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,720
of year, trees can look very different.

720
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,880
So, I'd like to show you one of the few

721
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,519
windows in Bradfield Hall. Um, this is

722
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,480
looking north. Um Dan took a bunch of

723
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,599
these pictures and um what you can see

724
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,558
here is that these are a few different

725
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,319
times of year. So summer on the top left

726
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,918
trees all look pretty green but spring,

727
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,000
early fall, late fall they look kind of

728
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,440
different. So if you're looking at this

729
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,038
particular tree over here, well it's

730
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,200
turning yellow while other trees are

731
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:24,158
sessing a little bit. Um but this one

732
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,519
over here um it's not quite the same

733
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,880
color as the other one. So perhaps

734
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,480
they're different species. Maybe we can

735
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,679
lean on this type of information to get

736
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,599
at um different types of seasonality. So

737
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,840
can we use deciduous phenology to

738
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,558
classify trees? And by phenology I mean

739
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,240
the seasonal timing of um different

740
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,240
events in nature. So in the case of

741
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,079
deciduous trees, when do they put out

742
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,839
leaves? When do they lose leaves? How

743
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,480
does this timing differ year to year in

744
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,558
between species? So urban trees have

745
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,319
been classified for multiple seasonal

746
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,079
images recently. So you take a big stack

747
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,398
of satellite data, you throw that all

748
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,720
into a big classifier. Um you can do

749
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,119
pretty well with that. Um but what there

750
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,079
haven't been before is that

751
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,158
classifications based on the time series

752
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,720
that actually deres uh the phenological

753
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,720
dates. So like what is a precise date

754
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,640
you could give to a model to say oh what

755
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,600
is the leaf out in the start of spring.

756
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,320
Um so what we can do is we're aiming to

757
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,398
identify taxonomic differences at fine

758
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,678
time scales. Uh which all sounds well

759
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,359
and good but actually getting the data

760
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,640
to do this is not the most

761
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,158
straightforward thing in the world. So

762
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,240
there are kind of some data requirements

763
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,320
to this. Um, one of the big trade-offs a

764
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,480
lot of the time with satellite imagery

765
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,720
is different types of resolutions.

766
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,000
Usually you can get pretty good uh

767
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,679
temporal resolution, so lots of

768
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,079
observations, but the pixels have to be

769
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,200
pretty big. Um, but if you're dealing

770
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,798
with something that you want to get lots

771
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,558
of precise measurements, you need high

772
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,240
spatial resolution as well. Um, so

773
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,158
fortunately, Planet is a commercial

774
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,519
satellite company and they have a

775
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,159
constellation of satellites called

776
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,558
Planet Scope that both has high spatial,

777
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
roughly 3 meters, and high temporal

778
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,918
resolution imagery. So you can get

779
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,599
observations almost every single day.

780
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,519
And the way they get around this is by

781
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,158
launching hundreds of these small sats

782
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,159
that take observations pretty often. Um,

783
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,600
so we can do that and lean on that to

784
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,840
look at individual trees and their

785
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,519
seasonal timing, but we also need good

786
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,480
label training data to actually predict

787
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,839
on. um you can't do uh a classification

788
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,240
without having some good training data.

789
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,798
And thankfully the city of New York has

790
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,558
um tree stem and ID database from a

791
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,398
street tree database where people

792
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,720
literally went out and hugged a million

793
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,599
trees in New York City and labeled them

794
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,360
um with different genus levels, cultivar

795
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,278
quality, status of the canopy, which is

796
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,398
awesome, but that's still less than 20%

797
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:35,839
of the total number of trees in New

798
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,158
York. So there's still a lot of places

799
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,480
that need to be filled in. Um, and also

800
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,760
you need a good tree crown polygon data

801
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,360
set because you actually need an object

802
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,960
that you're putting a label on.

803
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,558
Otherwise, you're just doing pixels and

804
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,440
it could be pretty noisy. So,

805
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,038
thankfully, um, there's already been,

806
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,240
um, classification of tree crown

807
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,079
polygons, um, from citywide LAR flights.

808
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,000
Um, we tried to make polygons ourselves

809
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,158
from LAR. Um, it's pretty challenging

810
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,798
and so we'll we're thankful that this

811
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,039
data set already exists. Um so the

812
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,200
research goals from this um examining

813
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,640
the differences the first step in this

814
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,278
and examining the differences in urban

815
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,559
tree phenology by taxa in New York City.

816
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:13,919
And so the main research questions for

817
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,000
this is how can satellite based

818
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,679
phenology be used to actually separate

819
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,839
urban deciduous tree taxa in New York

820
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,278
City. Uh one of the key things to keep

821
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,959
in mind and how why we're getting away

822
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,599
with this technique in place like New

823
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,519
York is that it's mostly deciduous trees

824
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,199
like over 90%. If you were doing this in

825
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,200
a place with a lot more evergreen trees,

826
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,399
like let's say Seattle or Miami, you'd

827
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,759
have a lot harder time doing this and

828
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,479
this may not be the best technique for

829
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,839
you. Um, some other questions, temporal.

830
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,519
So, what is the year-to-year variability

831
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:40,959
of spring leaf out? Like, in terms of

832
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,278
the start of season among different

833
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,038
types of trees, and also spatial. So,

834
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,119
how does spring leaf out vary spatially

835
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,480
across the city? Maybe you're a tree in

836
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,239
Manhattan, you're a real go-getter, you

837
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,679
leaf out early. Trees in Brooklyn, maybe

838
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,278
not. I don't know. It's So, we'll have

839
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,559
to just take a look at it.

840
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,679
Um, we're also going to look at the end

841
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,079
of season, but it's going to be a lot

842
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,519
more challenging. Um, so here's an

843
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,439
example of tree data in Flatbush,

844
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,038
Brooklyn. This is a little bit south of

845
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Prospect Park. Um, what's cool about

846
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,919
this neighborhood is that you have a lot

847
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,838
of single family homes with uh trees

848
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,119
individually um across this sort of um

849
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:14,480
central neighborhood, but larger

850
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,320
apartment blocks over on the side. So,

851
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,838
big differences in the amount of tree

852
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,039
cover you have. Each one of these

853
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,480
colored points is a street tree that the

854
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,159
parks and recck department actually

855
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,199
labeled and so different colors are by

856
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,639
different uh tree species. So there's a

857
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,759
lot of these points which is awesome but

858
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,358
there's still a lot of places that are

859
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
missing. So this is what this tree

860
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,039
polygon data set looks like on top of

861
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,639
that. Um and this is from the Nature

862
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,159
Conservancy and the University of Mont

863
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,519
Spatial Analysis Lab. Um so this data

864
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,280
set is really cool because we can

865
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,239
actually put labels to all these trees

866
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,960
for the places that are missing. Um, so

867
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,439
how do we actually get there? Um, we

868
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,639
have this map of tree stems from the New

869
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,119
York City parks and wreck. And what we

870
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,878
want is a final map of all the trees

871
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,720
labeled in New York City, right? No big

872
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,400
deal. It's fine. Um, how do we actually

873
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,239
get there? Uh, we use this planoscope

874
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
satellite time series, light our tree

875
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,919
crown polygons and structure and also

876
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,760
air temperature data to look at what

877
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,519
time of year should trees leaf out based

878
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,920
on accumulated how warm is this

879
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,079
different place um in the city. So for

880
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,680
each tree crown polygon, extract this

881
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,240
time series of reflectance from planet

882
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,719
scope um reflectance time series, clean

883
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,118
this up, extract key phenology data and

884
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,039
then also um light our structural

885
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,280
variables. So like how tall is the tree,

886
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,960
how big is the crown, what how dense is

887
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
the canopy and air temperature related

888
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,280
data. And so we have this suite of

889
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,079
different information all for this

890
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,839
individual tree.

891
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,039
Um, so we can use the labels of tree

892
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,880
stems from the New York City parks and

893
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,320
wreck as our reference training and

894
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,160
validation data set. So this is the

895
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
trees we know what they are and where

896
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,159
they are. And we can use that and

897
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,880
develop a classifier. Yes, I'm using

898
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,960
random forest to classify trees and

899
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,280
apply that classifier to all the unknown

900
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,519
tree polygons across New York. And tada,

901
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,519
we have New York City training data set.

902
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,800
Um, all completed for a final map trees

903
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,280
in New York. But I'm going to talk

904
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,480
mostly about this part up here. Um, in

905
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,119
terms of actually how we get the

906
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,559
phenology information out of this. So

907
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,119
here's from the National Agricultural

908
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,719
Imagery Program, NAPE. Um, if you've

909
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,960
looked at any agricultural data, you may

910
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,719
be familiar with it. They do it in New

911
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,358
York City as well. Um, so this is a true

912
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,799
color air photo from summer 2019, which

913
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,000
is great, but they only do this every

914
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,039
couple of years and right in the middle

915
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,679
of summer, so you can't get much

916
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,559
seasonality out of this. Um so this is

917
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,000
plant scope um which is slightly uh

918
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,320
coarser resolution but much more

919
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,320
observations. I'm showing it in a false

920
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,480
color composite near infrared red green

921
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,400
with near infrared and the red um

922
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,079
display. So plants reflect way more

923
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,358
light in the near infrared. And so

924
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,359
anything that you see on this map is

925
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,078
bright red. That's normally green plants

926
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,078
that you would see with your naked eye.

927
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,680
So here's phenology time series of a

928
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,519
particular oak tree, a very charismatic

929
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,118
one that's well behaved in the South

930
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,440
Bronx. Um, so that's what it is in the

931
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,440
NAPE imagery on the top left um, from

932
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,039
the street. And so this particular tree,

933
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm showing the plant scope imagery down

934
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,239
here. Um, and this is a time series of

935
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,000
NDVI through time. And you can see as it

936
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,598
gets bright red in the spring, that's

937
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,358
when it's greening up. And so this is

938
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,440
what we're tracking for every single one

939
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,199
of these tree crown polygons across New

940
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
York. And the actual value we're

941
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,439
tracking is the NDVI, which is a very

942
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,799
common satellite remote sensing index

943
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,720
where you're comparing the near infrared

944
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,560
to the red. As this number gets higher,

945
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,439
the plants are greener. Um, and we can

946
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,440
track this

947
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,519
year-over-year. So, for example, for all

948
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,760
the trees that we know, what they're

949
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,159
labeled, um, this is for all the maples

950
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,119
in New York City for 2018 from Planet

951
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,879
Scope. Um, so this you can see a lot of

952
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,559
these are sort of the first week of May

953
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,640
roughly, but you can do this

954
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,960
year-over-year. And so you have

955
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,039
approximate timing of leaf out

956
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,039
variability across every single year

957
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,000
that we have available. Um, you'll

958
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,719
notice there's some year-to-year

959
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,599
variability. For example, 2019 and 2022

960
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:57,919
tend to be a little bit later. Um, but

961
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,359
what what we can see is that when we can

962
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,960
separate this out further, you can get

963
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,199
down to species level as well. So, for

964
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,720
example, example, silver maple in the

965
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,039
middle here tends to be a little bit

966
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,439
later than red maple or Norway maple.

967
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,599
So, there are some different species

968
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,838
level differences we can get at as well.

969
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,359
Um, so we can do this for other genera.

970
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,279
So, for example, here is platinus. So,

971
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,719
they're plain trees or sycamores. One

972
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,000
thing you'll notice about this one is a

973
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,159
it tends to be a lot later than the

974
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,838
maples, which is uh reassuring because

975
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,480
they probably should be, but also this

976
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,799
year 2019 is super duper late. So we're

977
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,358
looking at like late May for this tree,

978
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,000
which is suspiciously late in some ways.

979
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:36,559
Um so how do we actually translate

980
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,920
phenology into a classification? Um one

981
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:40,880
thing to keep in mind is that this is

982
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,880
one particular year in 2019. Um and this

983
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,559
is just separated by different genre.

984
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,720
Um, and this is different months in the

985
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,159
spring box plots showing the

986
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,159
distribution of timing for the trees

987
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,358
that we know. So, for example, based on

988
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,519
this, we could do a pretty good job

989
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,920
separating glitzia, the honeyloust from

990
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,880
Acer, our maples. Um, but getting back

991
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,800
to platinus, it's way way later than

992
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,440
everything else. So, for example, we

993
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,440
should be able to readily separate this

994
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,760
genus based on it consistently spring

995
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,079
leaf out in 2019. What we think is going

996
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,640
on is that there is a anthrachnos fungus

997
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,920
causing delayed spring leaf out. This is

998
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,519
a fungus that causes the plants to

999
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,960
attempt to leaf out in the spring. Then

1000
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,800
it looks like they have frost damage or

1001
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,800
leaf wilt and the leaves kind of shrivel

1002
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,640
up and don't look that happy. Trees look

1003
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,680
bare until much later in the growing

1004
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,519
season. Then they get their act together

1005
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,719
by the end of May and you know summer

1006
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,280
goes on. Um but what we can do is that

1007
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,559
for an example test case on a

1008
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,960
classification we can lean on this and a

1009
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,320
few other um structural variables from

1010
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,960
the LAR and do like a prototype

1011
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,960
classification for the Bronx for

1012
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,679
platinus versus other generia genera

1013
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,838
just a split and so we get like a 93%

1014
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,440
overall accuracy in this. The big points

1015
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,920
that you see on here are the actual

1016
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,559
labeled street tree stems. Um and so

1017
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,480
everything else we label it as either

1018
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,799
platinus or something else. And so the

1019
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,039
blue you can see a lot of platinus are

1020
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,800
labeled in a lot of buildings where we

1021
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,079
uh around buildings where we don't have

1022
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
the street tree labels. So we're

1023
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,560
painting everything in um that we needed

1024
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,919
new labels for. And we can do this in a

1025
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,320
lot of bigger neighborhoods. So for

1026
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,639
example, this is a relatively large

1027
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,720
apartment blocks. Um and you can see

1028
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,559
that a lot of the trees that weren't

1029
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,559
included in that street tree database we

1030
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:24,078
can actually provide labels for based on

1031
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:25,838
this. Um so we can do an initial t test

1032
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,920
case on this but what about spatial

1033
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,639
variation in phenology? So we need some

1034
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,358
more information um based on temperature

1035
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:36,559
as well. So this is a temperature data

1036
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:40,960
set um that takes coarser resolution

1037
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,880
data downscales it based on um different

1038
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,199
uh structural parameters on the surface

1039
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,720
like green vegetation impervious surface

1040
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,000
things like that. Uh we didn't make this

1041
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,199
product, but what's really cool about it

1042
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,039
is that it's really high spatial

1043
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,199
resolution. So we can get pretty good

1044
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,079
information on what is the temperature

1045
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:58,078
accumulation for different trees. So

1046
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,480
what's important about that is that if

1047
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,079
you have different amount of

1048
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,838
temperatures in different locations in

1049
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,160
the city, you would expect, oh, if I'm

1050
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,920
in this location and it's this warm,

1051
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,399
well, what will my leaf out timing be

1052
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,720
for this genus versus this genus? If we

1053
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,519
have information about, okay, it leafed

1054
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,959
out here and it's this warm. Well, we

1055
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,559
have a much more better information

1056
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,000
about which is which. So, for two

1057
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,838
different genre, we might see different

1058
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,039
response patterns in air temperature.

1059
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,119
Um, and this is where we're kind of

1060
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,079
going next steps for this. One other

1061
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,400
thing that I've been dealing with the

1062
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,160
last week or so is looking at a webcam.

1063
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,160
Um, this is what's called a phenino cam.

1064
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,838
So, phenology camera. Um, this is at the

1065
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,920
top of um in northern Manhattan. Um, and

1066
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,838
this is just staring at this park all

1067
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,519
the time. So, this is St. Nicholas Park.

1068
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,838
Um here it is in um this is beginning of

1069
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,199
April

1070
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:49,519
2022. What they look at is like they

1071
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,439
take a polygon like this and then work

1072
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,559
through it through time. You can see the

1073
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,880
trees green up. And so just back of the

1074
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,039
envelope um comparing this sort of

1075
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,920
polygon shape that they have versus the

1076
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,679
trees in this polygon. Uh 2022 we're

1077
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,280
roughly the same time. May 3rd, April

1078
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,440
29th, which isn't too bad. um 2023 we're

1079
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,720
a couple weeks off but um in digging

1080
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,559
into the data there may be some issues

1081
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,159
with the phenocam and there may be some

1082
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,440
issues with the plant scope imagery so

1083
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,358
take that one with a grain of salt for

1084
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,280
now um but what I'm working on now um is

1085
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,119
examining individual trees so taking

1086
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,800
little boxes of trees and tracking those

1087
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,920
through time individually

1088
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,000
um so just some implications for this um

1089
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,159
phenology shows promise as a way of

1090
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,679
identifying urban tree taxa uh so we

1091
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,279
have this platinus classifications of

1092
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,279
proof of concept. And there's

1093
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,359
separability that currently exists for

1094
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,760
other genre, but we're going to build on

1095
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,039
this and include temperature phology

1096
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,040
relationships and lots of other things

1097
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,960
in order to do a better classification.

1098
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,639
And so the goal will be well, we're not

1099
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,000
going to get every single species across

1100
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,239
the entire city. There's just too many

1101
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,480
of them. But we can get a lot of the

1102
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,000
most populous species. Uh we won't get

1103
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,760
populist, that's not in here, but we'll

1104
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,599
get a lot of other things. So methods

1105
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,839
have potential to be scaled spatially

1106
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,838
and temporally. Um, so we could do this

1107
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,519
across multiple years if we needed to.

1108
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,039
And the eventual goal will be to create

1109
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,480
a scalable pipeline that can be applied

1110
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,559
to other cities. So if you live in

1111
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,800
Cleveland or Chicago or I don't know,

1112
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,920
Ithaca, if you had the data, we could do

1113
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,680
something like this, which would be

1114
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,159
pretty cool. Um, you'll notice I didn't

1115
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,919
talk about health at all for the last, I

1116
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,078
don't know, 16 minutes. So what's the

1117
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,079
big picture for this? Um, we're going to

1118
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,960
link tree identity to public health

1119
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,400
decisions. And

1120
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,199
so my corner, Dan's corner of the

1121
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,079
project is in this tree tax of

1122
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,519
classification, mapping trees in New

1123
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,519
York using the remote sensing and the

1124
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,358
phenology product. Um, but what we're

1125
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,199
actually planning to do is hand off this

1126
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,440
information to colleagues in civil

1127
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,919
engineering um in Professor Chi Lee's

1128
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,679
group to do genus level classification.

1129
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,318
Uh, take that genus level classification

1130
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,318
and turn it into an urban heat model. So

1131
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,480
they have a model that can run at pretty

1132
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,000
high spatial resolution, roughly 100

1133
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,760
meters or however much they want to

1134
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,239
define it. Um, and include that

1135
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,480
information on tree structure and

1136
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:05,598
cooling to be able to have better

1137
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,639
information on what is the condition in

1138
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,119
different neighborhoods at a scale

1139
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,039
that's relevant to people. Um, so when

1140
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,838
we have that sort of temperature and

1141
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,440
heat information that can be used

1142
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:18,719
related to epidemiology and social

1143
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,240
justice. So assessing marginal effects

1144
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,480
species on like emergency department

1145
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,838
visits like if you have certain amount

1146
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,240
of certain types of trees in a

1147
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:26,880
neighborhood, comparing those

1148
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:28,399
neighborhoods, how many department

1149
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,519
visits do you have during heat waves or

1150
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,119
other times a year and also those uh

1151
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,719
different types of health effects of

1152
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,680
these trees into urban greening

1153
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,519
decisions and public health policies. Um

1154
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,719
so that includes colleagues at wild

1155
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:45,280
Cornell um including Arnav Gosh and Wesi

1156
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:49,838
um colleagues in natural resources and

1157
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,000
also in other um parts of um around New

1158
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,000
England as well. Um and so additional

1159
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
acknowledgements um colleagues at the

1160
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,519
Nature Conservancy and the Natural Areas

1161
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,079
Conservancy, two separate organizations

1162
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,318
with similar sounding names um and some

1163
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,760
other information were um from

1164
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,039
colleagues at American University and

1165
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
CUC Santa Barbara to help with the PL

1166
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,199
and scope data. So, I'm going to leave

1167
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,040
this up for the end and feel free to ask

1168
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,759
any questions and thanks for your time.

1169
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,358
So, many cities are considering what's

1170
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,800
going to happen with climate change and

1171
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,159
how that's going to have to change the

1172
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,079
kinds of trees they plant in a given

1173
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:29,118
location. Are you contemplating

1174
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,240
those issues in your in your work? Yeah.

1175
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,920
So the question is about

1176
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:35,598
um with climate change is that

1177
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,119
information in terms of what the tree

1178
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,720
species pallet should be um included in

1179
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,400
our work and how we're we're looking at

1180
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:44,159
that. Um we're not addressing that

1181
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,880
specifically, but that is definitely a

1182
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,000
question longer term. Um and it could be

1183
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,400
something where you look at different

1184
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,679
parts of the city and say, "Oh, this

1185
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,440
part of the city is warmer. You could

1186
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:56,000
use the survivability in this part of

1187
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,838
the city to compare and project in other

1188
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,318
parts." Um there's stuff being done in

1189
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,400
terms of like moving different genotypes

1190
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,719
and planting those that are from further

1191
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,160
south. Um so we're not dealing with that

1192
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:10,279
end specifically, but that's definitely

1193
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,279
a consideration for sure.

1194
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,599
Uh I really like the uh the animation,

1195
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,480
the time series animation with the DVI

1196
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,880
going up and down. I was expecting that

1197
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,920
thing to kind of plateau and stay kind

1198
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,838
of high fairly level, but it's kind of

1199
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,318
it peaks and then starts going down. Is

1200
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,279
this uh typical of all trees doing this

1201
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:34,559
or is this something that could be used

1202
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,560
uh for uh maybe differentiating trees?

1203
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,639
Yeah. So that's pretty typical for for

1204
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,559
trees. It peaks and then it's Yeah. And

1205
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,318
you get you get a peak and like around

1206
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,559
Juneish and then it slowly kind of

1207
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:46,639
declines through the summer. Um it's

1208
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,799
still a dense canopy through the summer.

1209
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,159
It's just they're not as bright vibrant

1210
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,039
as you would have first thing in the

1211
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:56,118
growing season. Um so yeah, that plateau

1212
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:59,279
isn't necessarily totally flat.

1213
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,920
Yeah, really cool.

1214
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,319
Yeah, that was great. Thank you. It's so

1215
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,159
nice to hear more about what you've been

1216
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,759
working on. Um, kind of related to this

1217
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,879
last question. I'm curious if um like

1218
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,800
there are other um like land surface

1219
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,318
phenology metrics besides just start

1220
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,599
season and end of season that kind of

1221
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,039
describe that curve um in more detail.

1222
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,160
Have you guys looked at how some of

1223
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,239
those other metrics might vary across

1224
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,039
the species in terms of helping to parse

1225
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,358
those out? Uh, so the question is about

1226
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,880
um other land surface phenology metrics

1227
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,639
besides just start of season and end of

1228
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,400
season. Uh, and we've looked into it.

1229
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:35,838
Um, but we haven't actually gotten too

1230
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,680
far with that yet. So there's other

1231
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:38,960
stuff we can fit in that curve besides

1232
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,118
what I'm showing as start of season, end

1233
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,199
of season. It's just like the 50% point

1234
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,280
on these S-shaped like these sigmoid

1235
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,719
curves. But you can do different times a

1236
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,079
year and a lot of these other phenology

1237
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,799
models will do stuff where they have

1238
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,800
like here's the max, here's this mid

1239
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,000
mids slope decline, lots of other things

1240
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,119
like that. Um, I think for now we're

1241
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,639
just going to stick with these and then

1242
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,880
build out from it. One thing we actually

1243
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,559
want to try to do is actually lean on

1244
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,440
the color component of it more and see

1245
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,318
if we can pick out individuals that have

1246
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,200
really distinct color situations uh

1247
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,838
different parts of the year. for

1248
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,279
example, like GKO trees, like that GKO

1249
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,119
tree out there turned like this electric

1250
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,440
yellow in the fall and if we can capture

1251
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,960
that, that would be really helpful. Um,

1252
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,200
so yeah, I want to think about that more

1253
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,199
for sure.

1254
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,880
Does your system allow you to um capture

1255
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,480
like invasive trees? I mean, I'm

1256
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,440
thinking, you know, New York City, Tree

1257
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,280
of Heaven, Bradford pears, which, you

1258
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,358
know, a lot of folks certainly wouldn't

1259
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,880
want to see or at least an increasing

1260
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,679
number. So, I'm just wondering, have you

1261
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,200
come across that as being an issue?

1262
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,358
Yeah, I mean, if so, the question is

1263
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,199
about can we capture invasive trees? And

1264
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,519
the answer is if if they're in the data

1265
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,960
set already and there's enough of them,

1266
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,280
we can probably label them. Um, we don't

1267
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,358
have 100% like what the classification

1268
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
level is going to be, but heaven, um,

1269
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,880
Atlantis, there's enough of them that we

1270
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,400
should be able to get those. Um, but if

1271
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,559
they don't currently exist, so there's

1272
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,200
very few, it's they won't show up in the

1273
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:09,119
classifier. Yeah, unfortunately.

1274
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:11,118
Nice talk. Dave, I have a question

1275
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,119
coming back to your very original

1276
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,440
motivation like the cooling different

1277
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,680
cooling factor from different species.

1278
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,880
Um I was wondering how your class map

1279
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,879
can be combined with ET like M is doing

1280
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,280
to do the optimize like special

1281
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,920
distribution of different tree species

1282
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,040
uh to

1283
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,119
basically to best mitigate the the heat

1284
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:37,679
um way in in the future. I think that

1285
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,200
that's probably most important. And also

1286
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,919
the second question is have you

1287
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,358
considered the uh air quality impact

1288
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,760
because a lot different trees in many

1289
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,679
like iso prints right that's a huge air

1290
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,680
quality issue. So I think the

1291
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,279
optimization like with the different

1292
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,919
cooling effect and also air quality

1293
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,079
should be included in your like the

1294
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,519
downstream work.

1295
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,160
Thanks. Yeah. So the first question is

1296
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,920
about um looking at um different species

1297
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,078
types and the vapor transpiration and

1298
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,400
how their cooling will be included in

1299
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,079
the model. um we're talking about that

1300
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,240
and we're not 100% sure how that's going

1301
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,480
to slot in exactly. The first factor is

1302
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,838
leaf area index of course um which is

1303
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,318
just the amount of leaves you have over

1304
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,558
the surface. Um but what we would like

1305
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:21,199
to do is look at like the tri database

1306
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,920
and look at different species um cooling

1307
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,719
capacities and be able to work with the

1308
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,960
restly um to include what we can in the

1309
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,118
model. Um so that's still a work in

1310
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,159
progress. Um the second question is

1311
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,920
about um air quality measurements and uh

1312
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,598
I I know Dan's very interested in air

1313
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,880
quality. Uh so yeah, we've been talking

1314
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,280
about some of the stuff related to

1315
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,680
pollen and um but other things related

1316
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,280
to like VOCC's. Um we'll talk about that

1317
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,078
more because there's a lot of cool

1318
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,480
implications that can come out of a

1319
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:53,760
classification once once we have it. But

1320
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,639
yeah, thanks. All right. This has been a

1321
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:01,400
production of Cornell University on the

1322
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,400
web at cornell.edu. edu.
