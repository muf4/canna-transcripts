1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,040
University all right and with that uh

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,400
what I'm actually going to be talking to

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,799
you about today is about the uh post

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,399
Harvest Apple

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,800
microbiome and summarizing uh the work

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,959
I've been doing for the last five years

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
at

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,760
Cornell right so just introduce one of

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,839
the things that uh I think we can

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,560
sometimes take for granted and I

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,480
certainly take took for granted before

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:33,519
starting

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,039
program at Cornell is how we can just

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
walk into a grocery store and see all

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,200
this amazing fresh produce months after

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,960
harvest in the case of uh something like

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
apples that right now apples have been

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,480
harvested harvested mostly in like

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,399
September with a little bit of like

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,839
August and October but you can walk into

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,439
a grocery store now and see New York

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
apples that were harvested from that

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:57,920
previous season uh right in the grocery

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,680
store and they uh look and taste great

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,439
so how do we actually uh

27
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,760
make that happen right and the answer is

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,239
with a variety of post Harvest

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,799
Technologies and the way we tend to

30
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,478
approach this in science is uh by

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,280
looking at okay what are the issues and

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,239
how and how do we solve them so there's

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,439
this big issue with fresh produce where

34
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,280
uh a large percentage that in some cases

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,599
this is like lowballing it um 24% of of

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,640
fruits and vegetables are lost before

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,438
reaching consumers right so big issue

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,439
and right again as I mentioned as

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,078
scientists we' like to think about why

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,599
why does this happen um and so there are

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:41,279
a lot of different ways that food can go

42
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:44,519
bad so uh there are sort of what what do

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
you think of as like food naturally um

44
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,519
going bad through uh ripening is

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,040
inessence which is based on cellular

46
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,840
respiration the fruit has metabolism it

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,520
go through all of its energy and then it

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,159
starts to break down uh and then water

49
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,798
loss is also a big deal especially in a

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,359
lot of leafy greens that even with a

51
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,880
little bit of water loss they'll shovel

52
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,239
up

53
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:08,639
um then we have uh molds and and

54
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,400
rots and and in these uh in horor

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,878
culture we call these post Harvest

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,080
pathogens that will infect the fruit and

57
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,560
of course these are very dangerous

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,920
because they'll spread and then we also

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
have a physiological disorders a common

60
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,238
example is something as simple as Apple

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,120
Browning so you bite into an apple and

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,480
it's kind of brown and gross it's not

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,840
moldy like it's not dangerous it's just

64
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,399
not what you really want uh from an

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,878
apple and so we have all these issues

66
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,159
that we have to deal

67
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,318
with right and so one of the the main

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,719
things that we want to do to preserve

69
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,919
the shelf life is to slow

70
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,759
respiration right because that slows

71
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:48,000
rping inessence uh process the most

72
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,639
effective thing we do for a lot of uh a

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
lot of these problems is Refrigeration

74
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,518
one of the things that I learned taking

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,519
uh po Harvest classes with uh Chris and

76
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,280
uh and and uh Dr uh suang Dan doing our

77
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,480
research is how important Refrigeration

78
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,158
is like refrigerate refrigerate

79
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,119
refrigerate and then there are some

80
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,199
other more specific Technologies we can

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,759
also use that if you reduce the

82
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,919
oxygen uh plants need oxygen to process

83
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,439
for their cellular respiration to

84
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,958
process energy like we do and then that

85
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,359
can limit respiration as long as it

86
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,200
doesn't get too low and you get

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,560
fermentation and then there's also this

88
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,959
plant hormone ethylene that mediates a

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,319
lot of this ripening inessence that we

90
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,519
can control right so apples are what is

91
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,639
known as a climacteric fruit that uh

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,319
through development through this

93
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,238
ripening phase you see that there's this

94
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,438
big burst of ethylene and then shortly

95
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,200
after you get this big burst of uh

96
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,400
respiration right which creates uh leads

97
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,958
to a lot of ripening inessence right and

98
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,239
in a fruit like strawberry which the

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,158
graph gives here for comparison we don't

100
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,120
see that right so some fruits do have

101
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,639
this climic some don't apples do and

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
that means that if we have this uh

103
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,639
showing this chemical pathway for

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,680
ethylene if we're able to inhibit it at

105
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,919
certain points

106
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,360
these two compounds uh one mCP and AVG

107
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,559
are ones that uh the Watkins lab very

108
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,680
commonly

109
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,360
uses and that are very commonly used in

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,519
the industry if we can inhibit ethylene

111
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,319
we can preserve the shelf

112
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,918
life right and then the other issue one

113
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:23,240
of the other issues I mentioned is water

114
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:25,879
loss um and so uh H how do we uh prevent

115
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,280
that the big way is when we uh

116
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,038
refrigerate in big storage rooms and we

117
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,638
try to keep it very humid for the

118
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:37,839
produce that uh 95% relative humidity is

119
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,519
the common Benchmark um but of course

120
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,638
there's a problem with humid conditions

121
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,680
and if anyone's a plant pathologist

122
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,199
seeing the water all over these apples

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,478
this might be a cause for a heart attack

124
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,520
um because uh when you get a lot of

125
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,959
moisture on apples that's just or or or

126
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,079
on anything as as you might expect

127
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,079
that's just inviting rots and molds in

128
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,680
right it's very intuitive if something

129
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,839
gets super wet mold will grow on it and

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,519
we don't want that on our food

131
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,719
right and so balancing all of these

132
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,120
approaches is

133
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,039
tricky um and we can control most of

134
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,879
these post haris pathogens with

135
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:13,560
fungicides which have some regulatory

136
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,839
concerns and even if you don't care

137
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,038
about that the one thing that really

138
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,119
struck me is that uh it's becoming more

139
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:21,038
and more difficult to develop new

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,879
fungicides you've already found all the

141
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,800
easy modes of action we're really

142
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,478
struggling to find new ones we need new

143
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,319
approaches in addition to the fungicides

144
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:33,079
we already use so one that's being

145
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,240
uh investigated is bio

146
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,439
control which the principle of it is to

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,519
use uh to simplify to use the good

148
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,399
microbes to fight off the Bad microbes

149
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,918
that you have a good like bacteria or a

150
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,638
yeast that will fight off and the the

151
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,318
bad uh postar

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,360
pathogens uh and and protect the fruit

153
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,240
and so there are some commercial

154
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,319
products available for these um but

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,160
they're less common than conventional

156
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,960
fdes for a couple of reasons that

157
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,240
they're a bit more expensive and they

158
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,159
can work as well but they're a bit more

159
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,000
uh that that you have to have the right

160
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,000
context for them so they're not quite as

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,399
consistent can apply to every situation

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,399
even though they have a lot of

163
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,959
potential um and so a lot of the uh

164
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,879
people who look at uh bio control when

165
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,799
when this uh microbiome concept started

166
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,879
were really interested because uh that

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,840
they had the

168
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,759
idea that instead of just using this bio

169
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,560
control antagonist to attack the

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,360
pathogen that there can be all these

171
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,399
interactions with the microbes that just

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,919
have to be on the fruit

173
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,239
surface right and so that leads to

174
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,719
developing theories of how can we

175
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,439
actually use the microbiome for

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,520
biocontrol and so that was uh where a

177
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,079
lot of the kind of early Theory early I

178
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,639
say as in like 10 years ago because this

179
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:51,680
field is very new um theory around

180
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,240
uh the the fruit

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,439
microbiome microbiome comes from and one

182
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,280
of the things that people have taken

183
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,918
from other microbiome studies is this

184
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,318
idea of the holom which originated from

185
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,519
the idea of the human microbiome which

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,919
and to be clear this is not the only way

187
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,839
people view the human microbiome but

188
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,560
it's one framework people use is that we

189
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,918
as humans

190
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,360
are a a sum of not just our own

191
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,399
physiology and not just our own actions

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,319
but of constant interactions between us

193
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,878
and the microbes in and on us so

194
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,560
everything we do is not just human

195
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,400
physiology it's human physiology

196
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,199
interacting with microbial phology and

197
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,918
microbial

198
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,038
ecology and so people have said why

199
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,198
don't we apply that to fruits as well

200
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,598
that there are all these microbes living

201
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,199
in and on fruits there have got to be

202
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,399
these constant

203
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,800
interactions there that that that can

204
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,758
shape all sorts of outcomes and if we

205
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,520
can just study these microbiomes maybe

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,560
we can then figure out more about the

207
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:52,120
fruits right and so that leads into my

208
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,319
work so we have this uh postar

209
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,598
physiology

210
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,560
element of trying to create to trying to

211
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,279
make sure that uh fruit lasts longer uh

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,079
deal with the issues that AR

213
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,000
and combining that with microbial

214
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,639
Ecology of we we know that there are

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,639
these microbes on surface of fruits what

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,639
are they what are they doing how can we

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
use those right so that's what I've

218
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,400
essentially been working on for the last

219
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,919
uh five years and then a couple years

220
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:21,758
ago I gave a presentation for the work I

221
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,959
did uh for Masters which is AVG as a

222
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,598
reminder this is one of the chemicals

223
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,198
that inhibits ethylene so all you need

224
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,639
to know is that it slows down ripening

225
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,520
and slows down sin

226
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,560
Essence um was so it was associated with

227
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,838
bacterial but not a fungal microbiome

228
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:40,278
variation in Gaya apples and so we

229
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,880
hypothesized that okay if we change if

230
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,759
we manipulate fruit

231
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,240
maturity um with this chemical that

232
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,120
should change what microbes we find on

233
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,159
there we found that it was true for

234
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,799
bacteria but they didn't find evidence

235
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,919
for uh fungi um

236
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,240
but one of the things about apples I

237
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,799
mentioned the clima Turk is that Gaya

238
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,560
apples don't have a very strong don't

239
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,439
have a very pronounced climac Turk that

240
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,159
its ethane goes up a little bit but uh

241
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,720
with this new variety uh Snap Dragon uh

242
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,879
which great apples if you live in the um

243
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,320
Northeast Us by the way highly recommend

244
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:16,399
um that that those have a much more

245
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,079
pronounced climic tur so we asked uh C

246
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,000
can we see

247
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:22,599
effects uh with this other cabar and

248
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,440
then with that we other we also wanted

249
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,639
to um

250
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,200
expand the

251
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,078
uh the the experimental design to look

252
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
at Harvest Time as well that here again

253
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:36,319
we have this very simplified pathway

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,360
where AVG chemical stops ethylene and

255
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,120
because ethylene leaves hering inessence

256
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,639
you can use AV to to create apples that

257
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,159
will last longer through

258
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,720
storage

259
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,439
um and we're also looking at at

260
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,560
manipulating aurity just through Harvest

261
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,760
times that we

262
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,039
harvested very early earlier than you

263
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,639
would typically Harvest apples and also

264
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,319
later then you would typically Harvest

265
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,600
apples right and so what were our

266
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,640
hypotheses

267
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,920
we predicted that this AVG this ethylene

268
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,278
inhibitor would uh affect microbiome due

269
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,719
to ethylene mediating some some uh

270
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:16,600
microbial interactions so ethylene

271
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,320
um we we're mostly concerned with it

272
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,600
because uh of its effect on ripening it

273
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,600
it also is known to have some effects on

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,879
uh plant defense right in addition for

275
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,399
to

276
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:32,078
uh to that we uh predicted Harvest Time

277
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,679
will influence the microbiome due to

278
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,919
some ecological principles Community

279
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,078
succession and turnover that the longer

280
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,879
the apples are there the more time the

281
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,078
mics have to colonize and that will

282
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,958
change the

283
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,359
community um and then we have we we

284
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,759
predict that the uh we also stored the

285
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,120
apples and predict that that would the

286
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,559
microbiomes due to this different

287
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,679
environment uh that they're

288
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,759
in right um so the sampling procedure

289
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,919
I'm not going to go through through this

290
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,799
for every experiment um

291
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,599
but uh essentially we had a few

292
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,519
different

293
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,079
treatments that we had our chemical

294
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,919
application that we

295
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:14,399
had this e inhibitor ABG we had uh two

296
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:16,278
Harvest times that were three weeks

297
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,919
apart so again like earlier and later

298
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,838
than you would typically Harvest

299
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,599
apples and then three storage

300
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,920
times uh with lot of application to get

301
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,519
a lot of good samples um and then the

302
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,078
process of actually sampling the

303
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,720
microbiome

304
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,039
it's kind of entertaining uh some people

305
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,360
when I explain it it's you put these

306
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,559
apples uh in a bag um you have a machine

307
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,079
it shakes them around a lot um with with

308
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,319
this uh solution and then you filter all

309
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:43,879
the liquid through onto this filter

310
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,278
paper and get this uh Grime which has

311
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,679
all the microbes in it and then you can

312
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:51,120
store it at the bottom of this tube and

313
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:53,638
then do typical DNA extractions and

314
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,360
sequencing right and again not going to

315
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,680
go through this for every experiment um

316
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,320
but we have our rdna extraction um and

317
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,759
then at this point point you shift the

318
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,839
samples off to a company who does the

319
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,200
sequencing and the way microbiome

320
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,839
sequencing is typically done is with

321
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,879
these small amplicons um so sequencing

322
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,040
entire big genomes of microbes is pretty

323
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,480
expensive but we can sequence a small

324
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,639
region of a ribosomal subunit to tell

325
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,879
what's what

326
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,240
essentially um and then we can do a

327
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,000
bunch of uh btics process the sequence

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,600
to get these feature table of we have a

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,198
sample and then these are all different

330
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,399
uh microbes and we get relative counts

331
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,519
of each to see how much of each microbe

332
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,759
is there that's the kind of

333
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,159
highle explanation and so here first I'm

334
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,000
going to show the ethylene data and it

335
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,799
looks about what we expect that when uh

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,759
we apply uh AVG we

337
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:52,479
see that the ethylene is greatly reduced

338
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,198
um and that the uh early Harvest apples

339
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,399
continue to get e after storage where

340
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,479
when we Harvest them late when they

341
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,320
already kind of hit especially for the

342
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,759
control ones they've hit that uh point

343
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,839
of the clima Turk the ethene

344
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,958
um production

345
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,560
decreases right and then going into the

346
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,599
actual uh

347
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:15,799
microbiome data uh I like to give a an

348
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,639
overview explanation of these uh

349
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,198
ordinations when I each time I do these

350
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,879
presentations because I know that

351
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:25,159
interpreting these multivariate data is

352
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:27,799
isn't something that everyone always

353
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,958
does their job so essentially for for

354
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,799
these each point is

355
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,078
a microbiome which for these sample is

356
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,679
for

357
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,399
apples um and the points that are

358
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,039
further apart have more different

359
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,360
microbiomes so the points that are

360
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,719
similar together have more similar

361
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,278
microbiomes the points that are further

362
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,000
apart have different microbiomes and

363
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,838
because uh we find hundreds of different

364
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,480
of microbes we're not able to make these

365
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,959
generalizations about like what's a good

366
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
microbiome or a bad microbiome all we

367
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,559
can say is that when we take all these

368
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,519
hundreds of microbes microbi microbes

369
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,719
together to form the microbiomes these

370
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,320
ones tend to look more similar to each

371
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,199
other and these ones look uh different

372
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,920
and so the main thing we see is that the

373
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,479
darker points that represent the later

374
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,479
storage time tend to Cluster differently

375
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,159
from the lighter points and then we see

376
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,800
that the late harvested ones these blue

377
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,319
ones also cluster a bit differently from

378
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:24,319
the uh early Harvest points and then we

379
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,879
can also do some statistics on this and

380
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,639
uh partially because it's is a

381
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,679
summarizing like PhD work as part of the

382
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,919
uh part part of the fence we're going to

383
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,758
have to get a little nitty-gritty into

384
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,799
the stats um and it's also like

385
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,680
important for the story of why I did

386
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:43,278
what but I'll try to not go like uh too

387
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:46,399
deep into it the main thing we were

388
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:49,240
really curious about um AVG and we did

389
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,440
find the uh the these initial ones are

390
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,680
are P

391
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,079
values um and so we did find a

392
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,439
significant P value that were the the

393
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,638
the chance of seeing these differences

394
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,440
is uh pretty low due to random chance

395
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,039
there's prob a treatment effect but

396
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,720
you'll notice the r squared for all of

397
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,679
these is pretty low so only uh in in

398
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,000
bacteria only 3% of the variation is

399
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,319
explained

400
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,078
by uh this the the this ethylene

401
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,879
inhibitor application and for people who

402
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,479
work on Univar data are probably

403
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,958
thinking uh 3% is like nothing for an r

404
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,839
squared that like how do you even get a

405
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,599
significant result and again the answer

406
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,480
is multivari data is very complicated

407
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,120
that 3% of the uh

408
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,720
microbiome of of differences in the

409
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,159
microbiome across hundreds or maybe even

410
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,160
thousands of different microbes if we

411
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,159
see it consistently enough that can give

412
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,000
us a significant result so it does look

413
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,719
like yeah it's doing something but the

414
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
actual variation it's

415
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,440
explaining uh is isn't the largest and

416
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that was something that kind of kept me

417
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,120
thinking for a while

418
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,278
afterwards and we see pretty similar

419
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,879
things for uh fungi that Harvest Time

420
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,078
storage time and this chemical

421
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,600
application this ethylene inhibitor

422
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:04,120
significantly shift in the

423
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,959
microbiome here the r squ is 04 it's

424
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,839
explaining 4% of the

425
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:11,879
variation right and we were able to find

426
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,519
some uh cool results with this my

427
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:17,318
favorite one was uh doing this uh stats

428
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,519
analysis to look at the direction of the

429
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,439
shifts and we see that uh all all the

430
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,000
red ones are uh are factors that that

431
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,440
significantly predict microbiome

432
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,600
variation um and so what we see is when

433
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,040
we apply AV

434
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,440
G the microbiome shifts the opposite

435
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,198
direction as late Harvest so the same

436
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,120
direction as we would expect from early

437
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,519
Harvest right and so it's a little

438
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
complicated to work my head through like

439
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,360
it took me a while to think about this

440
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,000
but what that essentially means is

441
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,360
that uh when the fruit is less mature

442
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,078
either due to having an AVG application

443
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,440
or due to being early harvested and

444
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,278
going in this direction that shifts the

445
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,079
microbiome in a similar Direction so the

446
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,958
microbiome is really tied to this

447
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,278
physiology that if you're able to

448
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,518
manipulate the maturity by either

449
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:07,880
harvesting early or by using a chemical

450
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,959
to uh reduce ethylene uh production that

451
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,079
shifts the microbiome in the same way so

452
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,160
that was a cool

453
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,279
result um and we got a good paper out of

454
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,558
it with

455
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,599
the last thing we did with this study

456
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:24,678
being looking at uh shotgun metagenomics

457
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:27,359
so I mentioned that uh when we look at

458
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,080
uh when we do sequencing for microbiomes

459
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,839
we tend to just look at a small region

460
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,319
of the genome to tell what's what um but

461
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,558
that doesn't actually tell us what the

462
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:40,200
genes are that these microbiomes

463
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:41,960
have and so uh what what we did was uh

464
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,679
this shotgun magic sequencing which does

465
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,640
sequence at random the entire microbiome

466
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,880
which we can use to to predict what

467
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,559
genes are there and see what these

468
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,880
microbes are actually

469
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:53,440
doing um and we did find some

470
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,720
interesting results that I wish I had

471
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,880
time to dig into but there's already a

472
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,120
lot of of uh there are already a lot of

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,559
data here but the main thing is is in in

474
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,798
most in large part due to the fact that

475
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,319
we weren't able to sequence as many

476
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,359
samples

477
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,359
um uh because the sequencing is much

478
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,519
more expensive when when we look at the

479
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,639
overall uh functional differences from

480
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,000
the predicted genes most of these are

481
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,559
bacterial um that we see some

482
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,359
differences due to storage time looking

483
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:25,399
from at Harvest uh to six months uh

484
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,558
combining some other data sets that I

485
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,280
also don't have time to talk about but

486
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,798
Harvest Time and AVG applic

487
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,639
don't result in uh significant

488
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:39,200
differences right so in summary we found

489
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,720
that uh our according to our hypothesis

490
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,919
this AVG chemical does have have an

491
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,519
effect on the microbiome and it's

492
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,960
similar to harvesting early because both

493
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,000
uh create less mature apples um but the

494
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,919
the actual like r squar value the amount

495
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,038
of variation explained by this AG is not

496
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,840
super high right and we see that uh

497
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,240
storage time is really the important

498
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,359
factor of bacterial composition and

499
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
function which is something we know from

500
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,119
the literature a lot of Studies have

501
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,400
looked at this and a lot of Studies have

502
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,239
found the same thing that storage time

503
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,400
is very important so that got me

504
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,200
thinking of like we got uh a great paper

505
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,400
out of this and then um my advisor Chris

506
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,519
asked a very good question and S to me

507
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,200
about this saying that the uh for PhD

508
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,440
you don't want to just think about doing

509
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,360
these separate studies you want to think

510
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,798
about well how do I build off of these

511
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,959
previous results when I looked at this

512
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:33,839
of what we were doing with maturity and

513
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,038
it's a very cool finding that they were

514
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,319
able to manipulate uh maturity and shift

515
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,960
the microbiome but I was looking at the

516
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,558
r squ values the effect values and I'm

517
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,480
like I think we just got to try

518
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,200
something different to see if we can

519
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,919
find a bigger effect that was my

520
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,279
conclusion and so next thing I looked at

521
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,679
were uh fungicides like surely the

522
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,440
things that Target the actual fungi

523
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,400
maybe we'll see really big effects with

524
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,558
those um so in this case we're looking

525
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,360
at fungicides and this uh skull

526
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,678
inhibitor this different chemical that

527
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,279
I'll uh be talking about as well so uh

528
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,080
starting with the

529
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,639
fungicides we have these two different

530
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,000
ones we have flu oino which is a

531
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,120
conventional fun side it's kind of what

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,159
you think of where uh you spray UND side

533
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:21,158
post Harvest on these apples that's food

534
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,880
oxol is a very common one mam is a

535
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,240
natural product compound so it's uh less

536
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,919
commercially used but it's available for

537
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,960
Organics and the main difference the the

538
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,640
reason experimentally we think that this

539
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,558
would be different is that flu oxil is

540
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,720
specifically designed to Target

541
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,839
pathogens whereas mamy is more broadly

542
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,519
toxic to

543
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,519
microbes um so we expect potentially uh

544
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,879
differences from there from how those

545
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,960
two

546
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,000
uh how the microb reacts to those two

547
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,200
and

548
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,640
then uh another Factor here is we have

549
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,159
this scold inhibitor that they were

550
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,320
testing so superficial scold you can see

551
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,880
these kind of pictures of these apples

552
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,119
that you probably wouldn't want to eat

553
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,840
um that it's caused by a variety of

554
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,239
abiotic factors um so this isn't a rot

555
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,639
or a mold it is just the the Apple

556
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,000
doesn't have everything it needs and

557
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,320
it's developing uh these issues right

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,200
and so we have this uh antioxidant um

559
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,558
DPA that that's used uh to

560
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,159
treat um superficial scull because a lot

561
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,599
of

562
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,720
uh what creates these physiologically

563
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,319
are oxidation reactions um

564
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,759
there are some regulatory concerns

565
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,960
around DPA where it's banned in Europe

566
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,119
um because it's like effect is very

567
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,319
powerful um as an antioxidant so we're

568
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,158
thinking okay like does that ship shift

569
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,558
the

570
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,720
microbiome if if we uh really change the

571
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:46,720
surface environment with this

572
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,278
antioxidant right and as previously we

573
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
wanted a post Harvest component we this

574
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:54,119
time we decided to look more at

575
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,798
shortterm because we looked at longterm

576
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,759
previously so like just 28

577
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,558
days um and then a room temperature

578
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,480
shelf life afterwards to address if the

579
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,720
fungicides really hit the

580
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,919
microbiome does it recover

581
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,600
quickly right and so we hypothesize that

582
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,400
when we target pathogens uh with these

583
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,678
fungicides that it will kind of disrupt

584
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,519
the entire community and

585
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,759
then uh similar methods I'm not going to

586
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,079
go over everything before of of the

587
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,038
sequencing we

588
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:29,240
used okay and so when we looked at the

589
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,960
um fungal data we find that the main

590
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,880
factor that shapes uh fungal communities

591
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,480
is the DPA the scald

592
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,840
inhibitor you can see these 95%

593
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,640
confidence ellipses that are overlapping

594
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,240
but they're clearly not identical

595
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,480
they're they're not in the exact same

596
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,480
place um and we see that the uh it is a

597
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,360
highly significant result and that the r

598
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,319
squ is 0.15 so 15% of the

599
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,079
variation uh of of what we see of of the

600
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,480
fungi on on the Apple surface can be

601
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:02,558
explained by adding this uh antioxidant

602
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,000
scald inhibitor right and the fungicide

603
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,918
we found was barely significant and when

604
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,480
we did parb we found that natomy the

605
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:16,640
organic broadly toxic to um microbes uh

606
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,200
fungicide had a had a small effect that

607
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
was barely significant and the

608
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,919
conventional fungicide that specifically

609
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,679
targeted pathogens um had no observable

610
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,559
effect and then we looked at bacteria

611
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,120
all of our treatments we didn't find

612
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,158
significant results what we did find is

613
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,879
the storage time heavily impacted uh the

614
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,039
microbiome where between the 14 and 28

615
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,919
days there was a big shift as you can

616
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,319
see and then when we took it out of act

617
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,720
room temperature it shifted back what it

618
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,960
was before so that's kind of an

619
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,400
interesting result

620
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,278
wasn't really uh exactly what we were um

621
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,720
looking to test

622
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,720
um with without uh the fun sides being

623
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,720
significant but I was pretty happy with

624
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,079
this that that we see that there are

625
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,400
these shifts that occur at Cold Storage

626
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,960
which we already know but what we didn't

627
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,519
know is that at least in the short term

628
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,038
they're somewhat reversible that we see

629
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,079
this big shift 14 and 28 days and that

630
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:11,440
it goes back to looking like how it did

631
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,519
in early storage if you take it out at

632
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,400
room temperature which could imply that

633
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,119
kind of the cold the the the cold uh

634
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,720
storage room

635
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,558
environment really is a a factor that

636
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,558
again um is

637
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,720
reversible right and so then I decided

638
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,599
to dig

639
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,038
into uh we we found that the DPA like

640
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,038
the applications of the antioxidant

641
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,759
scull

642
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,798
inhibitor um were had a big effect on

643
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:38,839
the fungi so what fungi is this actually

644
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,960
affecting right and so we found a few

645
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:43,119
different ones that were uh

646
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,798
significantly uh affected it's possible

647
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,599
that it's affecting more but when you

648
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,839
test hundreds of fungi you have to do uh

649
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,558
pretty strict multiple testing

650
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,599
correction so we're only seeing the ones

651
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,278
that are very significant um because if

652
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,079
you test hundreds of things um with just

653
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,599
a p .05 caught up you're just you're

654
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,240
going to get a lot that happen to um

655
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,038
come across as as significant even if

656
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,599
they're not just due to random chance um

657
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,200
so we're using a lot more uh stringent

658
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:12,839
cut off here

659
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,600
and the main thing is that this

660
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:18,000
aridium uh genus is uh very common on

661
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,879
the surface of apples it's a a yeast

662
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,798
that's known to have certain biocontrol

663
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,480
properties um and the one thing I was

664
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,480
able to find in in the literature which

665
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,240
kind of tied this together is that part

666
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,640
of its biocontrol action um

667
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:36,079
um is through um oxidative exerting

668
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,759
oxidative stress on on pathogens so by

669
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,678
sping the antioxidant it's not able to

670
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,440
do that maybe that

671
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,038
explains uh why why it's a lower

672
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,720
abundance when you add add the DP it's

673
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:50,960
not able to actually enact that bio

674
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,798
control as much um so in conclusion uh

675
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,919
see I'm still doing okay on

676
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,599
time then we have uh fungal composition

677
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,038
as I mentioned was associated with this

678
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,079
uh scalon

679
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,720
uh antioxident DPA and then bacterial

680
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,960
composition was associated with storage

681
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,038
time and then the skull

682
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,200
inhibitor uh the the main important

683
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:14,440
genus fact we found was on aridium and

684
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,919
then actually going back a bit this

685
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,038
cladosporium people might also know that

686
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,520
uh see that Inc increases in abundance

687
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,158
when you have DPA it's known to uh be a

688
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,119
mold most of the uh post Harvest on it

689
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,919
is that it

690
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:31,239
causes uh rotten grapes I wasn't able to

691
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,799
find a of it in apples um but that's

692
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,079
another thing to

693
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,359
consider um a table grap specifically

694
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,759
there's been some work where it's been

695
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,398
found as a as a

696
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,599
RW um and then one of the things that uh

697
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,798
surprised me when I looked through was

698
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,398
not exactly what I found but what I

699
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:49,038
didn't find was that when we looked at

700
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:51,439
um the abundance of

701
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,599
pathogens we saw that the uh

702
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,840
fungicides uh didn't shift the abundance

703
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,079
at all even if we didn't do the big

704
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,918
multiple testing correction I talked

705
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,359
about and just looked at which do these

706
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,840
have like what are the raw P values none

707
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,479
of them were close to being significant

708
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:09,879
when when we applied the uh

709
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,480
fungicides designed to um to control

710
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,799
them so after this I did some more

711
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
thinking about okay what do I want my

712
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,720
next step to be um thinking about a few

713
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,960
things that we

714
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,440
found DPA this uh the the this

715
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,399
antioxidant a strong effect on a fungi

716
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,278
but we didn't observe any effect on on

717
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:31,839
bacteria and the spici

718
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,798
sides um didn't seem to have a big

719
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,720
effect on the microbiome and also didn't

720
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,798
seem to have substantially reduced the

721
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,839
abundance of both Harvest pathogens

722
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,200
we're looking at which were both

723
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,839
consistent with the literature because I

724
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,200
was surprised by this so I went to see

725
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,119
how other people found the same thing

726
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,000
and other people have and no one really

727
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,918
has an explanation for it um is what

728
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,038
I've seen um so I thinking

729
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,600
about again going back that that all

730
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,640
these things we apply to try and

731
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,759
manipulate

732
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,038
microbiomes we can find consistent

733
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,398
results and we also got a very good

734
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,398
paper out of this but for my next

735
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:10,879
project I was thinking about the the the

736
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:12,439
biggest um results we found were due to

737
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,799
things like changing a big Harvest time

738
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,759
or leaving it in storage for a long time

739
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:21,319
these factors through time looking at

740
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,119
the kind of large scale ecology and then

741
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,359
again thinking about well we don't see

742
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,719
these big effect of ferdes on the things

743
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,519
we know they

744
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,360
control of that these kind of this large

745
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,798
scale Community ecology approach of

746
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,558
looking down and looking at all these

747
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:39,278
microbes doesn't always let us pick out

748
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:42,918
very specific interactions on

749
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,159
um uh on on on specific microbes if

750
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,640
they're not already so abundant that it

751
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:50,200
shifts around the entire community so

752
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,960
then I got to thinking what actual

753
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,840
questions can I take with this like a

754
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,798
community ecology lens that uh I I I I

755
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,798
think is very important right and so

756
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:05,639
that led me to look at more of these

757
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:07,359
spatiotemporal factors of how do the

758
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,679
microbes actually get onto the apple

759
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:13,398
fruit to begin with um and how can that

760
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,919
be explained by where they are in space

761
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,158
and time

762
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,519
and um this was a a fairly substantial

763
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,640
shift from what I had done before um

764
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,200
because right as you may remember the

765
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,759
title of my uh presentation is about um

766
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,000
PR and post Harvest treatments this

767
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:34,319
really isn't either it's looking about

768
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,599
the at the spatial end ecology and how

769
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,319
that changes Through Time right but

770
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,959
again looking

771
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,278
through my results seeing low r squared

772
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,640
values and not not not always the

773
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,200
effects we were

774
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,440
seeing I thought like this is where I

775
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,720
think uh we're actually going to find

776
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,240
the most important biological results

777
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,919
right and so getting into the actual um

778
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,599
what I did for this one you may remember

779
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,519
uh I I talked about uh these data at

780
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,719
Grandfield review I decided to also

781
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,679
include them here because they

782
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,720
uh they're they're pretty important for

783
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,320
like the story of what I actually did

784
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,480
and why and we'll be able to pick out um

785
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,200
some interesting Trends from it so uh

786
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,640
Island biogeography theory is a

787
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
classical ecology theory that you can

788
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,000
see here with this picture of birds that

789
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,558
basically states that the further away

790
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,599
the island is the less dispersal there's

791
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,398
going to be the less things can make it

792
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,558
so you're to find fewer different types

793
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:34,639
of of species there's going to be less

794
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,798
diversity just kind of makes sense right

795
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,960
that here we can see these birds all are

796
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:43,839
all able to get over here but here on

797
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,440
this island only one type of bird is uh

798
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,879
and I wondered is that true for apples

799
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,960
as well that are apples lower to the

800
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,159
ground and in this different canopy area

801
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,960
do those have different uh composition

802
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,679
and diversity due to differences due to

803
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,679
potentially differences in

804
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,679
dispersal

805
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:09,638
right and so our research questions here

806
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,879
were looking at these different canopy

807
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:15,759
areas the lower canopy the inner

808
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
canopy and outer canopy and we're

809
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,119
looking at do these have different

810
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,919
microbiomes um and we looked at a couple

811
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,959
of harvest times to make sure it was

812
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:29,799
um consistent only uh one week apart

813
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,759
this time and tracking tracking changes

814
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:35,599
through storage um and because we're

815
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,879
interested in looking at uh temporal

816
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,759
effects as well uh we wanted to look at

817
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,799
to to do a multi-year study this time so

818
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,759
this was a pretty big

819
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,359
undertaking uh and and again a little

820
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,839
risky in the sense that like it's not

821
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:51,278
using the bread and butter like post

822
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,839
Harvest uh te technologies that I was

823
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,440
using earlier

824
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:58,000
on PhD and so our hypothesis this time

825
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,320
is that in in accordance with this

826
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,159
biogeography theory that each of these

827
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,200
zones should have a different mic a

828
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,000
different microbiome because different

829
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,720
microbes um Can colonize at different

830
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,960
rates and and potentially even just due

831
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,360
to random chance that that of of what

832
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,919
makes it there

833
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:21,038
they uh should be different and then we

834
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,919
think that uh the lower canopies should

835
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,119
have the highest diversity

836
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,159
because more microb should be able to

837
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,119
get to he from the soil right so this

838
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,440
hypothesis really

839
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,278
implicates the soil as being important

840
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,840
right and so the main thing we found is

841
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:40,679
that uh between the years there's a lot

842
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,038
of variation explained um that for fungi

843
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,120
you can see that these cluster are very

844
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:45,000
separately for fungi and bacteria um

845
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:47,839
highly

846
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,398
significant our squared for fungi is uh

847
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,038
0.54 so 54% of all the differences we

848
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:55,038
see across the microbiomes for all of

849
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,440
our our fungal samples can be explained

850
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,480
by which one was in 2022 which one was

851
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,639
in

852
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,919
23 uh for bacteria

853
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:05,439
they uh microbes a lot more complicated

854
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,519
so the r squs tend to be a bit lower in

855
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,320
general uh 23 which is still a lot

856
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,880
higher than we've seen

857
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:15,000
before and then when we look at uh the

858
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,480
canop area we found that previously when

859
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
we had uh experiments it was things like

860
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,839
storage time that had the biggest impact

861
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,319
but in this study it was actually canopy

862
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,558
area that had the biggest effect on the

863
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,439
microbiome composition and we see that

864
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:30,319
for our two years for fungi we see these

865
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,919
again these wouldn't be high R squares

866
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,079
by univariate measures with like one

867
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,399
treatment and one response but for

868
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,398
hundreds of different microbes

869
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,599
explaining 20% of the variation that's

870
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:42,678
quite

871
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:45,798
substantial um and then for bacteria we

872
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,840
see the same where we we we see a a good

873
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:49,398
deal of

874
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,918
Separation um with highly significant

875
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:54,000
results and higher R squar

876
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,440
values and so for me this was very

877
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,038
exciting and and looking at yes we can

878
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,080
uh try and manipulate the

879
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,679
microbiome through these Technologies

880
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,158
which is great

881
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,039
and I'm really glad I did those studies

882
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,679
and then it's also important to look at

883
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:14,759
okay there's a lot of variation even

884
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,878
within a single tree here of uh of of

885
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,440
where these these microbes are based on

886
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,480
uh presumably dispersal because any

887
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,320
physiological differences we tend to

888
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,039
find don't have uh big impacts on the

889
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,039
microbiome um and with our diversity we

890
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,279
find that

891
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,599
again it's a little complicated

892
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,399
and and messy but it uh but but the

893
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,320
brown lines for the lower canopy do tend

894
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,440
to be the highest in fungi overall and

895
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,119
then when we do the stats for the

896
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,240
overall trend it comes across as very

897
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,079
highly significant that the um lower

898
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,918
canopy consistently has the highest

899
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,320
diversity and then we see the same thing

900
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:56,918
for bacteria as well

901
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,880
um so this this uh I I make another note

902
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,679
on this the this uh confirms our

903
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,480
hypothesis about the island biogeography

904
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,960
theory that and at least acts in the way

905
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,838
that we would expect if

906
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,320
soil is the main source of uh microbes

907
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:14,199
and they are being dispersed from the

908
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,480
soil to the above ground apples as

909
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:18,319
if in the same way that like birds fly

910
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,519
from the mainlands to to

911
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,800
Islands um and

912
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,599
then we uh did uncover some potential

913
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,400
compositional differences as well

914
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,559
previously I mentioned for one of my

915
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,119
other studies we did kind this whole big

916
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:33,838
metagenome sing with shotgun

917
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,119
metagenomics what we did here is a

918
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:39,078
little different um because we didn't

919
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,960
have the the money to do full shock

920
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,680
metomic sequencing so used a tool that

921
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,320
predicts the metagenomes based on on

922
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:50,199
what bacteria there are are called py

923
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,599
crust um and the main result I got from

924
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,399
this that while you have to be a bit

925
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,838
more careful with P data because you're

926
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,920
not working with the actual metagenome

927
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,639
you're just working with what you think

928
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,440
the metag genome should be based on what

929
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:04,598
bacteria there are um that we see that

930
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:09,639
over half of the

931
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,280
um of of uh the genes or Kos these like

932
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,118
small genetic elements that we're not

933
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,839
technically sure if they're genes um

934
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,480
involved in uh secondary metabolite

935
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:21,960
biosynthesis so all these exra compounds

936
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,119
that could potentially be uh toxic to

937
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,880
other microbes but can serve of a

938
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,200
variety of purposes that over half of

939
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,800
them are increased in abundance in the

940
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,919
lower canopy and and to me my

941
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,200
interpretation of this was not

942
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,720
necessarily that all these microbes are

943
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,239
producing a ton of secondary metabolites

944
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:38,799
but just that there's a greater

945
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,039
diversity of of microbes a greater

946
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,920
diversity of

947
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,559
metabolism that that you see that this

948
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,838
is a more complicated a community that's

949
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,960
ends up

950
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,400
producing more compounds because of

951
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,519
that right so when we zoom out a bit and

952
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,519
look at the broader implications here um

953
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:00,280
so we think that most likely this comes

954
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,480
from a dispersal soil because of the

955
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,880
diversity uh patterns we see and the big

956
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,960
compositional differences that that is

957
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,720
most likely due to some sort of

958
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,400
dispersal and it matches what we would

959
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,799
expect from VI biogeography theory if

960
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,559
the source is the soil and microbes are

961
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,680
being dispersed to um above ground

962
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,119
apples and we also know that uh in

963
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:21,960
controlled environment experiments with

964
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,000
a rabid opsis this has been done and

965
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,119
it's been shown that yes like most

966
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,358
microbes from the soil

967
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,720
can uh

968
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:34,159
can colonize the uh the above ground

969
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,879
phosphere and when when you do that the

970
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,759
above ground phosphere it looks pretty

971
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,079
similar to uh what it would be outside

972
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,319
of a controlled environment uh so it

973
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,880
really does look like when you're

974
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:46,679
looking at these above ground uh uh

975
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,960
microbiomes dispersal from soil uh that

976
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:52,480
is my belief anyway is is this important

977
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,079
factor um and having more dispersal from

978
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,119
soil and the lower canopy it's a bit of

979
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,240
a mixed bag that The microbiome go study

980
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,079
microbiomes people like to take

981
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,279
the sort of positive look at it of like

982
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,519
yeah the microbes are here like

983
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,920
protecting the

984
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:12,960
apples uh protecting the fruit but the

985
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,119
these um microbes could also have a

986
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,838
greater risk for uh post haris pathogens

987
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,440
colonizing because of that uh greater

988
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:23,440
dispersal and again uh my main takeaway

989
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,480
is that when we look at uh which I guess

990
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,119
we'll see in these

991
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,559
conclusions the the the spa should uh to

992
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,800
temporal factors and this kind of

993
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,759
fundamental C ecology concepts are very

994
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,560
important for studying uh these

995
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,880
microbiomes that we can

996
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,400
manipulate uh with our our Technologies

997
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,800
and get some differences uh but what

998
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,838
really shapes the microbiome what's

999
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,760
there and what we can work with are

1000
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,519
these fundamental spao temporal factors

1001
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,720
right so overall yeah have our different

1002
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,239
canopy areas have uh distinct

1003
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:58,118
microbiomes the lower canopy has the

1004
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,639
highest diversity

1005
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,039
which we are suspecting is due to this

1006
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,719
increased dispersal in accordance with

1007
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,119
Island biogeography Theory and we found

1008
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,159
some functional differences and then a

1009
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,519
part

1010
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,000
that I think is important too is that

1011
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,719
like I said we see huge differences in

1012
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,760
the communities between years but the

1013
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,879
patterns the fact that we see

1014
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,480
differences between these canopy areas

1015
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,318
are the same and that the uh different

1016
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,880
uh gener that

1017
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:26,960
are uh different in the lower canopy

1018
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,160
versus the upper canopies I I didn't

1019
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,838
show all all these data but it it

1020
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,960
remains prettyy consistent between the

1021
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:36,960
two years uh that we looked at so it to

1022
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,079
me it feels like this is really a a

1023
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,079
fundamentally important force uh shaping

1024
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,760
the

1025
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,800
microbiome right so okay zooming even

1026
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,520
further out to look at kind of what I've

1027
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,760
accomplished in my PhD in two minutes um

1028
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:55,759
that we found that uh ethline mediated

1029
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,800
fruit maturity so either by applying an

1030
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,079
uh an eth inhibitor or just harvesting

1031
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,599
early uh is linked to microbiome

1032
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,560
compositions and we found this in

1033
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,559
Snapdragon which has pronounced climac

1034
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,119
which we found results there than Ang

1035
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:09,480
Gala which doesn't so that could

1036
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,640
potentially be an important C ofir

1037
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,039
effect as well um the skull inhibitor

1038
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:18,078
DPA has a very notable effect on fungi

1039
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,599
um and the fungi sides have a little to

1040
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,519
no effect um which was kind of

1041
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:24,359
surprising but is consistent with the

1042
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,159
literature and looking at that I looked

1043
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,759
at the spao temporal effects which I

1044
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,078
found seem to be really important in

1045
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,119
shaping the

1046
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:33,720
microbiome um with these Dynamics

1047
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,119
matching some of what we would expect

1048
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,358
based on classical ecology Theory like

1049
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,318
uh the theory of Island

1050
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:43,480
biogeography all right and a lot of

1051
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:44,880
people helped me through uh a lot of

1052
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,039
this work a lot of people who are here

1053
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,800
in this room and a lot of people who

1054
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:50,838
have since moved on to uh bigger and

1055
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,560
better things so I just wanted to say uh

1056
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:54,719
thank thanks to everyone who helps me

1057
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,078
out with this work um and I'm happy to

1058
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,078
take any questions

1059
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,079
Conor can you describe the uh the trees

1060
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,839
that you were sampling from and how you

1061
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,839
how you sampled and then also um whether

1062
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,318
or not the Orchards that you were

1063
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:17,119
sampling from were applied with any

1064
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:20,759
fungicides or

1065
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,680
maides all right so let

1066
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,839
me go back so

1067
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,719
um Mo the uh right for Zoom the question

1068
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:30,679
was uh can I

1069
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,199
describe basically what what the trees

1070
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,879
look like how we sampled and how how

1071
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:36,519
they're

1072
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,640
treated um so this is specifically the

1073
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,239
tree that we used for the um a set of

1074
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:43,759
trees we used for this last experiment

1075
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:47,078
on the different canopy

1076
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,680
areas uh most of the trees that we

1077
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:52,160
used look fairly similar with the second

1078
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,519
experiment on funder sdes the the Fuji

1079
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,480
the trees were a bit

1080
00:41:53,519 --> 00:42:00,119
larger um that it's this as most Apple

1081
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,159
people probably know these more modern

1082
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:07,440
kind of like smaller trees that are uh

1083
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:10,318
easier to uh get to and the way I

1084
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,440
sampled was because uh even back when I

1085
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:15,119
was thinking about

1086
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,559
um

1087
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,400
uh even back in the earlier

1088
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:21,039
experiments and when I wasn't directly

1089
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,079
looking at the different canopy areas I

1090
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,279
I was thinking and uh ysf who's in the

1091
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,760
audience like even made a comment to me

1092
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,040
about like oh you might not want to take

1093
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,440
the apples that are like super low to

1094
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,480
the ground because like those might just

1095
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,079
like have more like dirt on them you

1096
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,400
might get like a different microbiome

1097
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,039
which um was one of the things that got

1098
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,039
me thinking about this question actually

1099
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:44,639
um that I tried to make sure that

1100
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,000
um that I was pulling um each sample is

1101
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,558
like a few different apples like four or

1102
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,079
five and I was trying to pull them from

1103
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:55,040
different areas on the same tree ideally

1104
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,920
so um If This Were The Experiment I so

1105
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,480
so so a sample would be like I would

1106
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,519
take a few replicates um and each

1107
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,800
replicate would be like let's say four

1108
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:05,280
apples from here for the lower canopy

1109
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,599
like four apples kind of from here for

1110
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,760
the inner camp and four apples from here

1111
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:10,200
for the outer campy trying to get uh

1112
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,400
different areas as a result for some of

1113
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:16,279
my early experiments um I was uh it was

1114
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,200
pretty slowo uh Chris had the nickname

1115
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,920
Speedy Gonzalez for me while I was

1116
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:23,480
sampling because I would be very

1117
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,119
meticulous in trying to uh pick out

1118
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,400
different apples and uh it would take a

1119
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,880
while as a result and I would not have

1120
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,039
very many apples um did that fully

1121
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,240
answer your question how is that tree

1122
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,159
and like what's the canopy withd just

1123
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:40,239
trying to get a sense of like what the

1124
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:43,799
outer versus inner canopy is for yeah um

1125
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:49,039
so the tree is

1126
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,839
uh trying to about 10 feet tall yeah 10

1127
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,358
feet tall I was trying to convert it in

1128
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:54,199
into meters and I was like I probably

1129
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:58,279
don't need to do that

1130
00:43:54,199 --> 00:44:00,519
um yeah so we we had uh

1131
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,119
certain like guidelines for like what

1132
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:05,199
constituted like lower outer and inner

1133
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,838
canopy based on kind of rough distances

1134
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,358
the the lower canopy was about

1135
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,199
everything below kind of like waist

1136
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:12,719
waist height upper canopy was like

1137
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:16,000
everything above chest height and then

1138
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:19,159
outer an in in our canopy

1139
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,920
um we were able to

1140
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:24,318
uh to just by trying to pick the ones

1141
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,880
like really close and really uh far away

1142
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,119
from the center of the tree and then I'm

1143
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,119
also remembering the other part of the

1144
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,960
question you asked was about how they

1145
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,599
were treated um pretty much all these

1146
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,760
trees were treated with fungicides

1147
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,599
throughout the uh the growing season so

1148
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,000
that was like

1149
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,960
a what about have you thought about

1150
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,358
reflective Fabric and like how that

1151
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,838
could right your Harvest maybe there'll

1152
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:48,639
be less soil spray or something yep that

1153
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:52,440
is a great question so the question was

1154
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:55,000
what about a reflective fabric so um in

1155
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,599
case people don't know uh there will be

1156
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,880
like reflective like I don't know what's

1157
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,000
made out as like aluminum

1158
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,838
uh there'll be this like fabric put down

1159
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
um with the idea that if the sunlight

1160
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:08,799
hits Rays on the ground they'll bounce

1161
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,239
back up and hit the apples so because

1162
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,559
light is important for developing the

1163
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,279
color of the fruit that's why Growers

1164
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:18,040
will uh put down this reflective like

1165
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,400
shiny uh uh fabric Thing to get more red

1166
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,838
looking apples generally and the

1167
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,880
question was do we think that that would

1168
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:27,039
affect the microbiome by potentially uh

1169
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,800
reducing um the dispersal I think

1170
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,199
absolutely would would be my guess um

1171
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,559
that that would definitely be something

1172
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:33,879
I'd be interested in looking into as a

1173
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,839
followup from

1174
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,960
this uh going into a bit more depth of

1175
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,558
uh dispersal there are a couple ways

1176
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,559
that uh people have shown that dispersal

1177
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,599
from soil to the above ground can happen

1178
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:48,680
one is uh through the air there are some

1179
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,039
classical micro microbiological studies

1180
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,960
on it um interestingly there was one

1181
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,079
that found that it like mostly only

1182
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,519
occurred on like sunny days during the

1183
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,920
daytime was when this happened um

1184
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,440
I don't exactly know why but that was

1185
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,280
what they found and that I think that's

1186
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
a lot of what we're getting because

1187
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,119
we're looking at the outside of the

1188
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,440
fruit that the other way microbs can get

1189
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,280
into the apple is uh through the root

1190
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,679
system through the xylem that microbes I

1191
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,640
I didn't notice until I started looking

1192
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,440
into it actually but that a lot of

1193
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,799
microbes do go through the plant xylm in

1194
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,880
in into the above ground as well so that

1195
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,800
would probably not be affected by the

1196
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,318
reflective fabric as much but the aerial

1197
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,720
dispersal we get I'm seeing a lot of

1198
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:29,800
when I do the Apple wash probably would

1199
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:33,239
be effed would be my guess so out of

1200
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:37,240
time one question of those

1201
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:39,639
one yes that was a great talk thank you

1202
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:41,719
my question is maybe this is kind of

1203
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,558
alluded to with the light question too

1204
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:45,318
so what we consider and I'm not sure if

1205
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,200
you looked into this but it's sort of

1206
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:48,358
like the spatial element of the apple

1207
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,598
right so just looking at the single

1208
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:53,199
fruit um and given off of what you were

1209
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,240
saying based off of like the microbes

1210
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,480
being uh transferred to the Apple

1211
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:59,318
through the xylm are there differences

1212
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,400
between the kaix end and the other side

1213
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:04,679
of the fruit in terms of uh microbial

1214
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,280
diversity at all or you know like just

1215
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:10,000
uh know between the Sun and shaded side

1216
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,079
or something like that y so uh the

1217
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,480
question was what about differences like

1218
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,720
biographical differences like within the

1219
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,400
Apple itself like Kix end so the bottom

1220
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:22,759
and then the stem end the top or sun and

1221
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,440
shaded side um and so the answer is for

1222
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,200
kend absolutely there's

1223
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,960
um uh research group that's done a lot

1224
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:32,118
of work on different experiments and

1225
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,079
they find consistent differences between

1226
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,318
stem and

1227
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,680
KX um and they find that the middle like

1228
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:39,759
like the peel middle tends to have the

1229
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:41,759
lowest diversity and the lowest

1230
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,280
microbial count because it's you might

1231
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,200
imagine it's like harder for a microbe

1232
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,839
to survive there but in the KX end and

1233
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,879
in the sem end where there are those

1234
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:51,920
kind of grooves for the microbes s in

1235
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,160
they tend to find higher diversity and

1236
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,960
uh

1237
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:58,039
higher uh High higher uh microbial

1238
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,440
counts

1239
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:04,519
um sun and shaded side we're not

1240
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,720
uh totally sure funny story about that

1241
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:07,039
though there was actually like a little

1242
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:08,759
miscommunication in this project where

1243
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,119
that was what Chris originally wanted me

1244
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,000
to test with this

1245
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,000
study um but but when he was looking

1246
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,119
at and then I took it more in a

1247
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,559
direction of um outer versus inner

1248
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,240
canopy because uh when I do the Apple

1249
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,599
wash you get the entire Apple so you're

1250
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:30,399
not able to look at Sun version shaded

1251
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,119
they are um methods that can be used for

1252
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,440
that the other group that I talked about

1253
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:37,720
that

1254
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,480
um does the uh KX versus stemon what

1255
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:42,078
they do is they'll kind of take a bit of

1256
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,960
fruit flesh from the peel stem and KX uh

1257
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,559
they'll uh grind it up in in liquid

1258
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,039
nitrogen and and just do the DNA

1259
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,079
extraction from there so it's like it's

1260
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,159
mostly Apple DNA but they get enough

1261
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,519
microbes and then when they amplify a

1262
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:55,879
small region of of bacterial or fungal

1263
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,719
DNA they get enough bacterial or fungal

1264
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,358
DNA uh to get some microbiome sequencing

1265
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:04,598
and I did actually try those methods

1266
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:06,000
very early on in my PhD um and part of

1267
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,000
the

1268
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,920
uh um and it didn't end up working for a

1269
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,119
few reasons part of that being that like

1270
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,318
it requires a lot more samples and a lot

1271
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:17,480
more sequencing money and part of it

1272
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,759
being the sequencing just didn't work as

1273
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,960
well and I asked them about it over

1274
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,079
email and they're like oh yeah like we

1275
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,119
have this like fancy $20,000 like

1276
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,200
homogenizer equipment thing I forget

1277
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:27,838
exactly what it was I'm like well I

1278
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:31,039
don't think I can get that so I'm going

1279
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,920
to find a different way um and that was

1280
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,759
part of the empis for why I developed

1281
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,639
Apple wash solution but it also gives

1282
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,799
higher quality DNA just in general so I

1283
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,558
didn't just do it because it was easier

1284
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:44,079
and I didn't have the money there were

1285
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:48,798
scientific reasons but all sort of

1286
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,798
positive not finish off thank you very

1287
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,280
much this has been a production of

1288
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,280
