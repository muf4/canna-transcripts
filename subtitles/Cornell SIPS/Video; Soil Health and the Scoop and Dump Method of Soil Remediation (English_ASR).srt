00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,520
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,519
university

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,599
good day everybody hello my name is

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,039
miles schwartzak

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
i'm a graduate student here at the

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,559
department of horticulture i work with

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,320
the urban horticultural institute and

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,399
i'm going to talk to you today

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,160
about a couple things first i'm going to

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,719
talk about the the concept of soil

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
health

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,640
and how this is a an important way that

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
we're starting to think about soils

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
in this day and age and i'm also going

15
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,639
to talk about some of the research that

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,679
i've been conducting while i've been

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
here at cornell

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,039
particularly pertaining to soil

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,439
remediation

20
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,079
using a technique we call the scoop and

21
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,079
dump method

22
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,519
so i'm going to start off here like i

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
said talking about soil health and when

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,239
we think about soil health what we're

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,760
thinking about

26
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,959
is the integration of multiple aspects

27
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,320
of soil science

28
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,558
and the three main areas that we're

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,840
talking about are the physical

30
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,759
the biological and the chemical

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,879
a lot of kind of traditionally in soil

32
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,960
testing

33
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,399
we've mostly focused on just the

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,239
chemical aspects

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,600
of soils which are very important

36
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,438
aspects

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,359
but there's kind of a bigger picture and

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,438
more to be told with the story

39
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,200
so the concept of soil health is is

40
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,239
finding the the most important

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
indicators

42
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,599
of your soil that are responsive to

43
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,839
management

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,599
so it can be changed by a practitioner

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,600
and also correlate well

46
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:30,158
with plant growth so here at cornell

47
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,559
we developed the soil health test out of

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,840
the crop and soil science department

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,400
and what this test does is it's a set of

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
standards

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
like i just described that when

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,359
integrated together

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,000
kind of gives you a holistic picture of

54
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,000
your soils

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,118
and this test is just like any other

56
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,078
soil test that you could

57
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,040
send a sample into and have results sent

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,959
back to you

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
but different from maybe strictly a

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,879
biological or chemical test

61
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:04,000
we cover a a bunch of different aspects

62
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,000
so when we talk about physical we're

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,118
mostly referring to is aggregate

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
stability

65
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:13,598
water holding capacity bulk density

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
texture and resistance or compaction

67
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,799
is a synonym when we're talking about

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
biological

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
mostly what we're thinking about is the

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,800
soil microorganisms now

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
this is going to cover organic matter

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,319
active carbon

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,760
which is just a fraction of total

74
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,079
organic matter

75
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:34,239
as well as soil respiration and protein

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
and also when we're looking at chemicals

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,080
we're going to be primarily looking at

78
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
ph and as well as our macro and

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,319
micronutrients

80
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,439
so as i go through this talk today i'm

81
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,159
going to introduce

82
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,560
these kind of concepts specifically and

83
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,079
then

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,598
when we talk about my results i'm going

85
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
to give a little more detail

86
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,318
about what these actually mean for the

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
practitioner

88
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,878
so when we're talking about soil health

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
we're talking about looking at specific

90
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,959
indicators

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,519
within specific

92
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,479
aspects of our soil so when we're

93
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
talking about the

94
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,518
physical aspects we're mainly talking

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
about aggregates

96
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,920
so the actual particles that

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
conglomerate together in your soils

98
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,639
and so size and distribution as well as

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,959
stability how easy they break apart

100
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,318
we're talking about porosity how easy

101
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
how much air is in your soil and how

102
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,399
much space is between your aggregates

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
and your

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,158
in your structure we're talking about

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
bulk density

106
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,079
which specifically refers to weight by

107
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,759
volume

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
and is a very good indicator for

109
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,798
compaction which can oftentimes be

110
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,280
a large inhibiting factor in

111
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
our soils or at least our abilities to

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
be able to

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,759
grow landscape plants directly in them

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
resistance as well which is a measure

115
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,518
another measure of compaction

116
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,199
which we can use a penetrometer a very

117
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
easy field tool to use

118
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,359
to get a a quick sense of what our

119
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,518
compaction looks like

120
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
and as well as water holding capacity

121
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
how much water is in the soil that is

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,438
available for your plants

123
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:11,199
and water infiltratability so how

124
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,199
quickly water can move into your soil

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
when we move on to the soil biological

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,079
factors mostly what we're talking about

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,799
is the microorganisms that we find in

128
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
our soil

129
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,799
and these play very a very important

130
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
role and have been an area of research

131
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
that has been gaining

132
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,279
more traction and more focus in recent

133
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
history

134
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,359
but a lot of what the biological factors

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
tend to focus on

136
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,639
is the ability for microorganisms to

137
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
mediate

138
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,280
soil nutrients turning over in the soil

139
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
as well as contribute them contributing

140
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,279
to

141
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
organic matter also the fixation of

142
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,239
nitrogen

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,519
is a common benefit we see from soil

144
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
biological

145
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,279
factors as well as detoxification of

146
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
pollutants

147
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,679
and the maintenance of soil structure

148
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
and as we're kind of thinking about soil

149
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,319
biology

150
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,000
uh the kind of mantra that i like to go

151
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,680
with or that you tend to hear frequently

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,360
is that what we're thinking about uh

153
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
specifically with nutrients

154
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
is feeding the soil uh not necessarily

155
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,279
feeding the plants specifically

156
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,120
and we'll get into this a little bit

157
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,599
more as we continue our talk today

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
and then the third major area is soil

159
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,039
chemical

160
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,839
and soil chemical refers uh to the

161
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,519
specific

162
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,119
micro and macro nutrients that are

163
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,519
required for plants to be able to grow

164
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,879
and

165
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,120
thrive in a given environment as well as

166
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,478
the specific ph which is also going to

167
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,439
be a limiting factor for what kind of

168
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,359
plants you can

169
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,560
use in that soil and then cation

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
exchange capacity

171
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
which specifically refers to the ability

172
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,600
for soil to hold on

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
to nutrients and then allow them to be

174
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,400
plant available

175
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,079
so that was a quick summary of what soil

176
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,519
health is and the general concepts that

177
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,079
go with it

178
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,439
and i'm going to move now into talking a

179
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,959
little bit about urban soils and

180
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,079
remediation

181
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,599
and if you're unfamiliar with the

182
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,719
concept of urban soils what we're

183
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
talking about when we're talking about

184
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,000
urban soils

185
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:06,079
are soils that are are non-agricultural

186
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,918
not necessarily naturally forming or not

187
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,399
naturally forming

188
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,279
and in one way or another are influenced

189
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,318
by

190
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,359
human impacts and development

191
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,720
so um

192
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
a definition that i like to use is

193
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,919
non-agricultural

194
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,758
man-made surface layer more than 50

195
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,000
centimeters thick

196
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,879
that has been produced by a mixing

197
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
filling

198
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,519
or contamination of land service in

199
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,960
urban and suburban areas

200
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,799
so when we talk about urban soils what

201
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,638
this can really refer to

202
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,478
is it could refer to parks it could

203
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,439
refer to botanic gardens it could refer

204
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,639
to

205
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,600
right of ways on highways

206
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,519
could be talking about urban like city

207
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,759
cores or even suburban

208
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,799
just like people's yards so soils that

209
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,199
are in one way or another

210
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,199
are influenced by human activity

211
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,160
and the reason why we define urban soils

212
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,519
in the first place

213
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
is because there's a number of set

214
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,439
characteristics that we tend to find

215
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,880
in our urban soil systems and these

216
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,639
characteristics typically

217
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,319
tend to have adverse effects on the

218
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
landscape plants that we wish to put in

219
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
those landscapes

220
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
so what we tend to find in an urban

221
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,198
system is high soil bulk density

222
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
decreases in organic matter poor

223
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,400
structure

224
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,440
high ph low water holding capacity

225
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,560
a decrease in aggregate stability

226
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,199
inadequate depth for for roots to be

227
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,918
able to

228
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,240
proliferate in the soil and as well as a

229
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,000
decrease in microbial biomass

230
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,598
and activity

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
so here at cornell we were trying to

232
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,560
think of ways of of how to kind of

233
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
uh proactively deal with with urban

234
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,839
soils and some of the challenges that we

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,399
tend to see with them

236
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,038
so uh in the urban horticultural

237
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,279
institute

238
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,560
in unibastic's lab we focused on

239
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,719
developing this technique

240
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
known as the scoop and dump technique of

241
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,400
soil remediation

242
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
and the practices is relatively

243
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,679
straightforward

244
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,038
what you do is you come in with compost

245
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,598
into a compacted

246
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,680
and disturbed urban soil site and you

247
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,560
apply that compost at a rate of six to

248
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,598
eight inches

249
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,839
on the top of the soil surface and then

250
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,759
you come in with either a backhoe

251
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,079
or mini excavator or you can even do it

252
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,800
with shovels and what you do is you you

253
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,359
physically use your backhoe to fracture

254
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
and

255
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
scoop down to the soil reaching into the

256
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,278
subsoil

257
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,718
you lift it up that soil shake it and

258
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,080
drop it

259
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,479
and what this does is it creates a

260
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
heterogeneous mixture of compost and

261
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
soil

262
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,039
and after that point you can either

263
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
rototill it or just iron rake it over to

264
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,480
create a smooth

265
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,039
planting surface and then you apply

266
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,920
mulch and what you have after this

267
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,039
at this point is a planting bed that is

268
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,639
now

269
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,278
you can directly put plants into

270
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,799
mostly we've used this with shrubs and

271
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,240
tree species

272
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,599
and this is just a few pictures of what

273
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,959
it kind of looks like you can you do

274
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
this technique either by

275
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,958
using a backhoe or by using if you have

276
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,879
a lot of

277
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,159
help you can do it by shovels but it's

278
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,080
accessible and you can use it to either

279
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,278
create large planting beds or very small

280
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
planting beds if you want to just put

281
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:26,159
one tree in or just a few shrubs

282
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,159
or if you want to renovate a large area

283
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,199
and on the cornell campus we've been

284
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,519
doing the scoop and dump practice for

285
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,399
the last 14 years now as a part of

286
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,679
neenah basics

287
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,320
creating the urban eden woody plant id

288
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,879
and landscape establishment class every

289
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,879
year

290
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,320
the class will create a new garden on

291
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,399
campus

292
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
and when they design this garden and

293
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,278
then eventually install it they've been

294
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,799
using the scoop and damp

295
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,039
technique and we've used this technique

296
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,719
in

297
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,439
in a various number of places this is a

298
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,320
picture of outside of a mann library

299
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
when we were doing construction a few

300
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,640
years ago

301
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,879
and you can see that the the landing

302
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,000
area right in front of the building

303
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,000
here's another angle of that of what a

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,919
construction landscape looked like and

305
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,799
this is what the landscape looks like

306
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,240
today where we've come in we've used the

307
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,199
scoop and dump technique

308
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
to remediate the soil and now it is a a

309
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
place where it went from highly

310
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
compacted

311
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,399
and impacted from construction to a

312
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,679
place where having our landscape plants

313
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,879
thrive and survive

314
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,799
so we wanted to kind of look at the

315
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,679
scoop and dump technique and learn a few

316
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,319
things about it

317
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,199
we wanted to find how changes in soil

318
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,040
quality

319
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
based on soil health had changed in

320
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,078
response to doing the scoop and dump

321
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,600
technique

322
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,599
and we also wanted to look at this to

323
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
see how since we had 12 years worth of

324
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,320
gardens or 14 years at this point

325
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,120
we were able to see over time also how

326
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,120
changes were made

327
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,958
so we selected three sites

328
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,000
where this technique had been applied

329
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,879
and three sites directly adjacent to it

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,519
this way we could do a control type

331
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,120
experiment where we had plants growing

332
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
or so we had soils that had been

333
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,039
developed by the scoop and dump

334
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,519
technique

335
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,240
and then we had areas that were close by

336
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,320
that had

337
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
received similar impacts but

338
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
had not gone through the same

339
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,919
remediation

340
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,600
so we went to these sites and we took

341
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,879
soil cores

342
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,278
we took three of them they were about

343
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,360
this size and we took these cores and we

344
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,039
extracted samples directly from our

345
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,240
scoop and dump soils and then at equal

346
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,078
depth we also took them

347
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
in our unamended and we went just below

348
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,719
our mulch level because as i mentioned

349
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
when you do the scoop and dump technique

350
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,000
you add mulch every year as you would in

351
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,278
any kind of

352
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,679
landscape bed establishment and we

353
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,759
selected our unamended or control soils

354
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,638
at the same depth as we found our scoop

355
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,519
and dump soils so i'm going to go

356
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,519
through the results

357
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,799
that we found of our study and as i

358
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,839
discussed these i'm also going to

359
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,000
discuss

360
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
some of the soil quality indicators and

361
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
what they mean

362
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,120
so we get a sense of not just what

363
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,600
happened but giving a broader picture of

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
soil health

365
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
so the first thing i'm going to talk

366
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,000
about is aggregate stability

367
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,000
and what we're talking about when we're

368
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,039
referring to aggregate stability

369
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
is essentially the soil aggregates these

370
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,439
large particles

371
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
that have conglomerated together and

372
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
their ability

373
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,559
to resist destruction and the

374
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,879
destruction of forces that we apply on

375
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,719
them

376
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,240
or water there's two ways you can look

377
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,399
at this you can either look at this by

378
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320
flooding how much the aggregates break

379
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,879
apart when inundated with water

380
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,839
or you can look at it as we do in the

381
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,439
soil health lab

382
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:49,360
using a rain infiltrometer here which

383
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,839
simulates a very heavy rainstorm event

384
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,919
and essentially the the more stable your

385
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,279
aggregates the less they break apart

386
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,360
the better that is for your soil

387
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,919
structure and

388
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,519
just generally uh creating a kind of

389
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,120
more agreeable environments for

390
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,799
our plant to put our plants directly

391
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
into

392
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,240
so when we looked at the scoop and dump

393
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,919
versus our controlled soils what we

394
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,480
found is that

395
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:16,639
our scuba dump soils had uh 72

396
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,839
aggregate stability and if you compare

397
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,720
this to our unamended

398
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,480
we see that our unamended is at about 34

399
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,560
and so just by doing the scoop and dump

400
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
technique coming in and incorporating

401
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,919
organic matter and physically fracturing

402
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,919
the soil

403
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,278
and mulching over their site we saw that

404
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,799
we had almost double

405
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,799
the amount of aggregate stability

406
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,198
next we have organic matter and what

407
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,239
we're talking about when we're talking

408
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,039
about organic matter

409
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,560
is it's primarily carbon that is derived

410
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,240
from a living source

411
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,039
so whether this be plant or animal

412
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,278
residues or microorganisms that we're

413
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,958
finding in the in the soil

414
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,399
it's a little more involved than that

415
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,078
but as a basic sense that's we're

416
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
referring to and organic matter is a

417
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,000
very important component of our soils

418
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,679
i think most people kind of know that

419
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,958
the it tends to be the more organic

420
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,039
matter you have in the soils

421
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,198
uh it it improves structure and it

422
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,759
certainly is beneficial for

423
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,078
cation exchange capacity therefore the

424
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,240
ability for soil to hold on to nutrients

425
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,439
so in a functioning ecosystem where we

426
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,519
want our plants to

427
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,079
thrive and survive organic matter is a

428
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,919
very important indicator to look at

429
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,838
and on average when we look across these

430
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,719
sites what we see is that our scoop and

431
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,320
dump soils

432
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,278
we have 8.43 organic matter compared to

433
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
our unamended

434
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,639
that is at 3.23

435
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
so almost three times the organic matter

436
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
after doing this incorporation

437
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,198
which makes sense since we're adding

438
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
compost we're adding a lot of organic

439
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,838
matter

440
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,838
but it's good to see this

441
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,159
next there's active carbon and this is

442
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,319
kind of a

443
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,519
newer test that some people may not be

444
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
as familiar with

445
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,198
but what we're talking about when we

446
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,839
talk about active carbon is essentially

447
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,319
it's uh

448
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,800
the fraction of your organic matter that

449
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,440
is available for soil microorganisms

450
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,278
to consume and to use as a food source

451
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,240
so active carbon is a biological

452
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,278
indicator

453
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
and it really is

454
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,198
a little different than our total

455
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,519
organic matter because that refers to

456
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,198
all of the all of the organic matter we

457
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,759
find active carbon is just a fraction of

458
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,439
it

459
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,679
and is this food source for our soil

460
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
microorganisms which play mediating

461
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,759
roles

462
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,920
in our nutrient turnovers and what

463
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,879
we see when we looked at active carbon

464
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,198
is that

465
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:37,919
our active carbon we are up around

466
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,958
1022 parts per million compare this to

467
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,039
our unamended

468
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:45,198
at 361 and so almost

469
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,958
we have more than three times the amount

470
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,359
of active carbon in our scoop and dump

471
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,359
soils

472
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,159
moving over to water holding capacity

473
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
water holding capacity specifically

474
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,439
refers to the amount of water that is

475
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,599
being held

476
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
in your soil that is available to plants

477
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,720
so on one end of the extreme

478
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,359
you have field capacity which is the

479
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,360
amount of water that's held in the soil

480
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,120
when you've had a large rain event and

481
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
just due to gravity alone the water is

482
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,078
drained out of it the amount of water

483
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
that is held in the soil

484
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,519
after that draining event is known as

485
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,519
field capacity

486
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,639
and on the other end of the spectrum you

487
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
have what's known as

488
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,639
permanent wilting point and permanent

489
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,879
wilting point refers to the point

490
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,320
where the amount of water in the soil is

491
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,078
no longer available to plants

492
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
so plants cannot pull it up from their

493
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,519
roots

494
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,519
and therefore the plant will start to

495
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,600
have a drought response at this point so

496
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,399
water holding capacity is between

497
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
these two extremes so this is very

498
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
important as you'd imagine

499
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
for thinking about irrigation and also

500
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,759
thinking about

501
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,040
just general maintenance of plants in

502
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,320
the landscape

503
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,719
and what we see with available water

504
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,920
holding capacity is that

505
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,959
in our scoop and dump we ended up with

506
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,479
0.23

507
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,399
well you compare this to our unamended

508
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,640
which is 0.15

509
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,199
and these differences may not look as

510
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,120
large as some of our other indicators

511
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,759
but statistically this is quite

512
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,798
significant and we see that our our

513
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,199
scuba dump soils do hold significantly

514
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,720
more

515
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,279
water so the next indicator i'm going to

516
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,838
talk about

517
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,639
is potentially mineralizable nitrogen

518
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,159
and

519
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,799
what this indicator refers to

520
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,240
specifically is the conversion

521
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,558
of nitrogen for an organic form

522
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,839
into an inorganic form so going from

523
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,960
plant unavailable

524
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,798
to plant available and what i put have

525
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
up here on picture of this slide is the

526
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,960
full

527
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
nitrogen cycle and i'm not going to go

528
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
into full detail about this

529
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,360
but this is just kind of one one

530
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,879
component of it potentially

531
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,479
mineralizable nitrogen is another

532
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
biological indicator since this is

533
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,279
mediated by soil microorganisms

534
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,319
and also since nitrogen is such an

535
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,519
important

536
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,678
element for or nutrient for

537
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,440
plants to use an important one to look

538
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
at and when we looked at potentially

539
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
mineralizable nitrogen

540
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,960
in our scoop and dump compared to our

541
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,319
unamended soils what we found

542
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,600
is that we had almost 10 times the

543
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,558
amount of potentially immoralizable

544
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,879
nitrogen

545
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,759
compared to or unamended so 27.53 parts

546
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,919
per million compared to

547
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,839
3.11 in our unamended

548
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,080
next we looked at resistance using a

549
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,359
pentrometer

550
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,759
pentrometer for people who aren't

551
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,079
familiar with it is

552
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,240
is this instrument right here it's

553
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,918
pretty straightforward it has a

554
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,919
pressure gauge on one side and a

555
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,679
measuring bar in the middle

556
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,200
and what you do is you take this and you

557
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,080
can push it into your soil

558
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
at a consistent rate and measure at what

559
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,199
point

560
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,320
your soils reach a pressure of 300

561
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,919
psi or higher and the significance of

562
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,159
300 psi

563
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,038
is that that is the kind of point in

564
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
your soils

565
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:05,279
where roots can no longer proliferate

566
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,440
in a compacted soil so you know if

567
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,119
you're below that threshold

568
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
that your roots are going to grow fine

569
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,159
if you're above it then you're going to

570
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,079
you have a compaction issue and you need

571
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,679
to address it one way or another

572
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,839
there are some limitations to using this

573
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,160
instrument it's best to use it directly

574
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,038
a short time after it rains especially

575
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,558
if you're going to be doing a lot of

576
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,359
different sites because soil moisture

577
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,599
can make

578
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,079
a difference in how you read it but it's

579
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,759
a great way to just get a quick estimate

580
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,439
of what the compaction looks like in

581
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,000
your soil and why we talk about it in

582
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,320
terms of soil health

583
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,400
and so when we looked at our scoop and

584
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,319
dump compared to our unamended what we

585
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
found is that in our scoop and dump we

586
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,279
could go down to 9.74 inches

587
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,079
before reading reaching our root

588
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,599
limiting

589
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,678
psi compared to our unamended which was

590
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,719
at 3.44 inches

591
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,440
so we had three times the rooting volume

592
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,440
or depth available to us that plants

593
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,038
could therefore

594
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,038
grow explore and use

595
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,720
next we looked at bulk density and as i

596
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,798
i

597
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,240
discussed before what bulk density is is

598
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,839
a measure

599
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,798
of weight by volume and this is another

600
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,918
indicator that's important to consider

601
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,679
when looking specifically at compaction

602
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,480
it is a little bit more telling

603
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
than using the resistance measure or the

604
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
pentrometer measure

605
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,880
and pretty straightforward to take but

606
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
we use these rings typically

607
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,000
to measure bulk density and

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,759
we'll hammer these into the soil get

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,359
them kind of flush so we know

610
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,679
how much volumes in here specifically

611
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,599
dry them out and then weigh that

612
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,360
and what we can tell the bulk density

613
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,000
just like we can tell with resistance

614
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,399
is that we know depending on texture

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
that

616
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,559
once you get above a specific bulk

617
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,679
density you start to

618
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:02,798
have trouble having roots grow

619
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,880
and proliferate in your soil so

620
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:10,240
in sands it's 1.75 grams per centimeter

621
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,760
cubed compared to silts and clay which

622
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,519
is around 1.4

623
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,119
and these numbers may not mean a lot

624
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,639
right now but as i discussed bulk

625
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,359
density several times throughout this

626
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
talk

627
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,279
there's going to be it's going to start

628
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,640
to make more sense

629
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,960
and so what we found in our scoop and

630
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,919
dump soils is that

631
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,720
we were at 0.89 grams per centimeter

632
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,600
cubed

633
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,120
which is well below that 1.4 threshold

634
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,158
so regardless of texture

635
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,079
we saw that by doing this process that

636
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,200
we were able to reduce our bulk density

637
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,240
and create a medium

638
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,798
where roots are going to have a much

639
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,599
easier time growing compare this to our

640
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,519
unamended

641
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:50,240
which is up at 1.47

642
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,918
and depending on texture you're kind of

643
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,519
just getting to that root

644
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,280
root limiting range so after we did our

645
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,798
first kind of study where we looked at

646
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,879
scuba dump soils in the compare and

647
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,200
contrast

648
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,799
setting we also wanted to look at how

649
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,919
did these soils change

650
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:11,200
over time so we selected

651
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,520
a cross section of 12 years

652
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,720
and we selected six sites out of those

653
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,119
that represented

654
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,600
that time frame and when we looked at

655
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,879
this in chrono sequence

656
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:27,599
what we found out is that over time our

657
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,600
bulk density decreased

658
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,959
we found that our potentially

659
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,038
mineralizable nitrogen

660
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
our nitrogen that is being converted

661
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,158
from in

662
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,840
organic to an inorganic form also

663
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:45,520
significantly increased over time

664
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,399
as well as our active carbon the portion

665
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,480
of our

666
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,000
of our total organic matter that is

667
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,440
available for micro

668
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,279
organisms to use as a food source

669
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
and it was really exciting to see this

670
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,639
because um when we did our first study

671
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,558
what we could see

672
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,799
is that yes by going in and doing the

673
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,200
scoop and dump practice we improved we

674
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,000
approved improved soil quality almost

675
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,360
immediately

676
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,038
and that was the first piece of data

677
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,839
what we saw when we looked at this over

678
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,558
time

679
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,240
is that by going in and doing this once

680
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,038
and then mulching every year

681
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,038
that there is an increased benefit that

682
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,599
keeps on

683
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,798
going after we've used this technique

684
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,399
active carbon

685
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,639
as well as potentially mineralizable

686
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,080
nitrogen are both biological indicators

687
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,919
so it gives us a good clue into what's

688
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,439
going on with the micro

689
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,038
the microbes in our soil and their

690
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
ability to

691
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,960
to mediate soil health and as well as

692
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,119
this bulk density which

693
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,880
continues to create an environment where

694
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,319
after we've established these plants

695
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
they're going to have a lot easier time

696
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:48,158
growing

697
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,919
so this is all very exciting to see and

698
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,440
what we wanted to do next was say all

699
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,360
right we've seen

700
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,960
that we've improved our soil quality and

701
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,639
that's a great thing but we also want to

702
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,480
see how plants respond

703
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,480
to these changes in soil quality

704
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,278
so we set up a soil container study

705
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,158
where we went out again to our scoop and

706
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,159
dump sites

707
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,480
and our in our unamended sites and we

708
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,159
took large cores pvc cores

709
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,798
that we hammered into the ground and

710
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,880
pulled out and

711
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,639
we were then able to take these soils

712
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
bring them into a growth chamber

713
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,840
and grow plants in them specifically to

714
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,278
see

715
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,119
how the plants responded to this

716
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,359
improved environment

717
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,119
and we were able to look at a number of

718
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,959
different factors

719
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,278
but first what we did when we took these

720
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,880
we used a ficus benjamina

721
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,319
which is known as a tropical street tree

722
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,159
we did this because we were running this

723
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,359
experiment in the winter but it is

724
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,880
oftentimes

725
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,798
a plant you do find in the urban

726
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,760
environment in

727
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,200
tropical and subtropical regions and so

728
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,960
the first things we looked at

729
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
after growing and establishing these

730
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,798
ficus benjamina

731
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,000
was how just what were the gross

732
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:02,720
plant growth response so we see

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
here that in our scoop and dump soils

734
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,038
compared to our unamended

735
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,120
vikings that were gone in there had

736
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,558
significantly more leaf area leaf area

737
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,359
was the first indicator that we looked

738
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,480
at

739
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,639
up at 933

740
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,360
centimeters squared compared to our

741
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,360
unamended which was at

742
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:24,240
578 centimeters squared

743
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,719
so significantly more leaf area was put

744
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
on

745
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,240
by the plants growing just in the scoop

746
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,679
and dump soil

747
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,240
when we destructively harvested and

748
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,320
extracted the roots and the shoots from

749
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,359
the plants what we found is that

750
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:42,319
we had significantly more dry weight of

751
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:45,038
roots for plants growing in our scoop

752
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,200
and dump soil compared to our unamended

753
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,480
and again these these differences do not

754
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,798
look

755
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,038
giant but statistically they are

756
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,000
significantly different

757
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,798
as well as the dry weights of shoots we

758
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,038
also had significantly more

759
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,400
shoot growth compared in our in our

760
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,720
scoop and dump soils compared to our

761
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,559
unamended

762
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
so again like in our last study we also

763
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,440
looked at bulk density

764
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
this measure of weight by volume and

765
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,798
what we found again

766
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,720
is that our scoop and dump soils are

767
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,720
were at this

768
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,079
0.97 range which is again

769
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,000
well below that 1.4 threshold compared

770
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,678
to our unamended soils which are up

771
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,798
in the 1.68 on average range

772
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,480
and we're starting to see limitations in

773
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,400
the soil based on that

774
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,079
so what we did is we did a linear

775
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,278
regression where we looked at

776
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:43,199
bulk density by our dry weight of shoots

777
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,480
so shoots referring to everything from

778
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,840
the soil line up

779
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,839
so leaves and any woody biomass

780
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,240
that was developed and what we see is a

781
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,959
very strong relationship here of

782
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,480
in the blue we have our scoop and dump

783
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,759
we have

784
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,599
more shoots on the axis here as well as

785
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,200
higher bulk densities so what we see is

786
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,839
a very clear relationship where we're

787
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,080
actually looking at

788
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,079
um the lower our bulk density is

789
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,240
correlating very strongly with

790
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,918
more dry weights of shoots and we can

791
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,798
see in our unamended soil

792
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,399
that this line right here is our 1.4

793
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:19,679
threshold we start seeing root limiting

794
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,319
bulk densities

795
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,960
they're all kind of clustered down and

796
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,918
when we look

797
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,399
at the dry weight of roots as well we

798
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,360
see

799
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,119
a very similar pattern of our reduced

800
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,759
bulk density correlating with

801
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:38,239
more root growth

802
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,759
as well as our leaf area we see the same

803
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,759
pattern yet again

804
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,679
where we have strong correlations with

805
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:48,398
reductions in bulk density

806
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,200
and increases in leaf area so when we

807
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,759
did this

808
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,519
uh destructive harvest after we had um

809
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,079
pulled the plants out of the soils

810
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,679
containers that they had been growing in

811
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,158
uh there was a few observations that

812
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,919
were

813
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,600
they were made that weren't so easy to

814
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,520
necessarily quantify and one of the big

815
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,158
things that we saw was just

816
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,000
was just where the roots were exploring

817
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,120
in these containers

818
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,558
and how much more you know

819
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,000
biomass they're putting on so this is a

820
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,519
pretty clear picture of our scoop and

821
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,759
dump roots you can see

822
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,119
a lot more a much larger root system

823
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,079
developing here compared to our

824
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,959
unamended

825
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,319
which is just not nearly not nearly as

826
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,159
dense

827
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,158
and what was interesting when we looked

828
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,480
specifically

829
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,278
at where the roots were in the container

830
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,558
is that

831
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:37,359
in our unamended soils

832
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,440
plants that were growing in our soils

833
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,278
that had not been remediated

834
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,759
that had this higher bulk density what

835
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,960
we would typically see is that

836
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,558
where we planted the ficus in the

837
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,840
container there would be roots that were

838
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,440
growing

839
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,798
right where we stuck the plug in and

840
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,399
then oftentimes what the roots would do

841
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,398
is they'd grow up from that plug

842
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,839
across the top of the container and then

843
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,798
down the sides

844
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,959
and so what the roots were actually

845
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,720
doing in this in this scenario was they

846
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,960
were not exploring the majority of the

847
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,798
soil volume in these unamended soils

848
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
but finding a way to kind of follow the

849
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,278
path of least resistance

850
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,839
and looking for an area where they could

851
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,640
grow

852
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,158
and escape so it's a very similar

853
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,440
pattern that you see here where you kind

854
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,640
of they came down

855
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,080
you kind of came down the middle where

856
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,000
you planted the plug and then they'd

857
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,240
escape off to the side

858
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,839
if you compare this to what we see in

859
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,278
our scoop and dump soils

860
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,759
the roots growing in our scoop and dump

861
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,960
soils had the ability to

862
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,158
really grow throughout the full amount

863
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,000
of the soil volume

864
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,320
they'd explore between those aggregates

865
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,119
and those different air space

866
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,599
and they the the volume they wouldn't do

867
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,359
the same

868
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,359
escaping pattern they would just grow

869
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,639
throughout the whole container

870
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,278
and even when you tried to break the

871
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,799
soils apart in your unamended soils

872
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,319
when you start to break the roots and

873
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,359
the soil apart the soil would just kind

874
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,839
of fall away

875
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,599
in our scoop and dump soils you'd be you

876
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:59,199
really have to work really hard to

877
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:02,959
to actually free the soil from the roots

878
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:07,200
to be able to get this so this was all

879
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,200
exciting to see and kind of in summary

880
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,000
i talked about early on that some of the

881
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,639
issues that we see in in urban soils

882
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,720
and characterization and by coming in

883
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,360
and doing the scoop and dump process

884
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,919
we've been able to improve the majority

885
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,079
of them

886
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,360
pretty much everything except for the

887
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,519
the high ph

888
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,479
so by doing the scoop and dump process

889
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,440
we are able to

890
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,360
decrease our bulk densities increase our

891
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,159
organic matter

892
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:37,678
improve our soil structure increase our

893
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,080
water holding capacity

894
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,240
increase our aggregate stability improve

895
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,759
our soil microorganism community

896
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,200
and as well as create

897
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,440
more soil volume for for plants to be

898
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,000
able to explore

899
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,558
so here are a few shots of locations

900
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,558
where

901
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:05,839
we have used this technique and what

902
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:05,839
some of the gardens look like today

903
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,119
okay so i'm going to take the last a

904
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,120
little bit of time in this talk

905
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,639
to talk about some of the the

906
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,798
practicalities of

907
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,080
implementing this technique and the

908
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,679
first thing i want to show

909
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,759
is just a cost estimate of some

910
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,840
of the parameters that we're looking at

911
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,398
if we want to actually implement this

912
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,240
the the main costs associated with the

913
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,278
scoop and dump technique are your

914
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,558
compost as well as getting

915
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,798
a backhoe machine in to use so

916
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,480
depending on where you work if you work

917
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,480
in a place that already has access

918
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,519
if you make your own compost this cost

919
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,519
can be eliminated

920
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,440
or decreased as well as if you work in a

921
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,159
place where you have access to the

922
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,919
referred to a machine then the rental

923
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,720
costs that i've projected here

924
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,600
are not going to be an issue as i

925
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,480
mentioned before

926
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,519
it is possible to do this technique also

927
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,558
just

928
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,240
with shovels and by hand but a very

929
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,798
important aspect of the scoop and dump

930
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,519
technique

931
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:12,000
is is doing the physical fracturing of

932
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,599
the soil

933
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,398
it's not simply adding compost

934
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,599
the compost with the mixing is what

935
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,639
creates this

936
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,678
soil mixture and that's where we find

937
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,200
the benefits here

938
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,440
so i just want to make that point kind

939
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,960
of clear so

940
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,278
estimates on an 100 square foot bed

941
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,278
depending if you want to go depending on

942
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,880
your depth of

943
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,119
compost you want to apply if we're

944
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
talking about about the six inch range

945
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,839
which would be

946
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,079
fairly typical that would take about

947
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:47,439
just under two yards of compost

948
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:50,240
um and i estimated

949
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,080
in this measurement for the bobcat mini

950
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,880
excavator to be rented for a three hour

951
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,079
period

952
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,159
so we're talking about for a hundred

953
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:59,439
square foot bed is about 212

954
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,519
dollars scale that up to 1 000 square

955
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,399
foot bed which would be a fairly large

956
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,240
size bed

957
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,398
but certainly something if you're

958
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,200
planning a large installation

959
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,599
is for the six inch depth you're looking

960
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,840
somewhere around

961
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,639
725 dollars again it's important to

962
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,599
think about

963
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,038
uh where your compost is coming from if

964
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,519
what kind of source and how expensive

965
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,839
you can

966
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,960
that is going to be as well as the

967
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,639
machine use

968
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,399
but the one kind of point when we do

969
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,679
think about costs that i want to

970
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,119
bring up is just the idea

971
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,200
that we know that this technique

972
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,678
improves your soils over the long

973
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
term so you have to think about it more

974
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,200
in terms of

975
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,159
making an initial investment and then

976
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,919
over time

977
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,960
it's going to continue to pay off and

978
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,720
this is going to be particularly

979
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,159
pronounced if you're working in a

980
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,839
at a site that has had plant failure in

981
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,240
the past

982
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,240
by using this technique you're going to

983
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,880
hopefully be able to decrease on plant

984
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,038
failure

985
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,480
and therefore be saving money by not

986
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:02,480
having to replace those plants

987
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,480
nearly so often or hopefully not at all

988
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,239
and when it does come to selecting

989
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:09,279
plants to be putting in this bed

990
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,838
what we talk about in the urban

991
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,480
horticultural institute is always

992
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,799
selecting your plants based on your

993
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,280
site's limitation

994
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,800
and the urban horticult the urban

995
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
horticultural institute

996
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,960
has a number of different resources

997
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,398
available to help you figure out what

998
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,760
your site limitations are

999
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,598
and i'm just going to talk about them

1000
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,679
kind of briefly here

1001
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,000
so the first one we oftentimes consider

1002
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,519
is to be cold hardiness

1003
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,679
and most people are familiar with this

1004
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,358
there's very good maps by the usda which

1005
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,800
will tell you what zone you're in

1006
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,398
and you always want to select your plant

1007
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,159
first on in

1008
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,519
based on zones so you know that it can

1009
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,679
thrive on the

1010
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,000
minimum temperature that you find in

1011
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,599
your area

1012
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,358
the next thing you consider is soil ph

1013
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,359
and you're either going to have

1014
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,519
you're going to have very you could have

1015
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,720
very acidic soils

1016
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,800
or very basic soils

1017
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,239
and based on this again there's not much

1018
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,359
we can do instead of select the right

1019
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,959
plants that are going to

1020
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,598
like that environment you can make

1021
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,720
changes to soil ph that is

1022
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,240
a possibility but oftentimes when we

1023
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,439
think about in the urban setting

1024
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,879
a cost that we do not tend to

1025
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
incur because we don't actually tend to

1026
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,640
change the soil's ph

1027
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,720
it's easier to select a plant that can

1028
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,920
deal with a kind of ph range or

1029
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:34,639
in instead of going out and buying a lot

1030
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,800
of amendments

1031
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,400
light is the next indicator you're going

1032
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,680
to have full sun which is

1033
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,200
six hours or more in a given day

1034
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,440
part shade which is going to be less

1035
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,559
than that or full shade which is maybe

1036
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,240
at most an hour of light in the day

1037
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,679
the next area that we consider is to be

1038
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,639
moisture which

1039
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,078
is how much water is going to be at your

1040
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,358
site so whether you have a site that

1041
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,119
frequently floods

1042
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,719
or frequently drains very fast and

1043
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,640
actually stays very kind of dry

1044
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,159
or if you're lucky enough to have

1045
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,118
something that can kind of do both it

1046
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,279
will

1047
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,440
infiltrate water quickly but also hold

1048
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,640
on to it

1049
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,760
and as well as salt exposure and this is

1050
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,920
something that we see particularly in a

1051
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,400
lot of institutional type settings or

1052
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,039
as well as on in transportation type

1053
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,480
areas we're either getting salt exposure

1054
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,400
from de-icing salts

1055
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,519
or salt soils if you're in a part of the

1056
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,119
country where

1057
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,119
salinity is an issue in your soils

1058
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880
so we have a great resource available to

1059
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,800
us

1060
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,200
here at cornell we've got the woody

1061
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,839
plant database

1062
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,319
and what's great about the woody plant

1063
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:51,358
database is you can go on to it

1064
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:54,160
and figure out your site's limitations

1065
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,000
plug those into our database and what

1066
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,879
will happen is it will generate a list

1067
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,239
of plants that are

1068
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,240
appropriate for your environment

1069
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,078
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

1070
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,598
some of these assessments most of these

1071
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,800
assessments of site limitation you can

1072
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,400
do on your own

1073
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,320
in a pretty straightforward kind of a

1074
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,079
way and then you can use the woody plant

1075
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,280
database to find plants that are going

1076
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,240
to be

1077
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,560
that are going to work for your

1078
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,039
landscape

1079
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,960
another resource available to people is

1080
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,000
the site assessment checklist

1081
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,838
and this uh comes from a book written by

1082
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,320
the urban horticultural institute

1083
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,039
which is recommended urban trees site

1084
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,760
assessment

1085
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,440
and tree selection for stress tolerance

1086
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,040
so similar to the um

1087
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,039
the database i was referring to a moment

1088
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,279
ago and in this book

1089
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,320
it's free and available on our website

1090
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,920
online

1091
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,760
but you can go through and they also

1092
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,119
have a checklist where you can actually

1093
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,480
go through each of your specific

1094
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,599
limitations

1095
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
and kind of check them off for a given

1096
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,680
site

1097
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,560
and then you can use that information to

1098
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,078
then select plants after that

1099
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,000
so as i mentioned before i've talked a

1100
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,519
lot about the concept of soil health

1101
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,400
what it is cornell has

1102
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,119
a soil health testing lab so you can

1103
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,320
actually

1104
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,760
take soils and collect them and send

1105
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,359
them into the lab and they can go

1106
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,599
through a battery of tests

1107
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,799
many of the ones i've talked about today

1108
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,160
as well as

1109
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,320
some other ones that i haven't focused

1110
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,920
on as much and

1111
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,200
for 85 dollars you can get a full

1112
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,480
package where you get a really good

1113
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,279
picture of what's going on

1114
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,800
and i would say that this is a great

1115
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,839
tool to use specifically

1116
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,200
if you're doing a new management

1117
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:32,480
technique on a piece of

1118
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,919
on a piece of land and you kind of want

1119
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,599
to see how your soils respond over

1120
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,000
change over time

1121
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,880
most soil testing it's always you always

1122
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,320
want to do it when

1123
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,838
before you're about to establish a new

1124
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
site or if you're trying to understand

1125
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,519
what's going on with a site specifically

1126
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,759
if you're having

1127
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,358
issues with with some of your plant

1128
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,400
failure

1129
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:51,519
or you're just trying to get a better

1130
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,960
sense but it's also something that's

1131
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,159
good to test over time

1132
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
and that's what's really convenient

1133
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,559
about the soil health test is that

1134
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,160
it is responsive to management so if you

1135
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,679
test one year

1136
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,358
maybe two or three years down the line

1137
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,799
you can test again and you can kind of

1138
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,880
see how your soils have changed in

1139
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,480
response to your management

1140
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,079
uh there's a few add-ons if you're

1141
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,119
concerned about heavy metals you can add

1142
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,000
that onto the test

1143
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,079
as well as soluble salts if that is

1144
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,639
another concern for you as well

1145
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
i would say if you don't want to go and

1146
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,480
get

1147
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,519
the full package for 85 you can also

1148
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,000
send in and get what we call

1149
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,800
a cart or specific tests done and i

1150
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,639
would say if you're going to get a

1151
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,400
minimum set of tests you should get

1152
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,000
your texture looked at you should get

1153
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,920
your organic matter looked at and you

1154
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,559
should get your ph looked at

1155
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,000
since these are all at least texture and

1156
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,400
ph is something that you're probably not

1157
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,960
going to be addressing

1158
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,240
in changing on your site but will be

1159
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,119
very informative

1160
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,559
when you want to select plants for that

1161
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,160
landscape

1162
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,000
and then there's actually a whole bunch

1163
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,000
of tests that you can do

1164
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,199
on your own the do-it-yourself

1165
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,079
assessments

1166
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,319
and these are bulk density resistance

1167
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,480
with a penetrometer

1168
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,079
ph and then some of the site limitations

1169
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,679
which i was discussing before

1170
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:14,160
so texture light hardiness

1171
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:15,679
salt exposure and moisture

1172
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,559
so i'm going to just talk about some

1173
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,919
doing some of these assessments yourself

1174
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,239
the first i'm going to talk about is

1175
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,599
specifically bulk density

1176
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,078
bulk density as i've mentioned many

1177
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,200
times is a measurement of

1178
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,200
weight by volume if you're doing

1179
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:34,639
a lot of soil testing it's wise to

1180
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,639
invest in a soil

1181
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,400
a can that you can use specifically to

1182
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,599
test these

1183
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,240
and it's a pretty straightforward

1184
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,318
process if you don't want to buy one of

1185
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,759
these you can also cut off two ends

1186
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,318
of a soup can anything that you know

1187
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,319
the specific size on or you can measure

1188
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,318
and figure out the specific side

1189
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,239
so what i want to show here briefly

1190
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,960
touch on is the actual technique of

1191
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,559
taking a bulk density measurement

1192
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,599
and it's a pretty straightforward

1193
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,358
process what you really need for it

1194
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,760
is just a few things you need a wood

1195
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:11,039
block you need a can

1196
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,920
and you need a hammer as well as an oven

1197
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,519
at home

1198
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,800
and a cookie sheet and

1199
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,199
this is a specific soil core that soil

1200
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,318
stamp

1201
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,480
people who are doing a lot of soil

1202
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,838
sampling will use

1203
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,358
if you don't want to purchase one of

1204
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,000
these you're only doing maybe one or two

1205
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,279
sites

1206
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,760
you can also use something like a soup

1207
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,119
can

1208
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,040
as well you of course want to be careful

1209
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
not to cut yourself but anything that

1210
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,480
you can measure

1211
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,159
the height and as well as the diameter

1212
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,760
so you can calculate the volume

1213
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,000
afterwards

1214
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,880
bulk density is a specific measurement

1215
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,119
of weight

1216
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,640
by volume and therefore tells us our

1217
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,240
compaction in our soil

1218
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,759
so the technique is pretty pretty

1219
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:53,519
straightforward we'll go

1220
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,040
out to a site and we'll if it's turfed

1221
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,199
what we'll do is we'll slice the turf

1222
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,719
layer off and then we'll come in and

1223
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:02,000
we'll take our core

1224
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:04,639
put on the soil on the top of the soil

1225
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,639
come in with our block and our hammer

1226
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:10,559
and hammer it down

1227
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,960
until you your soil level just

1228
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,719
just reaches the top of the can at this

1229
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,760
point you can smooth it out

1230
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,118
and then you're going to come in with a

1231
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,640
trowel trowel underneath it

1232
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,240
it's good to get a cap but if you don't

1233
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,879
want to get a cap you can use anything

1234
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,879
that's flat

1235
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:31,919
so cap one side of it flip it over

1236
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,838
smooth the soil out as well and

1237
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,200
this way you know now you have a known

1238
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,159
amount of volume of soil

1239
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,039
within this canister you can take this

1240
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,920
soil

1241
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,559
push it into a bag you take that bag of

1242
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
soil

1243
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,400
bring it home put on a put on a cookie

1244
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,279
sheet put it in your oven

1245
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,119
at 200 degrees for two or three hours

1246
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,920
until all the salt until all the

1247
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,960
moisture has evaporated out you can take

1248
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,240
that soil out

1249
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,480
allow it to dry and then weigh it

1250
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,838
and since you know the volume of your

1251
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,159
cylinder and the weight

1252
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,119
you can then figure out your weight by

1253
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,358
volume

1254
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,800
and therefore you know your bulk density

1255
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:09,679
uh the next kind of do yourself

1256
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,519
assessment

1257
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,199
is looking at soil resistance with a

1258
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,199
penetrometer

1259
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,960
these are available from cornell

1260
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,879
directly you can

1261
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,318
borrow them for a week at a time where

1262
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,200
we'll ship them out to you

1263
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,440
and you can get one of these

1264
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,358
penetrometers if you wanted to look at

1265
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,119
compaction across a lot of sites

1266
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,799
and the the main thing with these is

1267
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,838
that it's it's best to do it

1268
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,880
um kind of after it's rained a short

1269
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:34,400
period afterwards

1270
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,640
but if as long as you assess all your

1271
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,160
soils within a short time frame so the

1272
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,400
soils don't dry out too much

1273
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,239
you can get a pretty good relative

1274
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,599
indicator to each other

1275
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,959
but like i mentioned before they're

1276
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,119
pretty straightforward in how they work

1277
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,838
you've got a pressure gauge on one side

1278
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,039
and this is graduated so there's

1279
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,159
actually measurements

1280
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,480
on this pole specifically

1281
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,759
and as you push this down into the soil

1282
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,280
what you're going to see on the top

1283
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,200
is increased pressure the only

1284
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,480
caveat other than moisture on this is

1285
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,199
that there's two different

1286
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,199
tips you can get there's a 3 4 inch tip

1287
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,439
and a half inch tip

1288
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,639
and you only need to use the bigger one

1289
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,159
if you're working in very sandy soils

1290
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,759
next is texture texture by feel

1291
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,440
this is different than the way that the

1292
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
if you sent soils into the lab that they

1293
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,480
would

1294
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,318
look at texture but there's a number of

1295
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,838
resources available

1296
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,279
that are just flow charts where you can

1297
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:30,400
collect a small amount of your soil with

1298
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,480
a little bit of water

1299
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,440
and you can you can go through the

1300
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,358
practice

1301
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,880
of of assessing those soils and getting

1302
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,279
a texture simply by feel

1303
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,440
this is a common uh field assessment

1304
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,560
technique that a lot of

1305
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,159
farmers or land care practitioners or

1306
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,000
and certainly soil scientists will will

1307
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,799
develop so they can understand what the

1308
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,239
textures

1309
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
of their soil without going through the

1310
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,399
full test so

1311
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,680
at the bottom of this pa slide there's

1312
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,000
also a link available

1313
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,000
where you can find a texture by feel but

1314
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,119
there are a few out there

1315
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,079
the next one that you can look at is ph

1316
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,200
ph is another indicator that is very

1317
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,960
easy to assess

1318
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,679
on your own at cornell we sell

1319
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,440
ph testing kits they come in two

1320
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,000
different ranges they come in a wide

1321
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,960
range

1322
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,480
as well as a standard range your

1323
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,159
standard range being

1324
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,119
from ph of 5 to 7.2

1325
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,318
and you're in your wider range being

1326
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,920
from

1327
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,440
4 to point six uh and then we also offer

1328
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
one that's in the low range which is

1329
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,200
from

1330
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,680
four to six point two ph so you can buy

1331
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:44,318
a single one of these boxes for 12.50

1332
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,399
it will last you a very long time it's a

1333
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,599
pretty straightforward process of

1334
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,240
taking a small amount of soil placing it

1335
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,039
into these

1336
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,199
into these dishes and then using the

1337
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,599
different reagents

1338
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,399
and a color metric scheme to be able to

1339
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,480
tell

1340
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
what your range is in so particularly if

1341
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,559
you want to do a lot of

1342
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,039
sites across your campus you could buy

1343
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,239
one of these kits for 12.50

1344
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,039
and you'll be able to do a lot of

1345
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,118
assessments you compare this to the cost

1346
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,079
of doing the ph test on its own if you

1347
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,318
send it to the lab

1348
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,839
which is twelve dollars for one test so

1349
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,079
if you think you're gonna be doing

1350
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,000
uh even testing more than one site it's

1351
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,079
in it's worth it to invest within

1352
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,400
the ph kit and you can also follow the

1353
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,839
links on this powerpoint

1354
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,119
to get more information there's a few

1355
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:32,480
extra slides here that are just at the

1356
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,519
end of the presentation

1357
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,000
the first thing i want to share with

1358
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,679
people is a general workflow of

1359
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
what you might want to be thinking about

1360
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,239
if you want to implement the scoop and

1361
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,920
dump technique

1362
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,000
and the first consideration you want to

1363
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,358
think about is whether you have a site

1364
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,679
that is just

1365
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,159
top soil is present and it's just

1366
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,480
compacted or impacted

1367
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,078
you can follow this workflow and

1368
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,079
determine the best

1369
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,119
how much compost to apply and at what

1370
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,480
stage

1371
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,480
you can also use this technique if you

1372
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,559
are on a construction site where you

1373
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,519
strip the topsoil and have it stockpiled

1374
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,358
somewhere else

1375
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,440
you can use the scoop and dump technique

1376
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,838
on that lower subsoil level

1377
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,720
to improve your soil quality when you

1378
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,039
reapply

1379
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,639
your topsoil at the end and a lot of

1380
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:20,079
work

1381
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:23,759
by susan day has focused specifically on

1382
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,280
this technique of removing topsoil and

1383
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,920
putting it back on

1384
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,359
along with the scoop and dump technique

1385
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,200
or the profile

1386
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:35,838
rehabilitation as she calls it

1387
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,519
this last slide is a slide of just some

1388
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,920
basic measurements for understanding

1389
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:42,159
bulk density

1390
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,240
it's just gives you the equation for

1391
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,639
finding the volume of a cylinder

1392
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,078
which is a very simple equation and one

1393
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,960
you need to

1394
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,039
know to figure out the specific bulk

1395
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,639
density

1396
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:58,558
of soil and last but not least

1397
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,879
there is some additional resources and

1398

comprehensive testing of either composts

1409
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,838
or soils

1410
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,000
for nutrients and with that i want to

1411
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,799
