1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,520
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,519
university

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,359
uh thank you very much for inviting me

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,919
uh

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,759
yeah my name is hendrik joyman a hard

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,879
thing to say

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,480
i'm

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,000
working at the swedish university

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,839
culture i will i will show you some

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,679
picture from that but

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,679
i just want to say that i'm not a native

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,759
english speaker so bear in mind that

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,439
sometimes i get quiet

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,359
and then i go through a crisis in my

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,640
head to find the right words

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,640
and if i say penis i mean pinus

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
and we talk about pine trees nothing

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
else

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
so i pronounce probably things a little

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,640
bit different so i just want to make

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:49,599
sure everybody on the same page okay

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,159
so just an introduction sweden i've been

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
here for some times in the us and sweden

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,718
and switzerland is something you have

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,718
come some problem with

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,719
sweden

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,320
where is it

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,640
switzerland you see

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
okay that's a different all right

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
so sweden this is where i come from it's

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
a big country one of the biggest country

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,959
in europe this map is probably drawn by

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,719
swedish because it's actually bigger

34
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,039
than it is actually

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,560
but the thing is we have a

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
big country

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
from north to south to north

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
which means we have a lot of different

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
kind of climates in the country but

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,719
still we have a really good climate by

41
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,959
the way

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,560
uh even if we are very northern country

43
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,319
because we have the gold stream just go

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
by here and makes our climates better

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,319
than we actually should have so we have

46
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,319
a very mild climate and it's actually

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,879
very similar to new england when it

48
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,118
comes to the climate this new york new

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
hampshire connecticut vermont that's

50
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,438
kind of climate we actually have up

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,439
there

52
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,359
but we are much much northern and in new

53
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,639
england

54
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,078
uh

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,239
this is uh i've stole pictures and con

56
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,919
part here uh this is how it looks in the

57
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,000
south in southern sweden very

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,159
agriculture this is in the north a lot

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,399
of mountains and this is something in

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
between where i come from a lot of

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,800
forest this is actually a picture in the

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,439
midnight we have this thing i missed

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,680
here is the nights you have dark nights

64
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,919
in the summer we have very light nights

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
for two months we doesn't have any dark

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,199
nights we just have 24 hours daylight in

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,719
sweden which i prefer and this is how it

68
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
looks in it

69
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,318
so this is just an introduction to

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
sweden then you know you should go this

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,560
beautiful country

72
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,079
the campus this is the campus i come

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,479
from the swedish university of

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
agriculture science is a campus or it's

75
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,959
a university that are spread all over

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,599
the country we are

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,840
in the north in umu where the university

78
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,280
focus on forestry and fishing

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
we are up

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,878
also in uppsala

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,239
where is more agriculture an animal

82
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,959
type of

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,280
direction and in the south where i live

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,680
or where i work it's

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,000
more hot to culture landscape planning

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
that kind of direction so this is our

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,639
campus which is in a very in a very

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,959
urban area and the campus is like a

89
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,039
green island we have malmo in the back

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,239
this is luma and lund and you can see

91
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,919
how flat it is a very strong agriculture

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,599
and the campus is very old so

93
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,798
this is the arboretum which is the

94
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,238
biggest tree collection on the

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,879
collection of buddhist fish in northern

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,000
europe and have trees that are over 350

97
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,878
almost 400 years old it's a very big an

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,878
old

99
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,719
place and this is a castle in the middle

100
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,840
of the park and this is where i have my

101
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,759
office

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
so why i'm showing this is actually i

103
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,039
would like to invite you researcher

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,439
because we have something that we are

105
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,679
very proud of we have something called

106
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,639
the landscape laboratory

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,519
a thing that we are very unique in

108
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,719
we have a we allowed us to if we come up

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,280
with an idea try to design a woodland

110
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,719
for example a chinese or american or

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,640
just a nice design woodlands we allow us

112
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,680
to build it in scale one to one to see

113
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,598
how it works how it works over time

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
so in our campus we have a landscape

115
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,679
laboratory that is today 60 hectare

116
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
large and increasing every year with new

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,959
plantation where we're building things

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,079
just to see how it works in a full scale

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,319
and a good thing with landscape

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
laboratory that we don't have any end

121
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,560
date of the research

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,360
we can plan things and just following

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,360
for 10 15 50 100 years it doesn't matter

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
and so

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,600
the lack of the landscape laboratory

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,520
today is that we would like to have more

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
international researcher in

128
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,719
in the research group dealing with the

129
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,879
landscape laboratory you can see it's

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
some of the here

131
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,199
we're also working with wetlands storm

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,879
water management but also the research

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,319
field here belongs to the landscape

134
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,199
laboratory

135
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,120
this is like the blue grass lane but

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,800
much much bigger

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,800
and much cooler i think

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,400
sorry nina sorry pat all right

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
that was just an introduction but i will

140
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,918
do another introduction because the

141
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
research i'm doing together with nina

142
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,560
and company is where it's most of my

143
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
towards urban plants and special urban

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
trees

145
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,918
and special towards selection selection

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
of new species into urban environments

147
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,639
and in order to understand that i would

148
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,198
like to do just a short introduction of

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,199
how and why we're doing this

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
because international this is the

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,360
problem not only in sweden or

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,439
scandinavia but also here in the us but

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,639
all over the world there is a lack of

154
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,800
diversity when it comes to urban trees

155
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,800
this is a study we

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,680
finished a couple years back

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,918
where we evaluated the scandinavian

158
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
region when it comes to the diversity of

159
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,279
urban trees

160
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,519
and it's pretty scary numbers if you

161
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,599
have problems just talk with nina about

162
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,879
her in the inventory this weekend and

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
she'll now remember nowhere made

164
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,680
bernoulli maple but when it comes to

165
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,758
sweden it's limelight lime and lime

166
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
or in the scandinavian region but this

167
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,600
is pretty scary when you see that

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,000
almost 45 percent of all street trees in

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,800
helsinki the capital of finland it's

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,759
just one species of lion

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,520
linden okay linden lime we said yeah

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,439
linden then

173
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,198
sorry uh

174
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,120
but that's just the street trees health

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
secret haven't inventory other trees but

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,319
if you come to oslo the capital of

177
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,239
norway they have in their tree database

178
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,160
where which we use in order to do this

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,639
kind of evaluation

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,880
they also including public trees that

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
are in park environment but still you

182
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,800
can see even if you have street and

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,759
parking line it's just four three

184
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,000
species and stands for half of the whole

185
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,439
tree population

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,038
and this of course is not we talk about

187
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,598
sustainability and longevity and how

188
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,598
sustainable our urban environment is and

189
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,159
this is not

190
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,959
sustainable when you rely on very few

191
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,199
species in order to deliver in not only

192
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,198
the beautification of urban areas but

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,360
also as trees start to be more and more

194
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,598
important in order to deliver different

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,759
kind of ecosystem services for example

196
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,079
stormwater management

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,160
urban heat island mitigation

198
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,240
in sweden is a big thing we use trees in

199
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
order to have wind shelter in order to

200
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,000
reduce cooling down buildings which

201
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,000
increase the cost of heating up the

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,038
buildings and so on so tree is starting

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,199
to be very very important stuff in an

204
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:37,199
urban environment and if you just rely

205
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,199
on few species that's very risky things

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
in the same study we also evaluate to

207
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,520
see are there any differences between

208
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,519
different kind of urban habitats for

209
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,198
example street environment or park

210
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,799
environment and this is of course it's

211
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,240
not rocket science it's pretty common

212
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
sense that it is

213
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,840
easier to find a great catalogue of

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
species that grows well in park

215
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,719
environment because the park environment

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
they

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
have better growing condition compared

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
to a street environment so if you find a

219
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
few species that grow in street

220
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,239
environment well or perform rather well

221
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,160
you just go for them over and over again

222
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
so much of my research and together with

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,160
nina is towards street environments here

224
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,000
can you see there is less diversity

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,919
compared to park environment and this

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,879
just an example of an oslo

227
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,598
so much of the research we do in nina

228
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
is towards street environment because in

229
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,598
hard

230
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,239
surface landscape so to say is the need

231
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,279
of a great catalogue of great performing

232
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,519
trees

233
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,759
very very important to find

234
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,799
because in the paved environment the

235
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,399
need of trees is more important compared

236
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
to street environment because the few

237
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,799
trees that are allowed in the pearl

238
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,359
paved environment needs to deliver much

239
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,039
much more compared to trees just in park

240
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
environment because that's

241
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,399
easier for example stormwater management

242
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
and so on

243
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
so much of the research is towards

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,919
street environments

245
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,639
but i will continue because if you just

246
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,240
focus on few tree species this is what

247
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,679
can happen

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,720
this is

249
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,039
a nice picture of a less nice thing this

250
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,680
is the asian longhorn beetle

251
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,759
which is one of many threats to trees in

252
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,759
urban environments we just finished

253
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,439
studying a study which was published

254
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,559
earlier this year of

255
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
the

256
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,000
host range of trees that this bug or

257
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,159
asian longhorn bugs can can

258
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,360
attack and this is the result for the

259
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,199
asian longhorn beetle 137 species in

260
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
general

261
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,879
this is another bug

262
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,399
citrus longhorn beet is even worse this

263
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,399
is the one we have in europe

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,519
actually naturalized in italy moving

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,159
north and this is the big problem

266
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
so you see this map

267
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,719
few species

268
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,399
many diseases and insect attacks it's

269
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
not a good

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,639
calculation

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,919
so what we need is of course increase

272
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,319
the catalog species increase and also

273
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,759
start to using rare and untraditional

274
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,200
species species that don't get affected

275
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,200
of for example this one

276
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,799
but the problem is and this is another

277
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
problem for us

278
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,919
in a scandinavian country we are poor

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
extremely poor we we live actually one

280
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,719
of the poorest regions of the world when

281
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,838
it comes to native tree species here in

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,240
new york state you have disgusting rich

283
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,320
when it comes to native tree species

284
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
it's provocative to go out in the forest

285
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
here just to name drop all the trees

286
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
i'll just give you an example how poor

287
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,240
we are

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,560
this is the wooded horses it's like this

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
national symbol in sweden i'm very sad

290
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,759
that you

291
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,720
the story behind it is just very

292
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:48,480
ridiculous i don't tell you but this is

293
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
it's a native horse it's a wooden one

294
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
but each horse hairs it represents one

295
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
species or represent the species that we

296
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,719
have we have 30

297
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:02,958
34 native tree species in sweden 34.

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,120
so if you add diseases or insect attack

299
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,679
that attacking them now or will in a

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,639
short future attack the trees

301
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,519
we end up with this one

302
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,319
but if you also add urban pave size to

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,039
see which of these species this one that

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
can grow in this kind of habitats

305
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,719
which are

306
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:26,639
really challenging for trees

307
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,480
we end up with four tree species

308
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,879
so the thing for us scandinavian people

309
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,440
we can't rely on native only so we get

310
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,240
really provocative when we hear people

311
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
native only because we can't deliver

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,600
that in sweden i just want to make you

313
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,680
sure

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,759
so this is the result pretty pissed off

315
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,159
we get frustrating

316
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:51,039
how to do this so the challenge we are

317
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,759
doing or to stand in front of in

318
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,278
in sweden anyway is we have a lack of

319
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,600
diversity

320
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,519
we have many diseases

321
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
and also insect attack that attack in

322
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
our trees

323
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,759
and we have very few native tree species

324
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,160
so what we need is actually work with

325
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,679
more exotic tree species three species

326
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,240
that are reading from other parts of the

327
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,000
world but still grows in the climate

328
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
that are comparable to sweden that grows

329
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,639
well in sweden

330
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,560
but at the same time it's important

331
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
to find guidance

332
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,719
because you can't

333
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,199
be angry of on

334
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,120
landscape architecture tree planners

335
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
when they continue to use that

336
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,480
additional plant materials

337
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
because

338
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
think about it if you are a tree plant

339
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,440
and working on a very prestigious

340
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,278
project in the central new york city

341
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,639
you don't start to

342
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,720
use a very

343
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,200
rare or a plant material never used

344
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,040
before you don't do that

345
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,560
because if you do it you'll be very

346
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,799
famous for the guy that planted trees

347
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,199
that died half a year later you want to

348
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,199
work with safe materials

349
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,680
so as a researcher i see

350
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,759
it's our job to try to convince tree

351
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,679
planters to find evidence

352
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,679
of this rare and untraditional tree

353
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,879
species to find guidance for tree

354
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,399
planners in order to start to use them

355
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,278
because we can't force them we have to

356
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,078
find some kind of ground for them

357
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,360
so what we had done the last 10 years

358
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,439
is this

359
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
to traveling around the world to

360
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
actually studying

361
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,399
habitats natural habitats

362
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,399
which have clear similarities

363
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,799
to urban habitats

364
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,759
in sweden so these are just a few

365
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,599
examples this is from caucasus

366
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,919
is actually for chechnya

367
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,800
a place where i not recommend to go on a

368
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,519
vacation but they have fantastic

369
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,479
flora there and also climate which are

370
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,240
more than less identical to

371
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,720
in the city environment for example in

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,278
copenhagen or in stockholm

373
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,800
but also carpathian mountain in romania

374
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,759
i just showed this picture to nina

375
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,359
before you can see the bulb flowering do

376
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,078
you see that

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,399
it's kolchikum autumnale

378
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,479
a late flowering bulb one of the most

379
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,000
poisonous plants we know this is pretty

380
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
impressive that this horse is still

381
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,320
alive

382
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,959
and also us of course both west and east

383
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
and u.s

384
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,559
is areas

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
we studying a lot

386
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,159
so this is some of the parts of the

387
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,439
world we have been traveling around in

388
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,838
order to studying habitats and see which

389
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,120
other trees can we use but also try to

390
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,920
find evidence or guidance of how they

391
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,320
could be a good urban tree for us and

392
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,198
start to replace the one we're using too

393
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,720
much today or will get affected in a

394
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,958
short future

395
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
so you can see that the research is

396
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,159
really fun a lot of traveling but also a

397
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,000
lot of walking in mountains

398
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,480
so what we start with in the work is

399
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
start to do this kind of calculation so

400
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
we do different kind of calculation to

401
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,680
see which kind of areas of the world

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,079
have similarities to our not only our

403
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,919
climate but also trying to see which

404
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,399
kind of growing habitats can we

405
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,198
calculate to see similarities for

406
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,360
example this is from northeast romania

407
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,159
and the republic of moldavia where we're

408
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,720
trying to find just areas which have

409
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,360
similarities to paid environments in

410
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,079
copenhagen for example in a calculation

411
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,800
we try to add all the information or all

412
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,319
the factors that influence trees in paid

413
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,719
environment

414
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,079
and try to see where in other parts of

415
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
the world can we find more or less

416
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,198
exactly the same growing condition and

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
then we go there and try to find try to

418
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,039
understand it even more which kind of

419
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,838
species grows there and so on

420
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,919
i will i will explain a little further

421
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
so we start to just make an example of

422
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,599
one of these case studies this is from

423
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,920
the chingling mountain in china

424
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,480
where i've been several times and my

425
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,719
first year as a phd student i went here

426
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,680
for a whole year lived here and actually

427
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,759
i met a person from cornell here vinay

428
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,919
in this department so he's the one

429
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,278
actually introduced me to nina

430
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,360
and thanks to him i'm here today

431
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,720
probably

432
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,399
but the tingling mountain is an

433
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,959
interesting area for us in a way because

434
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,000
a recent collection from china is from

435
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:18,638
this area the cechon and yunnan area and

436
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,559
also the the eastern of tibet

437
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,399
which is probably the most specie-rich

438
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,278
region of the world

439
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,759
where you can find a fantastic

440
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,000
richness of species but the problem here

441
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,879
in this area the thing is not hard

442
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,278
enough for us in scandinavia

443
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,320
so many scandinavian went up here to the

444
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,519
manchuria area to the border to north

445
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,160
north korea and mongolia russia and

446
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
northeast china but the problem up here

447
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,319
the plants are too hardy the two

448
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,439
continental starts too early in the

449
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,639
spring grow too long in autumn and are

450
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,079
not good

451
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,159
actually they are better in northern

452
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,319
sweden than in the southern sweden

453
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,319
because they are too continental as i

454
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
said so some

455
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,680
so the area we are testing of course

456
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,759
we're traveling around in china to

457
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,078
collect to see which area actually could

458
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,199
be the best one and we ended up in

459
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:13,678
between in the chingling mountain china

460
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,120
if you like if you like panda bears this

461
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
is the place to go

462
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,958
and i will explain how panda bears are

463
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,558
one of the most hated animals for us to

464
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
collect plants

465
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,639
but i will explain later on

466
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,440
and it includes a lot of alcohol

467
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,000
but this area is actually it's not too

468
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
mild from this and the mountain is high

469
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
enough almost 4 000 above sea level

470
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,240
meter above sea level so still you can

471
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,000
find some of the elevation it's more or

472
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,960
less comparable to inner city

473
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,759
environment of the scandinavian area

474
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,400
so of course calculation to calculate

475
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,160
how good they are and then we go out in

476
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
the field to work

477
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,679
and if you believe field work is a

478
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
glamorous work

479
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
you're pretty wrong this is how it looks

480
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
this is in a farmer's house

481
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,720
i'm spooning with this is my driver

482
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,919
mr ma

483
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,160
and this is the students lyon leon

484
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,320
followed two two times and then he said

485
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
i'm never gonna follow you again because

486
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,759
it was a little bit too too high

487
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,759
mountain for walking so me and mr ma

488
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,558
were together for a whole year so i know

489
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,558
him very well very close

490
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,119
and this is the dinner every night

491
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,359
noodles and beers this is the candles

492
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:30,079
and the most important thing is to drink

493
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,798
beer so you sleep before mr ma because

494
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,399
when mr master to snore it's impossible

495
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,079
to sleep

496
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,000
but he missed the mice very nice guy

497
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,960
because when he drive over this kind of

498
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,798
bridges he asked me to step out and see

499
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,400
and then he drive over first a couple of

500
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,558
times and then you come and get me and

501
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,000
then we drive over so it's a it's a nice

502
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,759
guy

503
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,079
so this is how it is and this was

504
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,160
actually for a whole year mr ma and me

505
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,399
working in the in the chingling mountain

506
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,080
because the problem working in china is

507
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,480
that there is no good

508
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,199
literature not even for

509
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,599
chinese to to to read about the flora

510
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,038
system how the the different kind of

511
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,000
plants grows in different kind of

512
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,519
habitat different kind of elevations on

513
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,839
so the first two or three months was

514
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,400
just for me and mr ma traveling around

515
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,558
climbing up and down walking up and down

516
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
in order to start to learn how the flora

517
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,879
system are together and how different

518
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,799
species grow in different kinds of

519
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
habitats and so on which is a great job

520
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,839
but it's also frustrating when you have

521
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,679
a phd coming that you have to publish

522
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,720
papers all thing

523
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,120
but it's it's good fun

524
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,000
but this is how it works

525
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,959
in order to find we find an elevation

526
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,558
for in this case fifteen to two thousand

527
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,079
fifteen hundred to two thousand meter

528
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,759
above zero this is the place where the

529
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,798
climates are more or less

530
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,720
uh

531
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,038
exactly the same as in the city

532
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,880
environment of scandinavian but in order

533
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,119
to find the right habitats and right

534
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,640
growing condition the microclimate we

535
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:05,279
have to find it and that's found up here

536
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,120
on the warm south facing slope which

537
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,119
looked like this

538
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,558
so this that's why this is not the the

539
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,719
most nice place to go because you have

540
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,079
to tie yourself to a tree otherwise you

541
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,400
just

542
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,839
drop down here so it's that's why this

543
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,159
student stopped the work of just two

544
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,879
times the thing is this is how it works

545
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,240
and here you can find habitats that more

546
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,640
or less are have strong similarities to

547
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,359
to paved sites for example when it gets

548
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,559
warm and very dry especially after when

549
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:40,319
the snow melts or when after

550
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,279
a rain it dries up very quickly

551
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,399
which is

552
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,720
what it is in in paved environments

553
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,280
and this is the field work of course in

554
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,919
the morning two hours climb up here do

555
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,000
the work inventor in the tree take soil

556
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,080
sample drill the tree measuring the

557
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,079
trees all together gives you good

558
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,720
information of which species grow on

559
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,879
these sites and what the sites

560
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,279
represent but also you can see which

561
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,600
trees grows quick and with trees grows

562
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,639
very slow on these sites and that makes

563
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,399
you good information how to collect next

564
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
one how to collect the species that you

565
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
should because you're more interesting

566
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
in the trees that can tolerate this

567
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,960
growing condition but at the same time

568
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,000
grow quickly fast and delivering in a

569
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,840
rather short time skater anyway

570
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,480
because earlier

571
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,558
collection is just out collect seed

572
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,558
taken home and start to grow and it

573
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,879
takes two three generation of gardeners

574
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,839
because before you you start to learn

575
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,360
about the plants but by doing this you

576
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,879
can do a first screening in the field to

577
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,279
don't collect of the trees that don't

578
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,679
have the future as urban tree and focus

579
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,359
on the one that have the great potential

580
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,759
so this is the the work we have done

581
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,798
here in china

582
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,119
and

583
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,960
this is just an example of things that

584
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,519
we do in feed in order to communicate

585
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,759
with tree planners and also researcher

586
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,918
of the findings we do in field here we

587
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,480
have a slope it's a very sharp slope

588
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,720
this top of the

589
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,480
the ridge is just one meter so you go on

590
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,558
balance when you're walking here but

591
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
here you have a north facing slope

592
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,798
here's a south facing slope so the

593
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,360
distance from here to here

594
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,519
is just 20 meter that's it

595
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,279
but the species

596
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,079
combination between these slopes are

597
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,639
completely different on the south slope

598
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,439
we have plants that have the strategy

599
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
to

600
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,360
handle

601
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,000
warm and sometimes really really dry

602
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,079
conditions so here you find almost just

603
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
oaks

604
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,199
winter green oaks but also broadly oaks

605
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,679
and also two and one in needle pines

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
but on the south facing slope instead

607
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,360
here it's just more moist because after

608
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,200
a rain it dries up much slower

609
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,759
and it's not that warm so the

610
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,440
transpiration is less compared to the

611
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:01,038
south facing slope so the plants here

612
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
they are

613
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,839
very much needed to have moist and cool

614
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,519
condition but in the other hand they are

615
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,079
more shade tolerant

616
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,319
because they have to compete so the

617
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,960
restriction is not below ground

618
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,439
restrictions are above ground so these

619
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,558
trees are park trees that are very

620
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,320
successful in moist rich habitats and

621
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,000
also really good to compete in this kind

622
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,399
of empire environment

623
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,839
on this side restriction are not the

624
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,679
sunlight because there's a lot of

625
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,279
sunlight you can see the tree crown get

626
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,919
a lot of sunlight through but the

627
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,918
restriction is below ground and that's

628
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,000
how it is in urban condition for example

629
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,919
overpaid environment restrictions are

630
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,919
below ground not above ground

631
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,918
running water

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
sorry

633
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
so in this condition it seems like the

634
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,199
water is always running through the

635
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,839
slopes

636
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,840
because you know it's it's the trees are

637
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,678
on the sides of a mountain yeah so they

638
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,558
don't have stagnant water in this

639
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,919
country

640
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,240
but in

641
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,038
urban conditions if they're

642
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,038
usually irrigated

643
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,759
that's the design on planting pages

644
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,240
you're never ever

645
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,000
uh allowed to have standing water in the

646
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
planting pits that that's then then you

647
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,240
have done a wrong design of your

648
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,880
planting pits that's that's bad so you

649
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,519
should have well drained always also in

650
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,159
in in the in the planting pit as well so

651
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,400
drainage is is a key thing in urban

652
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,320
plantation anyway

653
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
so if it's watered down something wrong

654
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,200
that's not good

655
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,080
so

656
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
this is just an example uh

657
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,839
that you can see the difference between

658
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,519
different habitats but also when you go

659
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,759
out in the field you can see the use

660
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,240
potential of the trees when you are in

661
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,640
in natural habitats

662
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,519
and this is just some of the findings

663
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,759
china

664
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,879
is extremely rich in species many

665
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,119
species have never ever been grown in

666
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,960
our outside china for example this

667
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:04,879
almost cloud sessions eco

668
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,880
never been outside um

669
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,278
china and now it's in cultivation at in

670
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,599
all night but also we have shared to the

671
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,919
kew garden in in the uk just to be sure

672
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,278
that if our dies we still have some in a

673
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,520
queue and so on

674
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,839
this is a small leaf l you can see the

675
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,639
bark looks like the cell cover

676
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,359
and it grows really really well and fast

677
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
on this extremely dry habitats

678
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,359
and doesn't have any problem with the

679
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,440
dutch and the sea so suddenly

680
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,038
this is a good urban tree especially for

681
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,440
paid environments

682
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,798
but also you can find trees that

683
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,159
we know for a very exclusive parking lot

684
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,278
arboretum

685
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,278
but they have never go outside this

686
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,359
arboretum or botanical garden because we

687
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,359
don't know enough about them

688
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,119
but this habit of study gives more

689
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,240
information about them for example

690
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,759
exocordo geraldo de sistafilla holocarpa

691
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,599
i won't say an english name because i

692
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,640
have no idea what's the english name on

693
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,719
them

694
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,880
but these are available in arboretum but

695
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
through this habit of study we can start

696
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,200
to know more about it and start to use

697
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,679
them maybe in more public plantation and

698
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,000
so on so this kind of research is not

699
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,759
only to collect new things it's equally

700
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,759
important to find more information or

701
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,599
things that we have around us but we

702
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,359
don't dare to use because we don't know

703
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,678
enough about them

704
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,079
just a more example of this peonia so

705
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,200
froticosa this is the growing habitat

706
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,199
where it grows more rocky places

707
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,558
this is just two examples of

708
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,600
cordless tree growing hazel's this

709
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,119
cordless var jci with this peeling

710
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,319
orange bark and this is cordless

711
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,719
chinensis

712
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,678
which have a bark that looks dissimilar

713
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,960
to shag bark hickory it's two beautiful

714
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,720
trees that have never been in a more hot

715
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
culture perspective but they have the

716
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,880
potential to become very very good

717
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,360
horticulture trees

718
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,200
sorry are they nuts

719
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,278
yeah

720
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,640
and the correlations have very close

721
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,240
relationship with the

722
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,720
cordless columnar which is more common

723
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
in cultivation actually hybrids hybrid

724
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,600
days

725
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
together when they meet each other in

726
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,319
the central asia somewhere so the one

727
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,359
which are coalitions in cultivation

728
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,240
together

729
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,000
today is this hybrid so the true

730
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,839
correlations is not available in

731
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,359
cultivation today

732
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,079
because they don't have this bark this

733
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,079
beautiful bark

734
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,480
and also some early flowering trees

735
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,558
and also some late flowering trees for

736
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,720
example coral coralteria panucolata the

737
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,398
chinese tree that grows more or less on

738
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
bare rock one of the most drought

739
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,719
tolerance trees and the research me nina

740
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,599
doing here cornell which i'll hopefully

741
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,519
show you later on also show that it's so

742
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,759
so drought tolerant and it's this

743
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,759
perfect tree for the urban environments

744
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,038
special i just took this picture because

745
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,000
it's a

746
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,359
it's a big leaf the guy is 180 tall you

747
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,519
know

748
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,439
not really

749
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,519
another case study romania moldavia i

750
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,640
just want to go through here same thing

751
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,798
calculation about the habitats and why

752
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,960
romania and the eastern europe is one of

753
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,200
the most interesting area of the world

754
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,600
when it comes to climate smart trees for

755
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,159
urban environment is that we already

756
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,199
have a climate east of carpathian

757
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,399
mountains

758
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,240
this is europe sweden switzerland

759
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,879
we have the alps

760
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,798
we have the carpathian star shop here

761
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,200
and goes like this down this is

762
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,119
transylvania where the dracula lives

763
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,159
do you know that

764
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,119
but east of the mountains here

765
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,679
the west winds the moist winds from the

766
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,639
atlantic from the gulf stream more or

767
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,798
less ends here in transylvania

768
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,399
so the west part of the transylvania is

769
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,679
very wet very moist very rich big trees

770
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,599
big forest

771
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,159
but in the east

772
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,319
no much rain comes over the carpathian

773
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
so we have more or less as i said on the

774
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,639
east side the rocky mountains we have it

775
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,759
here very dry

776
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,440
cold winters cold and dry winters warm

777
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,558
and dry summers

778
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,480
so this area east of the carpathian here

779
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,720
but also down here in the caucasus

780
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,278
region have more or less exactly the

781
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,278
climate and growing condition as we find

782
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:20,558
in city in the city environment when we

783
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,880
add

784
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,119
urban heat island infections on so

785
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,880
that's why we have been a lot in eastern

786
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:31,359
europe to try to investigate trees

787
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,760
but the landscape is not that sexy this

788
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,000
is not the place you go when you visit

789
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,398
europe the first time it's better places

790
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,759
but this is how it looks this great huge

791
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,759
steps and the steps are mostly

792
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,359
famous for their meadows

793
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:49,759
this is the meadows this is a ukraine

794
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,158
ukraine zebra i just kidding this is

795
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,839
from a zoo in southern ukraine actually

796
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,840
now it's occupied by russia

797
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,839
where you can find some of the most

798
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,278
interesting meadows

799
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,798
uh of

800
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,200
of the step but just go through here you

801
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:09,398
can see how beautiful the step is when

802
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,399
it's flowering this is from romania

803
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,799
if you like perennial plants that could

804
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
be used for in roundabouts and or in

805
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,639
roof gardening and so on this is the

806
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,039
area to go because they are more or less

807
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,038
growing on the in that kind of habitats

808
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,240
but

809
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,038
in this step environment you also find

810
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,919
patches of forest

811
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:38,480
this very famous step forest of eastern

812
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,399
europe which includes many species and

813
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,278
this is how it looks when you do field

814
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,359
works i don't have mr ma with me and

815
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,240
here i'm alone

816
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,879
so this is the dinner in the field

817
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,759
it's a can ham

818
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,559
and when these cans of ham moves to

819
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,398
sweden they just change the label from

820
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,480
canned ham to cat food

821
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,798
because

822
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,038
because it it smell and taste probably

823
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,278
the same because that's that's the

824
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,798
dinner when you eat canned ham in a

825
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,640
romanian way

826
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,599
and i have a tip for you if you're

827
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,759
camping here don't throw apples

828
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,319
you haven't eaten outside a tent

829
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,079
because then the wild boar comes and the

830
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,839
wild boar here looked like the orcs in

831
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,359
the lord of the rings

832
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,119
and you don't want to have a couple of

833
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,719
wild boars fighting for your apples in

834
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,479
the middle of night i had that a couple

835
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,159
of times and that's scary it's very hard

836
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,079
to sleep after that kind of event

837
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,000
but that's how it is so you know it's

838
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,759
not that glamorous to do this kind of

839
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,839
research

840
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,158
but the thing is what you find here

841
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,240
it's some of the most interesting trees

842
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,039
for urban environments for example

843
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,798
service terminology that's the the one

844
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,079
growing here with these beautiful autumn

845
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,918
colors and the oaks here

846
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,158
are the quercus franet and the hungarian

847
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,679
oak which is one of the most drought

848
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,039
tolerant but also one of the most

849
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,759
beautiful oaks

850
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,119
for urban environments but also

851
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,240
silver linden

852
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,599
is that right

853
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,440
yeah tilia tormentosa which also

854
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,879
is one of the most drought tolerant

855
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,880
among the linden trees anyway

856
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,918
so you can see here some of the species

857
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,799
are in cultivation we have them we don't

858
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,640
use them so what we believe is in

859
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,038
through this habit of study we can find

860
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,120
more evidence to convince both nursery

861
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,200
to start to to produce them in higher

862
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,719
numbers and bigger trees but also

863
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,919
convince landscape architects and

864
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,159
planners to find or to start to use them

865
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,278
so it's not only to just grab new trees

866
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,840
but also

867
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,558
convince people to start to use them

868
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,599
but

869
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,599
one

870
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,839
thing when it comes to plant hunting and

871
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,278
trying to find good things is that you

872
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,000
don't have to find

873
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:54,960
new species you can equal find better

874
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,839
types of already introduced species so

875
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,519
the planting hunt the plant hunting days

876
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,079
are far from over when it comes to

877
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,440
finding really really good horticulture

878
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,798
plants i will give you a couple of

879
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,798
examples here

880
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,240
this is a solution of 100 years old

881
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:13,038
mystery i will tell you about you know

882
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,159
wilson ernest wilson rather famous plant

883
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,798
hunter he was actually hired in arnold

884
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,640
arboretum in boston for many many years

885
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,000
and but the first time he was in china

886
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
to collect he was collecting the

887
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,398
dovetree but the same trip he wrote in

888
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,240
his diary that

889
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,319
today i saw some beautiful flowering

890
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,679
magnolias one was red flowering and one

891
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,519
was white

892
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,240
i must come back in autumn to collect

893
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,079
them and he did he went back in autumn

894
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,079
collect the seeds from that but when

895
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,079
he's sending home to vege nursery

896
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,038
because they was paying for the trip

897
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,519
there

898
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,679
he he accidentally mix

899
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,720
both the seed in the same box and send

900
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,519
it home

901
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,640
and then nursery took them and started

902
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,640
to

903
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,720
propagate them and they grow fine and

904
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
after five or six years this nursery

905
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,399
have a sellout because the man of the

906
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,919
nurses said i'm fed up with it i'm gonna

907
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,639
sell this nursery

908
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,440
so at that time there was a six

909
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,280
plants from this magnolia collection and

910
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,280
that was selling to different parts of

911
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
england one at kew garden one at

912
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,879
bottomland garden and one at carl hayes

913
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
castle in

914
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,199
in

915
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,199
cornwall

916
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,960
and then they started flowering so the

917
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,240
one abortnet and kewguarding looked like

918
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,599
this

919
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,759
big beautiful flowers white with this

920
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,879
purple base

921
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,040
and get the name magnolia springeri

922
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,078
but they wanted car his castle

923
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,039
oops

924
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
it

925
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,039
have

926
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,119
red pinkish really dark pinkish flower

927
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,519
and the unique with this thing is that

928
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,159
you have a similar strong color both on

929
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,159
the outside of the temples as inside of

930
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,320
the temple that's very rare because when

931
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,000
magnolia's flowering they have strong

932
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,919
colors on the outside

933
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,838
but when they open up

934
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,759
they have less color and lose much of

935
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:00,960
the color when they start flowering

936
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,599
so this

937
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,920
dark colored and magnolia springer i

938
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,240
kept the colors even when it's flowering

939
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,159
out it gives much much more color and it

940
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,439
gave the name diva

941
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,319
the best name for this plant

942
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,880
and

943
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,559
people i get very excited over this diva

944
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,559
and have used in a lot you know the

945
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,639
different kind of crossings but when you

946
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,440
read wilson's diary he said a whole

947
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:28,159
valley of this diva this dark coloring

948
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,039
magnolias so for 100 years plant hunters

949
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,799
and stupid people like us have been

950
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,679
traveling to this area to try to find

951
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,000
this valley but haven't been successful

952
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,919
so instead people said oh just a myth

953
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,838
just a mutation

954
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,960
something wrong no no

955
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,480
but we thought

956
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
since i'm going to spend a whole year in

957
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,559
china

958
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
why don't

959
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,039
doesn't we do

960
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,920
a test to find this valley anyway we can

961
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:57,358
find some good moments but the problem

962
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,440
is this area is very rich in pandas this

963
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,679
cute little bit bear and the problem

964
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,920
with this bear is that if it shows up in

965
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,598
a forest the government

966
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,519
throw out the people in the forest and

967
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,680
protect a huge

968
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,320
piece of forest for this panda and it's

969
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:14,879
impossible for western people to come in

970
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,838
in this forest to studying because there

971
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,240
is this damn panda

972
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,759
so if you go to beijing to try to find

973
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,159
some

974
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,800
paper to get into this area

975
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:30,159
no chance instead you have to go to the

976
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,920
area and drink yourself into there

977
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,799
so what you do is try to go to the

978
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,519
proven city and find the boss there and

979
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,160
try to drink you up in a hierarchy

980
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,039
and this is after about eight days of

981
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,480
constant eating and drinking

982
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,519
and this is the

983
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,838
the

984
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,838
the forestry uh the highest boss on

985
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,480
there and the forestry in this area and

986
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,480
this is the man from the communist party

987
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,960
so these guys we was drinking with for

988
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,719
about two days and it's not like one

989
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,960
drink this is the morning drink it's

990
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,358
about 11 in the morning we have early

991
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
lunch and this is

992
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,078
and this is how it looks later in the

993
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,359
evening

994
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,760
this is my friend alan we we we tried to

995
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,920
drink even not every night we tried to

996
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,440
split the night between us and i think

997
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,440
this night was alan's night

998
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,320
so anyway

999
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,720
after

1000
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,400
seven or eight days hard drinking this

1001
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,639
is actually how you go in caucuses as

1002
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,039
well so it's it's not only china but

1003
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,159
after some hard drinking we get the

1004
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,920
access into this area

1005
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,920
and we start to interview people have

1006
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,358
you seen this magnolia have you heard of

1007
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,880
it and after some couple of days driving

1008
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,719
we found this man

1009
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,800
we find actually a tree

1010
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,279
with this but as you see

1011
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,280
it had it at his home

1012
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
so we actually found the one we were

1013
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,040
looking for the one would have a strong

1014
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
color side on the inside of table the

1015
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,800
side the same as

1016
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,680
the outside of temple but still we would

1017
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,200
like to find the wild population

1018
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,559
of this

1019
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,799
this species or this type of magnolia so

1020
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,679
we continue to driving we have a small

1021
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,920
bus

1022
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,639
and we find a farmer that said yeah i

1023
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,960
know a guy that probably knows more and

1024
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,480
he and his family went into the van we

1025
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,880
went to his place

1026
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,358
and he said yeah but i know another guy

1027
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,519
that knows a guy so after a while we

1028
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,838
have like 20 people in a bus

1029
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,759
crowded driving

1030
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,599
and this is the place we ended up we

1031
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
finally found a guy that yeah i know a

1032
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,320
place go out the mountains take left

1033
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,079
take right go up there take left

1034
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,160
and this is the road

1035
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,200
so actually we park the car down here

1036
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:44,879
and walk up and when we go over a ridge

1037
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,879
we start to see these ones

1038
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,838
several are pink

1039
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:54,319
clouds in the valleys

1040
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:56,880
and when we get closer we saw these ones

1041
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,880
even better than the diva is collecting

1042
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,920
in the collection today

1043
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,240
so this is just an example there is

1044
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,559
more stuff out there so we actually are

1045
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,358
reintroducing this diva that was

1046
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:12,239
collected hundred years ago for from

1047
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:16,078
wilson and now we have collecting at

1048
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:19,279
least 40 new genotypes of these plants

1049
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,280
and hopefully we get more genes into the

1050
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,920
cultivation which we can do use for

1051
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,200
hybridization and so on but also we have

1052
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,680
found

1053
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,919
this dark pink flowering manolas in

1054
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:31,838
habitat which is much colder than the

1055
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,639
one the growth before so it must

1056
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,119
possible to find some good looking hardy

1057
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:41,039
divas in the future

1058
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,599
so just another example manuela biondi

1059
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,440
a really boring magnolia

1060
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,280
three centimeters large white with a

1061
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,559
little purple base

1062
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,280
and it's more

1063
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,639
taxonomic interesting

1064
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,160
but we thought it was interesting

1065
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,799
because magnolia beyond is one of the

1066
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,199
more hardest magnolias we thought we can

1067
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,760
use it as an as a good parents in order

1068
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,559
to find some hardy stuff

1069
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,280
and

1070
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,880
i was young then all right

1071
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,440
i don't like this picture but this is

1072
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,960
focus on this one okay

1073
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,639
this is a big head

1074
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,800
anyway uh

1075
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,480
after a while when we start to to try to

1076
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,720
find some i know la biondo we start to

1077
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,039
see the variation within the species

1078
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,959
and really quick we realized that the

1079
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,358
most boring type

1080
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,440
of the species is the one available in

1081
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,880
cultivation today and the more

1082
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,720
interesting types are still out there

1083
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,680
and this is just an example of the

1084
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,559
variation of the species magnolia beyond

1085
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,838
the eye

1086
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,838
so we go from this

1087
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,400
rather big

1088
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,599
seven to eight centimeter large

1089
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:54,079
flowering plant flowering magnolias to

1090
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,480
which have more like the tulip shape of

1091
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,920
the flower to this bigger ones this

1092
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,358
actually collected

1093
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,358
behind um a house where they throw all

1094
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,400
the rubbish there so actually the

1095
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,679
working name on this is a white trash

1096
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
this one

1097
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,480
so it's going to be a very popular thing

1098
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,800
here in the u.s we believe so we see but

1099
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,280
you can see there are so much things out

1100
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,519
there so the plant hunting today is

1101
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,760
actually to find the better ones that

1102
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,440
are in cultivation so in order to

1103
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,599
introduce

1104
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,039
rare or untraditional species it's

1105
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,119
important to find

1106
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,719
good looking types because some of the

1107
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,039
types which are available when you go to

1108
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,039
the kew garden or to arnold roberto

1109
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,559
morris arboretum some of them are the

1110
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,599
worst types

1111
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,679
there's still much out there

1112
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,680
just go through it albostonensis this is

1113
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,039
the type you buy in the nursery in

1114
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,879
holland this is how it looks in a while

1115
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,480
see the difference

1116
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,480
which i want to buy do you want to buy

1117
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,519
tila tormentosa this is how

1118
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,598
the species looks in cultivation good

1119
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,960
tree but look how it grows

1120
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,760
here

1121
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,599
it's impossible to prune or do something

1122
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,280
with even this one this is from the

1123
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,119
plantation here installing silver it's a

1124
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,040
good looking tree narrow tree crown but

1125
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,640
look how it looks inside

1126
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,480
this is a good tree for street

1127
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,559
environments but impossible to have a

1128
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,240
street environment because you have to

1129
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:19,920
hire up the tree crown in order to get

1130
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,000
buses or

1131
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,720
try cars underneath

1132
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,280
so what we did is spring we went down to

1133
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:31,279
yash in northeast romania i don't know

1134
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,560
if you read russian poems you do that

1135
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,560
you should it's good stuff

1136
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:40,960
josh is famous for its silver lines

1137
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,118
silver linden sorry because if you read

1138
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,000
russian poems they write beautiful

1139
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,000
things of yashi yash and it's beautiful

1140
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,800
avenues with silver linden and so on

1141
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,800
yeah that's that's famous one so what we

1142
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,640
did actually went down there for three

1143
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,599
days to do it on smash and grab to find

1144
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,719
some trees of silver limes that grows

1145
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,800
more

1146
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,719
as we want them as our urban trees so

1147
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,800
what we find is this one would have a

1148
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,399
central leader good tree archaic

1149
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,480
architecture in a tree crown this is

1150
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,200
another type

1151
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,679
and this is another so this is the thing

1152
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,559
we we do a lot of hunting to find better

1153
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,598
types of trees

1154
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,519
that could

1155
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,000
in order to find better types they could

1156
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:29,119
be more useful and start to uh

1157
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,639
would you say start to

1158
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,000
to be a good complement to the

1159
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:37,358
traditional plant materials that we have

1160
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,318
and um actually this was just a short

1161
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:43,759
introduction what we're doing and what

1162
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:46,400
we're doing now in uh here in uh

1163
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,560
in cornell is actually another project

1164
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,800
which is as a complement to this

1165
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,799
actually to learn more about how

1166
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,480
tolerable different species are we have

1167
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,318
a project we call shut the hell up or

1168
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,240
die

1169
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,800
which actually is what is all about

1170
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,559
trying to mapping how much a tree can

1171
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
shut the hell up when it comes to dry

1172
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,440
environment or wheat trees that can't

1173
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,079
shut the hell up or die really early

1174
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,920
because in sweden there are too many

1175
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,560
landscape architects that want to have

1176
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,440
magnolias in paved environment as a

1177
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,920
street tree but we have to show that no

1178
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,159
manola is not the good tree so what

1179
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,000
we're doing now we're trying to find to

1180
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,519
read the turbo loss point of trees in

1181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,239
order to see

1182
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,679
how much drought they can take before

1183
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,039
the cell structure in the leaves

1184
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,679
actually destroys and magnolias destroys

1185
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,679
very early which shows for the landscape

1186
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,000
planners and landscape they are not

1187
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,759
useful for pavement on the other hand

1188
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,159
there are other species for example

1189
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,599
eucomia or many oaks but also some of

1190
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,920
the air maples

1191
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,760
which have a very very high or low

1192
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,159
turbulence point sorry very low turbo

1193
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,640
loss point you can take very very high

1194
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,759
drought without get damaged in the

1195
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,519
leaves and it shows that these trees are

1196
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,440
better suited

1197
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,759
for urban pave sites so that's what

1198
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,079
we're doing now so what we actually if a

1199
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,280
general thing is trying to find

1200
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,519
pieces in the past to show that this

1201
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,079
species is better than that one and in

1202
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,759
that case we can start to argue that

1203
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,240
changing from the traditional plant

1204
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,319
material to a more untraditional and

1205
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,479
this work is not only to tree planners

1206
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,480
but also towards nursery in order to

1207
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,639
start to produce these untraditional

1208
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,639
tree materials all right thank you

1209
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,559
the ginkgos grow in sweden yeah kingdom

1210
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,838
goes very well yeah

1211
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,199
and gingko has started to be this

1212
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:49,679
rare plants from

1213
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,000
from an artery to become more and more

1214
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,199
planted and that's part of the work we

1215
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,639
have done to show that this is better

1216
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:01,598
for example than the luxuries

1217
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,598
yeah sure

1218
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,680
are you successful in uh transferring

1219
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,960
genetic material from china we were

1220
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,000
talking about that

1221
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,000
yeah

1222
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,838
and if you did

1223
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,838
how complicated the problem is smaller

1224
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:14,838
disease

1225
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,399
you have to have a collaboration

1226
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,160
together with a university so they have

1227
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,318
a very good collaboration together with

1228
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,318
uh

1229
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,119
university i think it's north west

1230
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,240
university of agriculture and forestry

1231
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,119
in china

1232
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,199
together but we do it as a researcher we

1233
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,760
don't do it as a commercial

1234
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,838
so what we need is that we can collect

1235
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,920
as a scientist it's possible for me to

1236
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,159
collect planted in my research field and

1237
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,318
see how it grows because in our research

1238
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,559
we have four hectares of plantings of

1239
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,880
chinese materials that we tested but in

1240
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,279
order to commercialize it we have to go

1241
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,119
back to china to to

1242
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,599
get a contract with them

1243
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,079
but it's impossible it's a waste of time

1244
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,000
to get a contract before you know how it

1245
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,599
will develop as an urban tree so you're

1246
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,318
better to collect it as a scientist

1247
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,039
because as a scientist i stand above

1248
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:17,279
some of the laws it's okay for me to do

1249
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,519
it but in order to commercialize it i

1250
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,119
have to have purpose from china but then

1251
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,920
you can go afterwards and it's possible

1252
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,519
to get afterwards to get the right paper

1253
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,280
in order to commercialize some of the

1254
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,280
trees that we play

1255
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,839
that's how it works the u.s is a good

1256
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,920
country because you never sign anything

1257
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,759
so it's very easy for me to come here

1258
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,519
and collect in eastern europe alongside

1259
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,559
the european union so that's even more

1260
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,719
easier

1261
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,000
the china is completely collected you

1262
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,159
have to have collaboration with the

1263
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,079
botanic garden or university otherwise

1264
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,920
it's more or less impossible

1265
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,519
i think we can take one more question

1266
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,880
from ken and then i think we're out of

1267
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,559
time

1268
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,480
how many years do you have to grow these

1269
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,160
typical trees before you can really

1270
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,000
evaluate them yeah

1271
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,239
well the first collection we did was

1272
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,119
2003

1273
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,039
uh

1274
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,280
when i was just a research assistant i

1275
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,039
had this boring job to take my backpack

1276
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,519
and go to china and collect for the

1277
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:13,039
professor that was my first job as a

1278
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:15,759
researcher but already 2003 that's

1279
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,279
10 years now or over 10 years you can we

1280
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,200
already start

1281
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,800
to to

1282
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,879
propagate some of the materials around

1283
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,280
that in order to test them how good they

1284
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,838
are appropriate so you can see all

1285
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,440
almost after

1286
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,960
four to seven years you see the

1287
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
potential of some of their blood

1288
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,480
pressure then you can propagate them and

1289
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:35,358
then we plot them

1290
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,039
on

1291
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:38,719
more places in sweden in order to

1292
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,639
evaluate the hardness

1293
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,519
and so on so

1294
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,279
it doesn't have to take 60 or 70 or 100

1295
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,400
years before you see

1296
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,920
there's some of the problems that are

1297
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,838
collected with nina here for example

1298
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,720
some of the maples but also some of the

1299
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,838
oats we can already see today after five

1300
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:58,558
or six years they grow so well have been

1301
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:01,358
taking so much to such a good

1302
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,920
have grown so good during some of the

1303
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,159
coldest winter we have for 50 years in

1304
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,079
sweden they are so interesting so we're

1305
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,159
gonna start the propaganda already now

1306
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,400
after the six or seven years because

1307
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,159
they have a good uh crown

1308
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,880
hierarchy hurricane

1309
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:19,440
with essentially everything so it's

1310
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,760
but some of the trees shows their

1311
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,318
potential much later some of them shows

1312
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,359
early some languages it's different

1313
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,358
it's a good answer

1314
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:33,119
yes all right thank you so much

1315
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:44,358
this has been a production of cornell

1316
